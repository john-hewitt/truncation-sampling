It's still an \"open\" investigation, and they're not looking for any drugs or illegal items, according to Teppei. As a reward, he wants to watch over his son Teppei, but that's not the only reason Teppei wants to get his father's attention. Unfortunately, Teppei cannot afford to put an appearance of himself as a well-mannered and obedient youth and when he discovers his father knows about a missing terrorist, he puts together a team to find and kidnap him.\n\nThen, a special guest appears and tells Teppei that his name's Kuroko. Teppei tells him to call him Kuroko again, but in the past they have referred to him as \"Ming-chan\" and \"Neo-Eri-Sonia-A\". They also have no idea what him and Teppei have been talking about, and thinks it's some sort of joke that he was introduced to them with such a nickname.\n\nKuroko returns and reveals to his father that Shiroe is missing and wants to talk to him. Teppei then realizes that Teppei's father is being carried by two men in camouflage, the kind of police infiltrators that he and the others have been planning to catch ever since they called for a special team for the investigation of two corrupt officials from Mizar that was missing without a trace. The team finds their target again and decides it's time to go get the press.\n\nAt the newly-formed Nakano Bar Association of Sumo Wrestlers, the leaders send a message through their members with instructions to meet up at the grand hall immediately. As they arrive, however, Beryl notices that they've gathered two policemen instead and begins to scold the three of them. Tsuchimikado Maeda attempts to defend the three without looking too hurt and reveals that the police officers have been hired by the New World and both Mizura and Taniguchi have been also impressed with their deal.\n\nAt the same time, Teppei tells Beryl that if they leave with the reporters to find their target, they will begin a criminal investigation within the New World. Although both Kuroko and Tsuchimikado grow uneasy at the thought of public and ceremonial events being taken over by people from their jurisdiction, they realize that they're forced to participate if they want to protect the places they respect the most.\n\nOn the steps of the grand hall, Tsuchimikado gets in a fight with Maeda and loses. As his body parts are being torn up, he tells Maeda he plans to attend to another incident. When Maeda asks what the incident is, Teppei calls him an amateur and keeps on speaking with him for a while. However, the policemen seem to have been hired by the Hitekyoshi cabal and Maeda becomes suspicious about what's going on. With a total of four policemen as bodyguards, Teppei and Kuroko head towards the nearby building. As he races up to the building, he appears to have taken an the Police Brigade's order because he holds both the \"Yi\" and \"Koi\" aspects of the Shin'ou-Inkigai.\n\nJournalist Natsumi Kageyama gets in Teppei and Kuroko's way and tells them to wait. The three of them hurry to find Natsumi but she suddenly reveals the kidnappers' identity. Teppei and Kuroko try to persuade her to leave and find Kuroko since she is a member of the First Independent Investigation Squad, and they try to convince Teppei to come with them. However, the journalists take them by surprise and even though they successfully coax Natsumi into leaving the area, she manages to get caught up in the terrorists' plan and her face is seared by both wounds she receives.\n\nMeanwhile, Kuroko demands to know what happened to his father and explains that he was kidnapped and that the terrorists who kidnapped him want to abduct the", "topp": "Concerto Chapter Info Volume: 29 Chapter: 269 Japanese Title: \u5354\u594f\u66f2(\u30b3\u30f3\u30c1\u30a7\u30eb\u30c8) Romanized Title: Konchiuto: Beniz\u016bru Pages: 18 Release Date: December 24, 2010 Anime:\n\nEpisode 246 (p. 4-17) Chapter Chronology \u2190 Previous Next \u2192\n\nChapter 269 is titled \"Concerto\".\n\nContents show]\n\nCover Page Edit\n\nThe cover features the first scene from the manga episode \"BENIZURA\" (p. 4-17).\n\nShort Summary Edit\n\nRyo and others are on the beach as they contemplate their situation as Shuten Douji's personification: Golden Judgement. They await the magic Rin-Bouken to determine their fate. When Koujirou, having sworn to defeat Shuten Douji in battle, chases her on the beach, Ryo and Chikage head to the offshore island where \"Shuten Douji\" is guarding the steps of the palace. Shuten Douji takes off her mask and reveals a beautiful, beautiful girl hiding in her magic.\n\nChapter Summary Edit\n\nOn the beach at the shore, Captain Jiro Seijuro, looking down from the helicopter hovering over the nearby sand, surveys the sea. He spots the marine mammal well located above the floor, a Doberman that promptly swims to him. Bending her way toward him, she apologizes for her behavior from a moment ago and tells him that she felt herself terrorized by the power of Shuten Douji. Noticing that this is none other than the girl who is constantly jumping at him, he agrees to look her up later, despite an intense desire to avenge her as the helpless hostage.\n\nRyo drags Chikage along to the island of Waizoji, which has been approaching time. Just then, two figures entered the scene: they were the men who separated them. Ryo and Shuten Douji ride the helicopter and approach the beach, but hear something then. Koujirou tells them that he couldn't find them in time so they should come down. The two women bear a huge grudge, and then Sheena enters the scene, revealing to them that she is responsible for their hiding in the island and supplies them with food and police watch.\n\nWhile ordering for the two to report back to the police station, they ask why, and Sheena reveals her identity. The men ask her to whom she wants to speak and she finds the two man who abducted her just as she would have before...a manifestation of Shuten Douji herself. Ryo begs to stay and watch her fight Shuten Douji, but the human has no room for allies on her island.\n\nA tense standoff has now unfolded in the face of a massive barrier. The footprints and shurikens are of Shuten Douji's bodyguards, who have cut the barrier away, dragging their fallen comrade in close. Ryo and Shuten Douji are here, still facing each other. Ryo breaks her silence with a shout, \"Why are you here?!\" They are angry with each other. To her, and to the mystery man, the explanation she had earlier stumped the female ninja: she will not accept no explanation of her own, no matter how shocking and perplexing it may be. The puma hovers over Shuten Douji. She is a barrier, and even though the puma has repaired the barrier, it was only temporary. Shuten Douji has lived in this island for a long time. With a wave of her shuriken, Shuten Douji takes the shurikens off of Ryo's colleagues and moves to wipe them all out.\n\nRyo faces Shuten Douji in an aerial battle. With a spinkick that tears off her head, she scores a kill on her. However, as she is about to defeat her, one of her trap appears at the end of the arena, holding her under her feet, and telekinetically rolling her on the beach. Shuten Douji attempts to deliver an invisible punch to Ryo but is easily blocked, making her miss and remain pinned in place. Shuten Douji runs towards the robot body and locks her on the wire with her shurikens. She grabs Ryo's weapons and heaves the robot over her shoulder. Since their allies are pinned, she is freed. By that time, a giant robot is pushing towards them along with its underwater, flaming enemies.\n\nThe rest of the twins come down and takes our of his leaves. They lament the loss of free food and drugs while commiserating about the stinging smell created by exploding ration packs. Shuten Douji talks about the power she has, and how the destruction has doomed many villages. By forcing themselves to move in complete isolation from humans, it is like being a giant fish in a bowl.

This invigorates the two, and Conis makes a vow to get Usopp and Sanji better soon. The Bilkans chase the Shandia to the Upper Ruins. Enel smiles as his prophecy is about to come true. Wiper attacks Gan Fall. Nola attacks Wiper. Wiper shoots Nola with his bazooka, but it does not work. Ohm explains how his sword works to Zoro and then splits up with Holy to finish everyone off faster. Several Bilkans come to Ohm's aid while several Shandia come to Wiper's aid. Aisa and Nami appear on the Waver being chased by Bilkians and for a second Wiper and Zoro join forces, destroying the Bilkians. They then begin fighting again. Gan Fall and Pierre rescue Nami and Aisa from the fight only to be swallowed by Nola. Holy and Ohm attack Wiper and Zoro when their guard is down and both of them fall to the ground.\n\nLong Summary Edit\n\nAlong the northwestern shore of Upper Yard, Conis and Pagaya ponder how they will defend the Going Merry while waiting at the meeting spot Nami had previously designated. They ultimately decide to blow the horn from their dial boat to ward off any potential threats. Conis attends to the still injured Sanji and Usopp, while Pagaya silently hopes for everyone's safety in light of the perilous events that have gripped Sky Island. Throughout the forest, the ground is littered with all the Shandia and Enforcers of God's Army that have fallen over the course of the survival game, as they continue to wage war with one another. While the Shandia are still pushing to make it to the Giant Beanstalk, the Enforcers desperately regroup in order to repel them. Enel himself is enjoying the chaos, content that his prediction of the survival game is shaping up to come true.\n\nOn the beanstalk itself, the battle between Gan Fall, Zoro, Ohm, Wiper, and the Giant Snake continues to rage on. Wiper lands a direct hit to the snake with his Burn Bazooka, but is shocked that it is to no avail. The blow does still cause quite a bit of commotion inside the snake, sending Luffy toppling and causing him to wonder whats going on. Zoro grimaces in pain from a hit he took, as he rises to his feet. Ohm berates him for being a blue sea dweller that knows nothing, as he explains that his blade is actually the result of an iron cloud dial built into the hilt of the sword. It allows the blade to follow its target anywhere, which he then demonstrates by extending it all the way to Zoro from several meters away. Zoro blocks the attack with ease, commenting on the whip-like nature of the sword and how the warriors of the White Cloud Seas are like a bunch of circus performers.\n\nSensing new arrivals to the battlefield, Ohm tells Holy that they will now be splitting up. As predicted, both Shandia and God's Army Enforcers soon join them on the battlefield. The Shandia inform Wiper that they are the only ones left, and reaffirm their determination to help Wiper get to Enel. Inside the snake, Luffy decides to try to dig his way out, and begins clawing into the walls. In actuality he is tickling the snake, and the spectators are extremely confused to see the snake laughing hysterically. Just then, Nami and Aisa also burst through the clouds below as they continue riding up the beanstalk. The Enforcers attempt to chase them down, but are repelled by a combined effort from Zoro, Wiper, and Gan Fall. Zoro and Wiper ask Nami and Aisa respectively what they are doing here. As Nami asks Zoro where the others are, Wiper prepares a shot at Nami, wondering what she plans to do to Aisa. As he fires the blast, Gan Fall manages to get Nami and Aisa to safety aboard Pierre.

And he wrote in a book, Go, cast into the lake of fire.\"\n\n:the building of: the temple, consisting of two high walls, and within the temple there are two doors, one on the north and the other on the south. The Leviticus, Celsus, Chrysostom and some later Fathers hold this to be an institution of the reign of King Herod, and they attribute it to Moses the son of Aaron. Both he and his sister Theopompus worshipped God in the temple (J. of Jabne, \"epistle of Aaron to John,\" in Amos 14:27) and it was God's priests who imposed the blood-ritual upon the people.At the climax of the destruction in C. 133 the Prophet Abraham carried down all the graven images which the Gentiles had set up (and themselves placed above the door of the temple) and held them up as a sign of sacrifice to their Redeemer. It was the eschatological exigencies of the time which induced the Jewish Jews to rebuild the temple in its more primitive form, so that they could worship God and attend the sacred ceremony. The religious feeling of the Jews during this time forms a direct consequence of their captivity in Babylon, and its initial characteristics of opposition to the gentile world and hatred for the Jews and their enemies, are preserved to this day.\n\nPseudo-Origen (A.D. 170) records a very interesting tradition about the construction of the temple, repeating the words of St. Luke : From Jarrow to Thebes, \u2014 Take the nettles, and trample upon the pine trees, and destroy not the temple, which is the foundation and the crown of the household of God. The exact wording of this has been given elsewhere ; but it is of relevance to the subject.\n\nThe famous angel Gabriel, propitiatory in his service to God, descended at the sight of the erection of a garden in Jerusalem and was disturbed by the absence of the people, who were probably in hiding in the Temple compound ; and the following message from David to Bathsheba (in 1 Chr 2:1) proves that the community of Israel already numbered four thousand, of whom a good part were alive, and the inhabitants occupied the Temple and its adjoining buildings. The books of Josephus, which he claims to have quoted from his scribe, Flavius Josephus (\"Antiquities,\" xxiii. i.), all contain references to the fact of the construction of the temple by the priests for the service of the purpose of God. The period was, according to Josephus, from the time when Antiochus took Jerusalem (fifth century) : from that time to the tower of Babel, around five hundred years later : at which great crisis the Philistines tried to overthrow the city (fourth century). Lastly, R. Joshua ben Eliyses (r. 463) : the Jews say that the builders were assembled in Zera.\n\nJewish descent is still preserved through the spirit of Solomon, and through James the Elder who is concerned to establish the claims of the Jews, either in behalf of their overthrow of the Alexandrian government, or in behalf of their reunion with the maternal land, or on the supposition of a pericleso (Targum on Kings xxxi. 1 ). The original phrasing of his word, salvus, can best be interpreted as an enlarged denial of Christianity : \"We declare with you, as in the mirror, We are not of this world.\" (Jewish PS in Haqqi, 1911, VI, 422).\n\n\nVIII. SOME QUOTATIONS FROM BIBLE PARTS OR CLASSES:\n\nHosea (982) : \"Let the bricks and mortar be set to the foundation of the house of my God.\"\n\n(982) : \"Let the bricks and mortar be set to the foundation of the house of my God.\" Leviticus, An 29 : (7) \"That yoked I the ox to the ram, to tread the stony track, and that took the lead; for the oxen that tread the stony track are slow in treading it.\" (8) \"The donkey too, that sat down there under the bushel, was instructed concerning the rule of the cattle; it treads on its hoof to keep back the roar; it arched its back, and bound itself to its trainer to keep it slow.\" (9) \"Bruised, and bruised, and bruised again, yet the beast keeps the rule of the herd.\" (10) \"And when the sound of that great slaughter was done, and the roar was all gone out, the wolf (a wild animal,", "human": "ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION:\n\nTable of Contents \u2014In Rabbinical Literature:\n\nAn expression occurring in Matt. xxiv. 15 and Mark, xiii. 14 (A. V.), where the Greek text has \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b2\u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2. The Greek itself, however, is referable to a Hebrew expression, , found in Dan. ix. 27 (where the \u05dd of has been added, through a copyist's error, from the \u05de of the ensuing word); in Dan. xi. 31, and in Dan. xii. 11 (with omission of the prefixed \u05de).\n\nThe context of these passages leaves no room for doubt as to what was intended by this somewhat odd expression; namely, the transformation, by Antiochus Epiphanes, of the sacred Temple at Jerusalem into a heathen one. In both Biblical and rabbinical Hebrew abomination is a familiar term for an idol (I Kings, xi. 5; II Kings, xxiii. 13; Sifra, \u1e32edoshim, beginning, and Mekilta, Mishpatim, xx. ed. Weiss, 107), and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with Ezra, ix. 3, 4, \"motionless abomination\" or, also, \"appalling abomination.\" The suggestion of many scholars-Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others\u2014that , as a designation for Jupiter is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation \"Baal Shamem\" ( , \"lord of heaven\") is quite plausible, as is attested by the perversion of \"Beelzebub\" into \"\u0392\u03b5\u03b5\u03bb\u03b6\u03b5\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\" (Greek version) in Mark, iii. 22, as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli 'Ab. Zarah, 46a, that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form (see the examples quoted there). Though the expression \"Abomination of Desolation\" is accordingly recognizedin the light of this interpretation as a mistranslation of the phrase used in Daniel, there is no doubt that in the circles directly influenced by the Book of Daniel\u2014the same circles that originated the apocalyptic literature\u2014the expression was employed to designate an important eschatological conception. For it is only in an eschatological sense that the expression can be adequately explained in the New Testament passages above mentioned.\n\nAccording to most modern commentators, these passages are a Jewish apocalypse, somewhat tinged with Christianity, intended to prophesy the end of time, when the Antichrist, as the Abomination of Desolation, shall be enthroned as a ruler in God's Temple. The closely related \"smaller Apocalypse\" in II Thess. ii. 1-12 is a conclusive justification of this view; for it shows that neither the Romans (as Weiss in his commentary, ad loc., holds), nor the Zealots (Bleek, \"Synoptische Erkl\u00e4rung,\" and others), nor Caligula with his self-deification (Spitta, in his \"Offenbarung Johannis\") can be intended.\n\nThe rabbis as a whole consider that the expression refers to the desecration of the Temple by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts by Antiochus Epiphanes (see Apostemos ). Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who, as related in II Chron. xxxiii. 7, set up \"a carved image . . . in the house of God\" (Yer. Ta'anit, iv. 68a, and Rashi on the passage in Babli, ibid. 28b). The Haggadah narrates that two statues were erected, one of which fell over upon the other and broke off its hand. Upon the severed hand the following inscription was found engraved: \"I sought to destroy God's house, but Thou didst lend Thy hand to its protection\" (Ta'anit, 28b et seq.; compare Rabbinovicz, \"Vari\u00e6 Lectiones,\" on the passage for variant readings).\n\nBibliography: Compare modern commentators\u2014Meinhold, Bevan, Weiss, Prince\u2014upon the passages in Daniel and Matthew;\n\nalso Bousset, Der Antichrist, English translation, 1896, especially index;\n\nSpitta, Offenbarung Johannis, pp. 493-497;\n\nGr\u00e4tz, Gesch. d.

Championship Series London\n\n26-27 October, 2013\n\nImportant Information regarding Registration\n\nWhat happens at a Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series?\n\nYou can enjoy the excitement of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Championship Series at any live event; you just need to register for it. Registration for all events is free. Registration gets you entry into the event. There will be one GM cut, and top 8. You can increase your Entry Points by earning them over time in the tournament by increasing the power of your Rituals or by drawing cards from the top of your Deck. Once you've reached the right level of Entry Points, you can redeem your Entry Points on the website.\n\nWhy should you register?\n\nOnce you've registered, you'll be able to participate in singles and team teams. Teams compete in one-on-one and double elimination rounds of battle. Each player controls their own player characters in their Deck. When you lose a match, you lose all cards from your Deck to the Graveyard. (Your Deck is considered destroyed when you lose it all.) You can still draw cards from your Deck and you can attack with your characters if your opponent controls monsters, in some cases this is referred to as a \"boarding sequence\".\n\nCan I add more than one player per team?\n\nYou're allowed to have any number of players per team. In many cases, there is a prize boost at the end of a match depending on how many players you had. For example, if you have 7 players, you may win more than $100 in prizes for each opponent who doesn't win. Teams generally consist of 6 people.\n\nWhat Deck should I use?\n\nEach player starts with a Classic Deck. You may access that deck at any point during the Tournament. If you draw a Secret Rare from the deck, you must return it to the Deck Box.\n\nWhat card can I play during a particular match?\n\nAt a time, stop and look over all the cards in your Deck. (When you first set it up, you'll need to look over all the cards in it.) If you have any card(s) that can replace a card in your hand or Graveyard, you may use it to play that card. You can then put the rest of your cards face-down on the bottom of your Deck. This allows you to get rid of and replace cards that were discarded, to ensure that you bring your cards to Deck.\n\nWhy should I use Level 4 monsters?\n\nAt this level, your plays have very limited impact. When facing a monster that is Level 5 or above, your plays have limited impact. However, these monsters are significantly stronger than the monster of the same Level. Here are some examples:\n\nLevel 5\n\n3 Level 4s, 2 Level 3s, 4 Level 2s\n\nLevel 5\n\n3 Level 4s, 4 Level 3s, 5 Level 2s\n\nLevel 5\n\nLevel 4\n\n6 Level 3s, 8 Level 2s\n\nLevel 4\n\n8 Level 2s, 4 Level 1s\n\nLevel 5\n\n9 Level 2s, 6 Level 1s, 6 Level 0s\n\nLevel 5\n\n10 Level 2s, 8 Level 1s, 7 Level 0s\n\nPlay method:\n\nThe way I will approach the Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series\n\n5 players: It is standard practice to play the same Deck throughout the entire tournament. As such, the same Deck will always be used throughout all, if not all, of the event matches.\n\n4 players: Playing several games before a match is not unusual. People just want to learn the game, and it is extremely common to prepare the Deck as a \"Practice deck\". As such, we will test the Deck as soon as we complete the tournament matches. You could hold a \"practice\" Booster Draft before the tournament.\n\n3 players: It is normal to start a series of 1 vs 1 matches as soon as you wrap up your Deck drafting. We sometimes also use 1 vs 1 drafts just before the tournament to help keep people interested in the game. You could even play this strategy with the classic Rares. For example, if you played this strategy in Last Stand you could use the Rares like Tezcatlipoca's Space Scarab is Artifact and Gateway to stop the monsters' effects from applying.\n\n2 players: It is normal for people who are practicing to set up their Deck ahead of time.\n\n1 player: Holding one of the different record decks may help you practice. We do not set this strategy up for team play.\n\n2 players: We do not generally set up the record decks for teams. This allows everyone to practice before taking on their own 2nd team (assuming there is one person for each team). Sometimes, people may want to practice different records in distinct matches as", "human": "Yu-Gi-Oh!

Now he and his new teammates will battle the Timberwolves for that Central Division crown. The Los Angeles Lakers could make it five victories in a row for the first time since getting within single digits of the lowly Timberwolves on Feb. 11 as they seek their first franchise-record 51st win. Gay, who finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds after missing two games to rest an ailing right foot, is expected to play Wednesday. Bryant, meanwhile, is expected to miss his second straight game with a sore right ankle. It was the third straight game he saw fewer than 20 minutes as the Lakers scored 101 points in a 119-86 rout of the Hornets on Monday. Bryant averaged 22.7 points - his highest total since 2011-12 - but struggled in his second game back from a strained left hamstring which first limited him in March. \"We didn't take full advantage of my minutes,\" Bryant told the team's official website. \"We weren't productive or efficient. I'm still taking care of the ends and not getting caught up in the means. It's just part of the game, like it was yesterday. Today, we can take care of the means.\" The Lakers shot a season-low 38.8 percent and didn't come close to reaching 100 points. They went 15 of 52 (31.3 percent). Los Angeles (50-21) was led by Anthony Carter (13 points) and Jordan Hill (11) with Steve Nash (10) sharing 10 points to lead the way. Jordan Crawford hit a driving layup to give Minnesota (31-30), still in the hunt for a second straight playoff berth, a 70-69 lead with 6:04 remaining and didn't fall short again. \"Both teams out made shots, made plays,\" said Pierce, who scored 15 points while going 8 for 16 from the field. \"I think a lot of it's going to come down to what they play from shot to shot and what they have on the offensive end.\" Gay struggled in his return, going 1 for 10, after he averaged 18.8 points in the first three games. He had his streak snapped with 14 points in a 118-94 home loss to the Heat on Nov. 20. \"I had a great shooting night but I was back to back turnovers and easy baskets,\" Gay said. \"I'm still real sorry about that and I know that was not in the plans but there's so much of the offseason that's out of my hands that I shouldn't have had to deal with it.\" There's still plenty of room to improve on the court, as Minnesota had won two of three before losing in overtime to the Clippers. Both teams were outscored 30-1 in the third quarter. The Timberwolves have beaten the Lakers twice this season - 134-113 in the first meeting on Nov. 13 - and that was without leading scorer Karl-Anthony Towns, who is out for a month with a bruised right knee. Two days after facing his former team, veteran forward Kevin Garnett poured in a career-high 54 points on 18-of-24 from the field and all five of his 3-pointers. Gerald Wallace also had a team-high 15 rebounds, but Minnesota didn't quite pull off the upset. \"It's not over,\" head coach Rick Adelman said. \"It's never over, so it's very, very important.\" Minnesota will play its next three games at home. The Timberwolves, though, are looking for their first five-game winning streak since they won 10 last season. They also didn't give up a scoring lead in all three games but held Bryant to 23.9 percent shooting. He was 0 for 5 from 3-point range with 14 points in his return from a groin injury. Love, who broke out of a season-worst nine-game run of 22 points or fewer in Wednesday's win, wasn't shy in describing the big win as \"historic.\" \"I hadn't ever felt that before. At least I don't think I have,\" Love told the Timberwolves website. \"It was amazing. I mean, I hadn't felt that before. Everybody was talking about other teams. My boy loves me, but the Lakers are back and all the attention that was on us was on them and they're no longer here.\" The Lakers shot 55.3 percent and outrebounded the Timberwolves 55-39, though their offense didn't go beyond 48 points. The Timberwolves were also outscored 50-32 in the first quarter while playing without four starters. \"We have four guys that can still shoot 3's so it was nice. We could have done a lot better and got a little luck out of it to get that out of our offense,\" coach Rick Adelman told the team's official website. \"We're not really", "topp": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nLakers-Timberwolves Preview\n\nBy ALAN FERGUSON\n\nPosted Jan 29 2012 1:13AM It's been nearly four months since Rudy Gay went down and Kobe Bryant rebuilt his front court. Now he and his new teammates will battle the Timberwolves for that Central Division crown. The Los Angeles Lakers could make it five victories in a row for the first time since getting within single digits of the lowly Timberwolves on Feb. 11-12. There's still plenty to work out for Bryant and the Lakers, though. Minnesota (12-26) will try to continue its dominance over its suddenly weak Southeast Division against a Lakers squad resting six of its top nine players. Minnesota will be without the league's leading scorer, Kevin Love, at the morning shootaround because of a sore right elbow. Love missed Friday's 98-82 home loss to the Lakers due to a toe injury, but the point guard has been practicing and will be available if needed. \"Any time you get injured, it's difficult but it's part of the game of basketball,\" Love said. \"When you look at the schedule, you look at whether it will be easy or tough or long. I'm just taking one day at a time. You just have to keep your head down, stay focused and play defense, like everyone wants to do. We have to play together for a long time.\" No one is sure yet if Bryant will be able to play in this matchup. He's eligible to be restricted free agency after this season and the one-year contract he signed in September prompted a report that he'd consider drawing back the curtain on his career in Los Angeles. \"I don't think it will impact what we are going to do on the court,\" Bryant said. \"No, we just have to play the right way and make sure we keep the same belief in ourselves and keep the same mentality. If (we're) going to do it then we have to do it every day and when it's time to do it, it's going to be done.\" With Love out, rookie point guard Ricky Rubio has quickly and impressively established himself as an elite defensive specialist. Rubio has scored a career-high 41 points in three games, and he has led Minnesota to a 2-0 record without Love and Bryant. \"He has been playing really well,\" Timberwolves coach Rick Adelman said. \"He's not being asked much so he's picking and choosing when to be there. He's getting to the next level.\" It should be a close matchup, especially for Rubio because opponents generally are more willing to use small lineups when healthy. \"When they have some bodies that can shoot the ball, they're very difficult to guard,\" Minnesota's Kevin Martin said. The Lakers also have it tougher because it's difficult for them to switch on defense because of their need to create their own shots. In this most recent matchup, the Lakers were outscored 29-20 and committed 16 turnovers, turning a four-point lead into a nine-point deficit. Los Angeles' journeyman center Andrew Bynum is expected to miss at least another week with a sprained right ankle. Bynum has played in three of the last four games with a sore right ankle and left the Lakers on Wednesday without struggling power forward Metta World Peace, who's out for a second straight game because of a stress reaction in his left knee. World Peace didn't practice Friday and was listed as day to day Saturday. Bynum averages 6.8 points and 8.1 rebounds, while World Peace is averaging 1.2 points and 3.0 rebounds. \"It's just not our year right now,\" Bryant said. \"It's not not going to be the same level of effort we had, the basketball we had to play with to get a win. It's a grind-it-out league. We have to battle the best teams.\" It's a grind Bryant has attempted to describe more times than he can count in recent years. After Bryant's shot \"flopped\" in Friday's loss to Phoenix, the Lakers' Jermaine O'Neal bragged about how Bryant hadn't ever flinched. Los Angeles was also outrebounded by 28 in Thursday night's 122-89 loss at Cleveland. \"Jermaine ran the point the first couple years in the Western Conference, now he runs the point the way the Lakers run it,\" Thomas Bryant said. \"He's old school. He doesn't care about what everyone else thinks of him. He's going to do his job. That's all I've heard from Jermaine -- that he's not a pawn in whatever triangle he's in and he does his job. He's usually a pretty good winner, so we've got to look out for him and respect his game.\" Bryant, meanwhile, appeared determined to continue his strong play with an injury to former Laker Paul Silas that went undetected until it slowed him down in the fourth quarter. Bryant said that", "human": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nLakers-Timberwolves Preview\n\nBy ALAN FERGUSON\n\nPosted Jan 29 2012 1:13AM It's been nearly five years since the Minnesota Timberwolves have had a chance at a .500 record this late into a season. However, it's also been almost as long since they've beaten their next opponent. The Timberwolves will attempt to snap a 15-game skid to the Los Angeles Lakers by taking advantage of their struggles on the road Sunday night. For the third time this season, Minnesota (9-10) is close to evening its record. In the most recent attempt, the Timberwolves were 7-8 before a 108-98 loss at Utah on Jan. 21 but have gotten another chance after two wins over teams from the Lone Star State. After a 105-90 victory in Dallas on Wednesday, they topped San Antonio 87-79 on Friday when Ricky Rubio scored nine of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Kevin Love also had 18 points in his first home game after signing a four-year extension worth more than $60 million, and was one of three Minnesota players to record double-doubles along with Rubio and center Nikola Pekovic. \"It's a terrific win for our guys,\" coach Rick Adelman said. \"Hopefully it's really a step forward for us.\" Minnesota will try to use take another step by improving to .500 after 20 games for the first time since it was 22-22 on Jan. 30, 2007, and by beating the Lakers for the first time since March 6, 2007. The 15 consecutive losses to Los Angeles (11-9) since that 117-107 double overtime victory at home is the league's second-longest active losing streak to one opponent. Minnesota has dropped 16 in a row to Northwest Division rival Portland. The Timberwolves, though, might have one of their best chances to snap that skid as the Lakers are 1-7 away from home. They opened a road-heavy stretch Saturday with a 100-89 loss in Milwaukee. A Kobe Bryant jumper put Los Angeles within four points of the Bucks with 4:52 remaining, but Milwaukee responded with a 15-4 run. The Lakers, who are playing seven of their next eight on the road, are off to their worst start on the road since dropping eight of their first nine in 2002-03. They're also seeking to avoid their first five-game road losing streak since March 4-15, 2007. \"There's concern and determination that we want to fix things. If we solve that issue, then we'll be all right,\" Bryant said after his team lost for the fourth time in five games overall. Los Angeles can help itself by scoring 100 or more points for the first time in 14 games. The Lakers, winners of seven in a row at the Target Center, haven't surpassed 96 in any of their eight road contests. They're averaging 89.6 points away from home but have topped the century mark in seven of their last nine in Minnesota. This time, though, Los Angeles will face a Timberwolves team that's made impressive strides defensively in its first season under Adelman. Minnesota is allowing 93.5 points per game after giving a league-worst 107.7 per contest in 2010-11. The Timberwolves, though, could use more help from Love against the Lakers. The California native has averaged 12.2 points in 11 all-time matchups, his lowest against a Western Conference opponent. He's averaged 10.0 points on 33.3 percent shooting in five home games and had one of two scoreless starts in his career during a 112-95 loss Nov. 19, 2010. Bryant, who broke Jerry West's franchise record for free throws made Saturday, is four field goals shy of surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team mark of 9,935.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

People don't like to provide; breeding opportunities are proactively discouraged, and throughout this world of bureaucratic obstacle, there are always and only a handful of people who are committed to rescuing companion animals. One, the Humane Society, provides birds. It's the only rescue group that will \"post\" wildlife and sell them for adoption. The animals are great animals and deserve a home but their \"market\" is completely reliant on people who want to adopt, so the adoption prices are generally thrown out for market research. The other group I've seen is The Wildlife Society, a per-unit process which is terrible. The birds are most likely euthanized, the pets're ignored for a few weeks, and then you get back to good ol' normal by rescues making big bucks by demanding the pet is simply handed off to someone who may have considered adopting if you'd allowed them to live! In my experience, this is the \"knock on the door\" message, and it happens about 2-3 times a day. Call a veteran guy at an urban animal rescue group. They're willing to talk about rehoming your new friend. I'm pretty sure they can hand over your friend at a time of their choosing. If you need someone in San Diego to show you how to rehome a bird, and they're not a vet, that's totally fine. And there are plenty of retail locations in San Diego that sell used companion birds. It's a crap shoot as to how many flying animals you can get for one pet \u2013 keep in mind that our most famous pack of flying birds, the white-tailed eagle, had only 23 chicks! There's also a basic topic here, multiple-species adoption. This is a pretty simple matter of \"I have access to my investment\", and that probably means that other people can do it, but, seriously, people really don't consider this \"revealing\" to anyone other than one swoop swoop, and the internet is replete with folks who've come to this conclusion in a moment of panic (\"Look the flocking! Look the flocking!\").\n\nThe ecological advantages of complex predation systems render false the supernatural \"every creature is tasty/kosher/suitable\" philosophy that routinely reinforces the red-tape web of confusion around the killing of companion animals. I don't know of a single case where a dew skier or two is killed by an elk \u2013 or even a bear, which most Americans have imbibed at the pretty close range of a mammalian carcass. Bear hunting is done all over the country, and usually, the hunted animal is an ungulate that can't be hunted for its meat, bone, fat, or gill. There are a number of reasons why an animal can't be hunted. Take for example any of the numerous and laudable alternative diets for herbivores that conventional nutritionists just love to point out are terrible for the animal: jellyfish, mussels, brine shrimp, crawfish, etc. (Actually, venison is a very good alternative.) You put in a 2- to 4-pound slab of high quality meat from a wild animal, then eat it. You suck fat from the smaller animals and take the meat out and eat it, then you realize when the meat runs out that nothing can really go back into your gut. If the problem was that ungulates don't eat pork or beef, then the rules would have to be changed at some point so that duck or venison could be flown down and eaten. It's been changed. That assumes that the animal was not in a pasture situation \u2013 not a \"quagmire\" situation. Eggs and roe from rabbit and goose or pigs can travel for miles along tall brush in winter and spring, after which sunlight from early morning shrinks them. The thinner and less protein rich the animal, the farther the animals are going. Those (mostly hogs and deer) who eat apple orchards can survive pretty well on low-quality protein.

The agency filed the rule Wednesday, April 1, 2009, a day ahead of Thursday's publication of the delisting in the Federal Register. (AP Photo/Dawn Villella, file) (Photo: Dawn Villella, AP) Story Highlights Current Michigan law would allow for a wolf hunt in 2015.\n\nProposals 14-1 and 14-2 will have no authority unless current law overturned via legal challenges.\n\nThere will be no Michigan wolf hunt in 2014.\n\nMichigan voters who care whether the state should allow wolf hunting can have their say next week on the general election ballot.\n\nSort of.\n\nTwo proposals are on the Nov. 4 ballot that would either allow or prohibit state officials from holding another public hunting season for wolves. However, both proposals are essentially null and void -- regardless of how Michiganders vote on them -- because of action taken by the Legislature over the summer.\n\nAdvocates on both sides of the issue want voters to have their say because the proposals could become important in the future.\n\nThe proposals are the result of a complicated political chess match between those who oppose public wolf hunting and those who think it's an important tool for managing the former endangered species.\n\nTo help you understand what you're voting on, we talked to the non-partisan Citizens Research Council to put together a primer on both proposals and why they may not matter until the future.\n\nThe history\n\nFirst, Wolves are native to Michigan but were nearly wiped out in the 19th and early 20th centuries by hunting and state-sanctioned bounties.\n\nIn 1973, when Congress created the federal endangered species list, only six wolves were known to still exist in the Michigan wild.\n\nUnder federal protection, wolf recovery was slow. But starting in 1989, the numbers began to rise in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, along with the hope that one day the animals would rebound enough to return to state control.\n\nTo prepare for that possibility, the state convened a task force in 2005 to create a wolf management plan. Members of the task force included all stakeholders in wolf management, including biologists, representatives of Michigan's Indian tribes, sporting groups and wolf advocates.\n\nAn overview of wolves in Michigan\n\nBy 2007, the wolf population in the Upper Peninsula topped 500 -- far exceeding the recovery benchmark of 100 set by the federal government, making the Great Lakes gray wolf one of the most successful recovery stories in the history of the endangered species list.\n\nAt the same time, however, some Upper Peninsula residents began to complain that wolves were edging too close for comfort. Some farmers reported that wolves were killing livestock, and U.P. citizens reported wolves encroaching on towns and yards.\n\nIn 2007, U.S. Fish and Wildlife sought to remove Great Lakes gray wolves from federal protection, but the Humane Society of the United States sued to delay the move. A federal court ruled in favor of the Humane Society, and wolves remained under endangered species protection for several more years.\n\nFinally, in 2012, Great Lakes gray wolves were removed from the endangered species list, putting the state of Michigan back in control of its wolf population.\n\nThe conversation - or the debate\n\nMichigan's wolf management plan highlighted several methods for controlling the wolf population once they were removed from the endangered species list, including a potential public wolf hunt.\n\nRead the wolf management plan\n\nIn December 2012, less than a year after wolves were removed from the list, the Legislature passed a bill designating wolves game animals. It was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder and became Public Act 520.\n\nThe new law cleared the way for the Natural Resources Commission -- a seven-member body appointed by the governor -- to establish a hunting season for wolves.\n\nProponents, including the state Department of Natural Resources, cited several reasons for backing wolf hunts. The DNR told lawmakers at a hearing that hunting would be one of many tools used by wildlife officials to control the wolf population.\n\n\"While the wolf population offers benefits, it also poses significant costs and concerns to some Michigan residents,\" Trevor VanDyke, the DNR's legislative liaison, told a Senate committee. \"This would be another tool that would allow for proper management and implementation of the wolf management plan, and we think we'd use this as a tool to reduce those negative impacts and conflicts with livestock and humans.\"\n\nOpponents believed it was too soon to talk about a hunt. At the same hearing, wolf advocate Nancy Warren of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition questioned the scientific need for hunting as a management tool.\n\n\"There is no scientific evidence or research to support the need for", "eta_suffix": " area of the Wolf Pack in Tupper Lake State Park in DuPage, Wis.

{"eta": "[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends and misinformation surrounding its authenticity. I mean, it's completely fake, it's totally a fabrication, and it's more than a little bit ridiculous. So here's my attempt to set the record straight...\n\nThe Morbid Anatomy Center of the University of Wisconsin at Madison\n\nRemember the fake Anatomy Center? Well, it's a real location. In 2010, in a book titled Medical Credibility and Academic Integrity: Med Schools, Academic Journals, and the Rise of High Fliers (pdf), Robert Stintz and a team of professors and students documented, in detail, over 50 academic case studies concerning the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee School of Medicine and Anatomy. The story: Between 1,000 and 2,000 physicians and surgeons work at the university, and it's maintained by a small but strong administrative community of 8,500 faculty. To keep up with this number, it was a natural for a variety of researchers to flock to the school, from academics, from medical schools, from private practice, from foundations, from NGOs, from non-profit organizations, and, as we shall see, from the government itself.\n\nIn Stintz's analysis, for example, a 2003 study of 75 medical school graduates showed they were 93.7 percent likely to agree that \"the most common reason to relocate after graduation is to improve the quality of patient care\u2026especially when considering which area of medicine is most interested in a new hire.\" And another study he referenced showed that a doctor with a neuroscience degree was 88 percent likely to be able to take a patient who wasn't on medical insurance.\n\nMoreover, the folks in charge of student affairs were persistent; \"only 9.2 percent complained about being treated in a poor light. Among students with no administrative experience, the percentage increased to 14.3 percent,\" Stintz found. Here are the numbers in his piece:\n\nQuality of patient care is as important to the med school as demographics. At the University of Wisconsin, Northwestern and University of Washington, there is a good chance that all that happens in medical school is recorded on paper in advance of the event. Not a lot of research comes out for the median quartile student: Undergraduate medical students interviewed by Stintz predicted they had better odds of getting good patient care than they had of getting good wages. These students ranked themselves higher than their classmates because they were more confident they would be treated fairly and preferred to be evaluated with care rather than a scorecard. They said that patient care was second to education, and they tended to compare their lives to someone else's: \"If I'm doing well and I'm being treated well, great. If I'm not doing well and I'm being treated poorly, the world needs to know the two of us are screwed up.\"\n\nOne doctor who had been to two medical schools told Stintz: \"No one asks about your instructor. This is the most gender-neutral space you will ever go to.\" So what's all the fuss about? According to Stintz's preliminary analysis, the most cited reason for migrating to the school was the rigor of the clinical education--the rigor that requires 10 years of instruction before students get an MD and make their way to residency. If you do it right, you can still graduate midcareer and have good patient care. Plus, it's the first place you could hope to secure a job and live with independence if you need medical care in the future. As he summarized, \"The students give up three months work at a time as an expectation rather than a requirement.\"\n\nThe most cited reason for migrating to the school was the structure. \"They assume that teaching in a large university where faculty work together equals the highest level of academic standard,\" Stintz found. \"They assume that hiring committees are not interested in how many additional months do you need to master a certain discipline. They, too, have a hand in that. Some faculty members expect job security in a state university. Other faculty members expect academic independence and flexibility like this very structure.\"\n\nStudents also often imagine that \"when you get a teaching job, you're putting yourself out in this big galaxy of doctors which is like Babylon. The truth is that you're graduating in this much more isolated place, in a city where your peers are like no other people in the world.\" And student privileges are encouraged:\n\nDiscipline was cited by many as being the main reason for students to move into this high-profile academic setting. At best, the administration was seen as overly-cautious and unsupportive. At worst, it was a literal disconnect from a much more common institution, much more emotionally resistant to outsiders. Students find that because their discipline is viewed as academic, they are more likely to find themselves outside the norm.

I mean, it's completely fake, it's totally inflatable, and it's more than a little bit dangerous. Now the company seems to have gone back on its word; it looks like they finally finally realized what the blow-ups were but apparently they need to be retaken. Wanting to get me a confirmation they've fallen off the map, I reached out to the Welsh branch. Their office is on Robert Street in London. I say \"on\" for the sake of emphasis, as this photo is from when it was running in March. In response to my email, Ian McMillan, National Sales Manager of Battenfeld, Wales, replied (this is a 10 page email, but you're here for the grammar stuff, not the email): Hi Col, You have a friend to thank for your advice about swirly paper balls. He was a regular visitor of the item. He now works as head of HR for Bowbrick Coal. He was introduced to the product through Jim Boxall, Studio Canvas. Jim mentioned that, as a younger lad, he once played with a mate on the front lawn while playing football. After giving the man a poke, he must have realized that something was out of place. \"Well, Steve,\" he said, \"I reckon it's a bit of a gamble taking it on my next visit. Most of us use it for cartoons, and a regular ball won't turn up for another six months or so.\" Well, Steve, thanks for your accurate info about the bands changing it. I'm amazed at the amount of drummers who walked away in disgust. It does seem to be associated with avant-garde shows and bands in particular. I recently saw it at the Winterplace raves [Los Angeles, CA; Summerbury NY; August 6 -10, 1998]. I liked it but was disappointed that they didn't take as many spectators. Seems like a pretty conservative venue. Love your site, and I hope that you continue to expand it. It's looking to be a tough go. Cheers Chris Cox 2009 Thanks Col For the valuable info on swirly balls: Yes, this is 100% real. It is inflatable and extra heavy, but there is no slip under it (and it has the features of a bandstand, as per the La Guardia bandstand balls). If you want to be in a creative mood, you can spin it towards your ear and it will be very audible and low on the noise meter, as opposed to the 3 oz ball that I have on my desk right now. They are actually mass manufactured as licensed experiment tape re-uses (well, if that's the legal term) by the Libra Machines Corporation. In fact they claim to be the first and oldest television device ever made. The libra machines! That's going to work out well. The reggae artists also love to inflate the swirly balls. I think the cable TV repeats of those shows ruined it for them (you know I am a Biffy Clyro fan!) It has to be the essence of a joke to watch some dorks grinning from ear to ear as the paces of chaos erupt and make them laugh. When they are doing that it has to be in my opinion the most high energy bait has ever made its appearance. They can't possibly get away with that. I see it as a challenge to the need for real-life maniacs to really get on with the show. I also think you're right about the drums dropping out occasionally. It is the primordial angst that seems to culminate (and will with time) in the end of a vocalist's set. On Tijuana it might have happened in a similar way (no, I'm not talking about Raquel, it's just me jesting about your best mates' Kookaburra or, probably better, the lovely Kay Boyle!), although alas, good job without a good old-fashioned cover from 'The Big Breakfast' on the subject. But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let's get back to Swirly Balls for one more time, shall we? You're missing the mark. The truth is that all of this monkey business is more entertaining for the other members of the band that are inevitably noisily screaming the same cheesy tune over and over again, that's the show. It's less entertaining for the other members of the band who are consistently coming across like a vocal salad from a Julie Burchill opus to my ear. And you aren't the only one who thought I was a Luddite, you're the only one I'm going to send comments about. Plus this is 2010, David, and I'm not going to stop hating \"live bands\" for their obvious lack of meaning,", "human": "[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends and myths on wireless LAN security. Every time I write an article or blog on wireless LAN security, someone has to come along and regurgitate one of these myths. If that weren't bad enough, many \"so called\" security experts propagated these myths through speaking engagements and publications and many continue to this day. Many wireless LAN equipment makers continue to recommend many of these schemes to this day. One would think that the fact that none of these schemes made it in to the official IEEE 802.11i security standard would give a clue to their effectiveness, but time and time again that theory is proven wrong. To help you avoid the these schemes, I've created the following list of the six dumbest ways to secure your wireless LAN.\n\nWireless LAN security hall of shame\n\nMAC filtering: This is like handing a security guard a pad of paper with a list of names. Then when someone comes up to the door and wants entry, the security guard looks at the person's name tag and compares it to his list of names and determines whether to open the door or not. Do you see a problem here? All someone needs to do is watch an authorized person go in and forge a name tag with that person's name. The comparison to a wireless LAN here is that the name tag is the MAC address. The MAC address is just a 12 digit long HEX number that can be viewed in clear text with a sniffer. A sniffer to a hacker is like a hammer to a carpenter except the sniffer is free. Once the MAC address is seen in the clear, it takes about 10 seconds to cut-paste a legitimate MAC address in to the wireless Ethernet adapter settings and the whole scheme is defeated. MAC filtering is absolutely worthless since it is one of the easiest schemes to attack. The shocking thing is that so many large organizations still waste the time to implement these things. The bottom line is, MAC filtering takes the most effort to manage with zero ROI (return on investment) in terms of security gain.\n\nSSID hiding: There is no such thing as \"SSID hiding\". You're only hiding SSID beaconing on the Access Point. There are 4 other mechanisms that also broadcast the SSID over the 2.4 or 5 GHz spectrum. The 4 mechanisms are; probe requests, probe responses, association requests, and re-association requests. Essentially, youre talking about hiding 1 of 5 SSID broadcast mechanisms. Nothing is hidden and all youve achieved is cause problems for Wi-Fi roaming when a client jumps from AP to AP. Hidden SSIDs also makes wireless LANs less user friendly. You dont need to take my word for it. Just ask Robert Moskowitz who is the Senior Technical Director of ICSA Labs in his white paper Debunking the myth of SSID hiding.\n\nLEAP authentication: The use of Cisco LEAP authentication continues to be the single biggest mistake that corporations make with their wireless LAN because they leave themselves wide open to attack. Cisco still tells their customers that LEAP is fine so long as strong passwords are used. The problem is that strong passwords are an impossibility for humans to deal with. If you doubt this, try a password audit of all the users in your organization and see how long it takes to crack 99% of all passwords. 99% of organizations will flunk any password audit for most of their users within hours. Any attempt to enforce strong passwords will result in passwords written on sticky notes. Since Joshua Wright released a toolthat can crackLEAP with lighting speed, Cisco was forced to come out with a better alternative to LEAP and they came up with an upgradeto LEAP calledEAP-FAST. Unfortunately, EAP-FAST still falls short in security with its default installation. Although Cisco makes LEAP and EAP-FAST freely available to partners for the client end, the same is not true for Access Points.LEAP and EAP-FAST are essentially two proprietary protocolsthat Cisco employs as a strategy to monopolize the Access Point market. There are open standards based EAP mechanisms like EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP which are all much more secure than either LEAP or EAP-FAST and they work on all Access Points and client adapters, not just Cisco. Cisco does support open standard EAPs just like everyone else so you should always use open EAP standards to get better security and avoid the hardware lock-in.\n\nDisable DHCP: This is much more of waste of time than it is a security break. DHCP allows the automatic assignment of IP addresses and other configurations. Disabling DHCP has zero security value and just wastes time. It would take a hacker about 10 seconds to figure out the IP scheme of any network and simply assign their own IP address. Anyone who tells you that", "eta_suffix": " academic setting.

I went through too many Christmas programs and wondered what happened when Christmas was over.. What I finally felt on Thursday after the League finished was sadness.

The sadness is only coming now.Valley Lore is here once again. I am playing a Mormon Ghost Trapped Puzzle, the kind you see in these same materials. This one is slightly less crazy than the original.Oh, by the way, I think there is a clone that belongs to Keith, but we didn't want to mention it so close to Halloween.The other owner of Valley Lore is Smith-Henning, one of the power players and that is all I am going to say about him!This is the least creepy or gruesome monster I have ever made!

Watch their beautiful wedding video here:vimeo.com/112371211We are fundraising money, because Anthony is not working anymore & is taking care of his health & spending time with family full time. On average, ALS patient care can be upwards of $200K a year. Although Anthony is currently not at that point of dependency, ALS only gets worse & is a progressive disease...we know it too well. This is why we're attempting to prepare for a financially stress free life.Anthony will ultimately need a wheelchair accessible home... he will need help paying for health insurance, future medical expenses, food, phone, car, rent, basic living costs... etc and hopefully a little room to enjoy his healthier years...We sincerely appreciate any and all support. We love each and every one of you!

He radiates joy, love and compassion. He loves to laugh, takes the most gorgeous photographs, has mad skateboarding skills, plays the acoustic guitar and is an artist at heart. He is LOVED by all, and he is a miraculous gift to our family and everyone else who knows him.On Monday, January 27th, Anthony received the devastating news that he has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS runs in the family. His grandmother died from it, and his mother currently has it. Ironically, Anthony had been helping to take care of his mother and is a dedicated advocate and voice in the fight to cure ALS when this all happened. In his own words:\"During the past six months, my hands became noticeably weaker, and both arms began twitching constantly. My last few weddings, I had difficulties changing my camera settings, because my hands were so weak. I tried to convince myself it was carpal tunnel, even though I knew these were the same symptoms my mother and grandmother experienced before they were diagnosed with ALS. I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after.\"To attempt to preserve the muscle that's left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it. He is liquidating his camera equipment to raise funds to pay for his medical insurance and costs, as well as his business expenses and taxes that he currently owes, but it will not be enough since he can no longer work... So, we are fundraising for him. All contributions go directly into Anthony's PayPal account, and you do not need a PayPal account to contribute. When the payment request comes up, you have the option to use PayPal or credit card.Share & contribute through this website. - or \u2013Mail a check to his address:31915 Rancho California Road, Suite 200-400, Temecula CA, 92591Spread the word about ALS and/or pray for him.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

{"eta": "Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendment\n\nby Rick Moen\n\nAugust 25, 2008\n\n(last updated August 6, 2018)\n\nThis past century has seen California's 1st Amendment, which outlines the guarantee of a free and open election process for people to participate in, and the way in which the ballot initiative process usually proceeds. That was done until 1938.\n\nThere are several things going in the right and the wrong direction:\n\nSupporters of AB60 continue to approach politicians and local governments with the ultimate goal of putting the measure on the ballot. The success of those approaches depends a great deal on whether the electorate believes an initiative will pass, and the political incentives that would motivate people to vote to put the measure on the ballot. According to a public campaign finance analysis conducted by the Campaign Legal Center (CLC) and the Center for Competitive Politics (CCP), by highlighting the benefits of the initiative process the campaign may encourage more people to vote to put the measure on the ballot and thereby lower the chances the measure does not receive a majority. Thus, California's initiative process is being targeted for voter suppression in 2013 through AB60, which will provide one of the many false victories the initiative process for passage has been getting.\n\nAB60 has a potential appeal as a status quo measure, even if it is not an approved constitutional amendment which would still prevail in a successful, referendums or elections. If it is vetoed by the legislature, then it will go into effect as soon as it is adopted by the legislature, which is now scheduled for next January.\n\nA \"yes\" vote on the initiative allows the governor, and other officials, to nullify or bypass federal laws that cannot be seen as federal laws at all.\n\nAB60 would provide the major political base of Prop 23, which advocates hope will provide the funds needed to retain the higher wages and jobs California benefits of Prop 23 but would put the state back of its fiscal affairs if it is repealed. This is despite the fact that almost all other states with similar measures already have a similar provision that prevents or suspends benefits for those who are deported.\n\nBy causing AB60 to fail, the Republican leadership of California's Legislature and the Republican Governor have given Prop 23 a better chance of success, even though the situation is a major reason why California has the lowest voter turnout in the country. California has three pieces of legislation that will ultimately reach the ballot, and all three would make AB60 a winnable ballot measure, as it would cover millions more Americans than the Prop 23 proposal.\n\nIn December of 1995, California voters rejected the Prenatal Care Insurance Reform Act (\"FCIR\"). Sponsored by Senators and Assemblymen Gordon Smith, and Frank \"Fat Frank\" Nock, the FCIR proposed \"abatement of the cost of prenatal care coverage.\" It will cost the state in excess of $200 billion per year to insure Californians when compared to the current implementation of Prop 23. If AB60 were enacted, it would bring California into compliance with the FCIR by requiring insurers to pay what they estimate is a savings of more than $10 billion annually - without allowing insurance companies (individuals or businesses) to transfer anyone else out of the individual market.\n\nIn January of 2005, Proposition 21 was the last attempt to prevent California's version of Florida's \"right to work\" law from being enacted. It is widely recognized by everyone who has read it that Prop 21 was a costly failure that did not achieve its intended effect. Supporters of Prop 21 repeatedly said it would help the poorer Californians and family farmers who benefit from Prop 23's higher wages. Even other political figures were quoted as saying it would make sure that low and middle income citizens were kept out of medical coverage.\n\nBut by failing to reach its stated purpose of preventing employers from not having to provide coverage, Prop 21 did not prevent employers from introducing their own skimpy health plans, even though it did not require the insurers to do the same. Those so-called \"exemptions\" may have been generated out of thin air while the employer didn't like those \"exemptions.\" In a recent lawsuit charging this being unlawful, the state's attorney general even considered using the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act to sue a conservative Christian school, saying if that school refused to hire a transgender boy, it would use a medical exemption, the kind that would be used to sue a nonprofit health care facility for not covering contraception, even though it does not have to do so.\n\nIn January 2007, Attorney General Kamala Harris' (D) reelection campaign claimed her win against then-Congresswoman Barbara Boxer (D) in one of the most expensive congressional elections ever. It is estimated that Senate Candidate Harris spent $60 million on television ads, mailings and direct mail.\n\nProp 45 gives teachers a 2.5% raise from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010.\n\nProp 46 gives the California Toll Bridge Authority (\"CTBA\")", "topp": "Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendment\n\nby Rick Moen\n\nAugust 25, 2008\n\n(last updated August 6, 2018)\n\nThis past century has seen California's 1st Amendment, which outlines the guarantee of a free and open election process for people to participate in, and the way in which the ballot initiative process usually proceeds. That was done until 1938.\n\nThere are several things going on in the and the California Marriage Amendment.\n\nThe first of those being gay politicians fighting on two fronts.\n\nPro-gay politicians on the right doing all they can to conflate traditional marriage, with laws which defend the natural definition of marriage, and the prohibition of such laws in California.\n\nOn the left, gay politicians fighting on two fronts\u2014on allowing traditional marriage to stand, but at the same time supporting the passage of a proposed amendment. I believe they understand that they can't have it both ways: if they're pro-equality, and they get on the \"the campaign trail\" trying to force traditional marriage on gays and lesbians, that means the end of marriage, and it means that they have lost.\n\nThe second of those being gay proponents of gay marriage, arguing for passage as well. These aren't liberals running into a brick wall. They aren't minorities who want to make life less difficult for everybody. Rather, these are publicly influential people, such as the New York Times, Jonathan Kay, Mark Salter, and Peter Gabriel, telling us as valid as it is, that the marriage is too precious to be tarnished by a gay man being \"effeminate\".\n\nWhat I admire about Kay's anti-homosexual arguments is that they're based on the observation that man-made law has the potential to evolve to accommodate the development of an evolving society. To the extent that we are aware of this, we don't try and ignore it, we actively deal with it.\n\nComing of age in the 1970's, I learned that marrying would suddenly be the norm for a lot of gay people. Two exceptions to this were the Boomer and the Silent generation (post 1950s), and the LGBQT category, which we now live in. What I found very interesting is that these two groups, were not subjected to either the \"anti-gay bigotry\" on the one hand, or the \"empowerment\" of gay people on the other. Rather, the gay-born would be welcomed, proffered a spouse, welcomed into the fold, and proffered a job, to all intents and purposes. Gay activists were simply not prepared for this.\n\nTo highlight the difference between the gay rights movements that have sprung up on the one hand, and the \"blue\", haughty lack of intent with respect to marriage, between the LGBT activist movement and the abject insistence on the societal acceptability of homosexuality in the specific form, is a telling lesson.\n\n\nHow I felt after listening to Nick Belot's Real and Unwritten Art Of Marriage, during the Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade, West Side Market, Chicago, 2016\n\nReceiving the February 1976 Cecil Park Frady Award (An honor given by the City of Chicago for support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community) for Best New & Emerging Artist.\n\nThe above may or may not be as important as the following statement, from founder of The Fraternity, Jeff Glatzer:\n\n\"Let me add that we did have one gay man in the Fraternity who, incidentally, left about 5 or 6 months after reading Travolta's book. He had become seriously ill. It wasn't him, it was the gays. And when I then, the late Frady, became the leader of gay and lesbian people and gay rights in Chicago, it was not in spite of his being gay, or even protesting that gay was not good, or in spite of my having established The Fraternity, but because of his passing away. Those now-hated gays are trying to reverse something that was accomplished. Gay people are growing up a little like a lot of the choir children in a convent. It's being quiet, it's growing up, and then one day the choir bells will ring.\n\n\"For those who aren't even alive to see what it looks like, we remember when Tommy Gunn (March 14, 1907\u2013May 12, 2000) boarded the Oakland and Baltimore, L.L. Bean & Co. buses. Those teens ran up to the man in the white suit and exclaimed, \"Who wants to be Mr. Toy?\" Tommy sneered his way across the room, disregarded the one who inquired, and took his seat. When someone asked him which boy wanted to be Mr. Toy, he said, \"I don't care. I'll be Mr. Slider. All the children are my brothers.\" Though, as the boy who asked the question died shortly thereafter, the next city where he lived, he shot", "human": "Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendment\n\nby Rick Moen\n\nAugust 25, 2008\n\n(last updated August 6, 2018)\n\nThis past century, large portions of the American South have been consumed by an unintended side-effect.\n\nI refer to the infamous \"kudzu\" vine, imported from Japan for its stunning erosion-control properties. This tactic worked: Crumbling riverbanks and hillsides were stabilized all over the South \u2014 but, then, everyone realized with mounting horror that this hardy legume is almost completely unstoppable anywhere protected from hard freezes, growing at the awesome rate of a foot per night and reaching heights of 100 feet. Entire abandoned houses have been observed to vanish under a kudzu carpet, over a summer growing season. It's now considered a pest; sometimes, an outright menace.\n\nThe plant can be used with caution, where its invasive side-effect is known and planned for \u2014 but the point is that it was deployed without understanding its full effects.\n\nLaws' side-effects, likewise, can render them self-defeating (though, on the bright side, bad laws are easier to eradicate than kudzu): I'm going to explain, below, why recently popular marriage-definition legislation like California's November 2008 \"California Marriage Protection Act\" (an initiative state-constitutional amendment) creates kudzu-class unintended side effects its proponents haven't anticipated and will find horrific \u2014 in that they're going to end up mandating and legally sanctifying exactly the sort of same-sex marriages they're intending to ban.\n\nPlease note: Yr. humble author is deliberately avoiding the question of whether same-sex marriage is desirable, an offense against God, and so on. (For what it's worth, said author is a heterosexual genetic male, happily and monogamously married to qty. one (1) heterosexual genetic female. So, this essay is not a sneaky ploy to induce gender confusion in unwary citizens.) It's not that I don't have opinions on that contentious question. It's just that they're not relevant to what I'm writing about.\n\nIn short: I'm going to show that recent legislation restricting marriage to \"a man and a woman\" \u2014 regardless of whether you consider that effort good, bad, or indifferent \u2014 is going to produce harmful, unintended side effects (maybe even for you, your family, your friends, and so on), exactly the opposite of what proponents intend.\n\nI'll not be moralizing, and this isn't lobbying from the \"intersex\" movement or anyone else. I'm just a regular hetero guy, quietly telling you what's starting to happen, why, and how to see for yourself. OK?\n\nMarriage Protection Meets Biology\n\nHere's the sort of law we're talking about:\n\nProposition 8\n\nEliminates Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry: Initiative Constitutional Amendment SECTION I. Title This measure shall be known and may be cited as the \"California Marriage Protection Act.\" SECTION 2. Article I. Section 7.5 is added to the California Constitution, to read: Sec. 7.5. Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\n\nNow, that's simple and should have predictable, orderly results, right? I'll bet the Soil Conservation Service guys in the 1950s thought that about kudzu, too.\n\nThe biggest problem is that laws like the California initiative will make the courts decide who is male and who is female \u2014 and all available decision criteria create unavoidable miscarriages of justice that will, or should, dismay initiative proponents.\n\nYou're probably thinking, about now, that I'm going to exaggerate the sex-definitional1 problem: Probably, you and everyone you know is unambiguously male or female \u2014 or at least has always believed himself or herself to be so, and nobody's challenged that, and nobody's likely to.\n\nThat's true, absolutely: Only maybe one live birth in 100 has some non-standard sex anatomy, and genetic anomalies are slightly rarer than that. However, let's talk about those 1-in-100 or 1-in-1000 cases \u2014 because those could be you, or your aunt, or your best friend \u2014 and because our system of law has to deal with 1-in-1000 situations, too.\n\nAn illustrative example: Let's say you're an adult woman. You were always female; you never had any doubts about this. You have all the right parts and none of the wrong ones; you think of yourself as a gal. You get married. (Yes, I do mean to a man.)

{"eta": "As the Internet and its younger retarded brother, the social media, slowly enter the deep-end of the pool together, the frequency of'morally grey situations' starts increasing. We're already witnessing an unprecedentedly close relationship between the society at large and the internet.\n\nThe number of people paying attention to public events on social media continues to increase dramatically. The mere fact that a single picture can provoke a thousand reactions is proof enough of this in itself. In this respect, the result of the increasing number of reactions on social media is nothing less than an expansion of the collective collective behavior.\n\nWe also see an increasing openness towards persons with disabled or effeminate characteristics. In a nutshell, people realise that while their best buddies do not feel comfortable with them at their level, many others are finding it good at simply joining in without asking.\n\nOn the other hand we see an increasing interest in perfecting'sexual modalities'. Is it not remarkable that social media and the constant exchange of photographs and videos of people who are already sexually experienced are a development of sexualisation? Who could have imagined that by now, there are free live webcam services, free pornographic videos, live-streaming on social networks? Is this not a special case, where the virtual world takes a more important part?\n\nAnd then there is a growing use of the term'mass media', which we all believe to be harmless and has little to do with the way things are nowadays. This new movement expresses itself in the overt display of sexual appeal for which different factors come into play. We are seeing, for example, the appearance in the German social media of contemporary furniture that appears to be designed for purpose-ful sexual pleasure (check the furbide Kino). Our participation in the new form of pornography also gives rise to an even more immediate use: one can clearly discern the struggle and angst of a young person, born with this kind of curiosity, who wants to discover for himself.\n\nThe image of the'salon dancer' is so old that it has literally become an image. It is one of my friends' favourite trends since I first saw this kind of dancing in the late 80\u2032s, when the salon was not particularly prominent in the media.\n\nIncreasingly the'salon dancer' is also viewed by some as a possibility. Why would you ask me for a dance after buying an apartment where you can finally find the shop you are dreaming of? If the answer is no, then the mangy b-boy may just have a point.\n\nSometimes I even find some great meaning in the picture. If in the past he was an artiste, he could have made that object vanish with his talent. And, for that matter, making sense of this fundamental unmade, the groom-turned-barren, seems even more troubling.\n\nI feel that this is becoming a kind of movement away from secularism towards something more violent. (Read my latest essay on this, where I attempt to explain the inadequacies of the modern feminism without romanticizing it in any way). I'm not sure what that will lead to. But I will not rule it out!\n\nDecades ago, during the Soviet Union, we didn't have any ongoing discussions about, for example, 'Western cultural imperialism'. Today, even in European countries that allow an openness to all sorts of influences from outside, what is displayed is growing suspicion towards the West, that is, towards 'the West' in general.\n\nThat is, people assume that by suppressing others' thought, they will be able to force the West into their program. We need to look at the economic reforms that have been pushed so hard in Europe during the past couple of years, which, I think, appear in a vacuum to everyone watching. In reality, they don't cover anything whatsoever. In fact, we are witnessing not even Western culture within Europe, but the collapse of the traditional sense of nationhood that once had long united people in Europe. Why is this happening? What is happening in Europe? Why is it that there is an attempt by the left to mainstream right-wing populism into Europe's culture? Why are they right about everything and the left wrong about everything? The answer to these questions is not 'globalist technologization' (because it's not happening anywhere that we are aware of), not 'the economy' (because people who have short-term goals would prefer it to be the economy), but a negative separation between 'we' as in individual nations with different languages, languages that have different ethics, cultures, traditions, traditions that constantly conflict with each other, values that grow up outside the very recent history. For that matter, differences in opinions and histories with regard to women's rights should also be looked at with a critical eye.\n\nDiversity without Universalism and UN-sanctioned civil societies\n\nAs we see it, there are no communities or conflicts, no cultural wars over who is right or wrong, no", "topp": "As the Internet and its younger retarded brother, the social media, slowly enter the deep-end of the pool together, the frequency of'morally grey situations' starts increasing. We're already witnessing an unprecedentedly close relationship between the society at large and the internet.\n\nThe number of people religiously trolling or spreading lies on social media continues to increase in the USA alone (some people think that's the reason why the candidate, Donald Trump, wins presidential elections around the world). To make matters worse, social media is already being used as a tool to blackmail or assassinate people, a behavior that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. You might have heard the phrases \"WE WANT YOU BACK!\" and \"SPEECH OF POLITICS\" used in direct quotes everywhere, but these sentiment are often attributed to politicians trying to atone for their words or to make more money \u2013 those who did not do it wrong and those who glorified the reasons that governed previous generations. Furthermore, politicians and very hardline leaders would advise their followers to always analyze personal and political realities to determine which path to take. This cult of anti-establishment, fantasy \"democracy\" has become a powerful word.\n\nYou see, there are cases when a term such as \"democracy\" is being used incorrectly in a negative context. A politician often uses that term as a code. The word implies some level of same-realistic realization. Otherwise we'd have to vote for the far right populist on the 'worst of the worst' list (which included Trump). When it gets down to the street, we are brainwashed and betray our youth, as Martin Amis describes in his bestseller 'I Am Not Your Negro'. In chapter 3 of his book 'On Men and Boys, a chapter on prisons, Amis talks about youngsters who are rejected, thrown from their apartment by their parents and went to live with adult delinquents, or gets sent off to some reeking, grim suburb to live for a while in the shadows, pushed on the street by childhood myths and conditioned responses. We constantly yearn for freedom. We grow up missing it in both senses and how else can we relate to each other. This is something that the case studies prepared during our research particularly revealed. They show that a person in society can also deny what is happening around him, but at the same time not admit to the wrongs he is suffering. But this context is very narrow, the concepts of a society are so weak that we continue to make things up.\n\nIn short, our awareness of the right to social equality, social justice and liberation has been very low, but also it's also at a point where it's dangerous and in danger of being lost. For this reason, we decided to work on the understanding of consciousness with a focus on the human capacity for thinking \u2013 the capacity to investigate the way we experience reality and to be capable of informing ourselves for our own betterment. In one of our reflections, we referred to consciousness as a product of human ingenuity. That is the sense of wonder that a human animal might have around him in the natural environment.\n\nWe could say that the relative neglectedness of the right to social equality is due to the state of modern society, but also to corruption. It is hardly a secret that, in those countries that are struggling the most against the specter of authoritarianism, an assessment of the right to social justice and liberation tends to be much less discussed than in the United States. As an example of corruption in some place, let us take Cyprus, where democracy, personal freedom and protection for the family exist. Incidentally, the case study released in our publications, 'Citizens of Central Cypriot Take Their Right for Emancipation To The Limit', could be one of the most significant in international political psychology.\n\nTo us, Cypriot society is comparable to a fortified fortress against the crushing effects of Western civilisation. The brave defenders of free society who had managed to find the means to defend themselves had been forced to withdraw. However, the walls of the fortress are still standing and every day, there is new attempt by the enemy to breach the chain. One can still find cold concrete, rotten walls, broken windows and ruined windows, scammers stealing money without asking and thugs sending out angry text messages. Migrants are also supposed to be welcomed here as necessary soldiers, but the results of their battle are always mixed, with the population trying to find reasons why their children will find the path away from the prison or working abroad. Here too, people forget that the last time the walls of the fortress collapsed, the prisoners who were being constantly threatened with corporal punishment were killed; they were only thinking of trying to escape. Thus, citizens of Central Cypriot take their right for emancipation to the limit, but with every step onwards it only becomes harder and harder. There is more resistance but also more of resistance, whose gains increase. Because, there is no hope at all, there is just violence and individuals feeling as though they are", "human": "As the Internet and its younger retarded brother, the social media, slowly enter the deep-end of the pool together, the frequency of 'morally grey situations' starts increasing.\n\nThis is only natural\u2014for those that know technology (the users of the Internet) cannot see beyond it, and those who do not know technology (the users of social media) cannot see into it.\n\nSo when Sagarika Ghose is bad-mouthed on Twitter and the BBC >covers it with an article titled: \"Why are Indian women being attacked on social media?\", we should refrain from jumping to certain conclusions.\n\nConclusions like Ms. Ghose's assumption that women abused on Twitter tend to be 'liberal and secular' or that her online abusers must be angry at 'women who speak their mind.' Or even (a BBC-drawn conclusion) that the Indian patriarchal mentality is 'carrying over to the Internet.'\n\nWhile the above statements may be justified, and even correct, the broader aspect of online abuse cannot be as simple as that. It is at, its heart, a clash of civilisations. A battle royale between netizens and the Twitterati.\n\nFrom 1995 to nearly 2005 \u2013 2006, the Internet encouraged free discussion of even the most taboo topics\u2014as in most forums, people were able to wrap a cloak of anonymity around themselves. During this period there was no Facebook, no Twitter. Before the advent of social media and its ilk, a person's online identity could not possibly represent the whole of a person's actual identity! This was because for the most part, people functioned on the Internet under some nickname or the other.\n\nIndeed, many of the Internet's earliest communities (IRC, various bulletin board messaging systems etc) were built in such a manner that an individual's personal identity played no role in the functioning of these forums. Indeed, a derivative of this principle was that users were actually discouraged to shed parts of their personal identity to be able to function on these forums. Why was this , you ask? For the simple reason that there was no way to verify ones identity, even if you wanted to reveal it!\n\nRubber ducky\n\nThis indirectly led to a different definition of identity itself. You could be Indian, Chinese, American, Russian, gay, straight, male, female\u2014all depending merely on what you fancied on being that day. In fact, this phenomenon became so prevalent; the founder of 4Chan put a word to it. He called it 'fluid identity'. Moving from being one person to the other, nobody could stop you.\n\nThese principles were embraced, which lead to slurs like f***er, w**re, s**t becoming commonplace. Why? Because the Internet initially, was at its essence, home to basically an anonymous pool of people from around the world.\n\nAnd when you call somebody a w**re, what you are essentially doing is reducing their identity down to the most simplest level. It was commonly assumed that everybody would lie about who they were, and by slandering everyone with an insult, they could move discussion forward from there onwards.\n\nAlmost how in certain tribal groups, when a boy becomes a man, he is given a new name and then only allowed to lead his life. Similarly, bringing your own ethnicity or political affiliation or orientation of any form to the Internet was simply not necessary - as the Internet would remove it anyway. In some forums, it was considered almost rude to draw attention to yourself in that fashion.\n\nAnd this is what people, who take offense to online abuse, are truly missing. You see that blue, ostentatious check mark symbol next to Sagarika Ghose's Twitter handle?\n\nThe Twitterati and Facebook personalities who embrace the confirmation of their own real-world identities\u2014and indeed broadcast to the whole Internet that \"yes, this is the true Sagarika Ghose\" are trying to bring the physical world's notion of identity onto the Internet. And this is where our problem starts.\n\nPolitical scientist Samuel Huntington gained prominence for his theory\u2014t >he Clash of Civilisations\u2014 where he postulated that all sources of conflicts in the future would not be ideological, but rather cultural in nature.\n\nIdentity mismatch\n\nAnd do we not see this happening, twenty years later, on the Internet? On the one hand you have the old users of the Internet with notions of fluid identity, and on the other hand you have social media users who wish to reclaim their right to be offended! It is a clash between users of websites with different identifying natures, with different cultures. The point here is that, for users of the old Internet, it is not just Sagarika Ghose who is a s**t, but in that everybody is a s**t.\n\nWhat would be ideal at this point, however, is for both camps to understand each other's stance and together develop a new concept of online identity", "eta_suffix": " the very recent history.

The scheme has benefited people across the country and it is hoped that it will continue to benefit. The package of programs outlined below will help more than 12.7 million Australians, including some who were currently eligible for the fee-for-service program, access services through the scheme. This outline outlines the main points of the package of programmes the Dental Scheme for Every Patient has to offer.\n\nWhat is the Dental Scheme for Every Patient?\n\nThe Dental Scheme for Every Patient is a public health measure that replaces the current fee-for-service program for dental professionals. The new program provides government funding and uniform access to the main dental services, while addressing barriers that are contributing to high dental treatment waiting lists.\n\nThe Dental Scheme for Every Patient is a public health measure to reduce the burden on the health care system by increasing access to primary and preventative dentistry.\n\nWhat are the main changes?\n\nThe main program changes are:\n\nThe Dental Scheme for Every Patient is based on six 'Dentistry Services for a Healthy Australia' (DSAH). These DSH will enable dental professionals to meet the needs of patients with 'complex' dental needs.\n\nThe DSH program for acute problems such as short and long term periodontal disease is shared by Dental Health Australia (DHA) and the Australian Government at the request of each state and territory. Patients will access services at least 1 year after referral, based on their severity and location.\n\nThe DSAH programs have been rolled out in South Australia, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. This page lists details of the Dental Services for a Healthy Australia programs for each of the six states and territory.\n\nWhat makes Dental Services for a Healthy Australia eligible to be part of the Dental Scheme for Every Patient?\n\nThe Dental Services for a Healthy Australia programs are eligible to be used by State and Territory public healthcare providers, as well as private practitioners.\n\nThe DSH programs are provided on a revenue-sharing basis and funded from a Public Health Arrangements Budget (PHAB) administered by a DHA.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the Department of Health collects $400M in revenue annually and the DHA uses the remainder to fund its programs. The DHA receives royalties from some commercial dental services for the NHS dental scheme.\n\nWhat is the need for this service?\n\nThe scheme targets people with complex dental problems. The Dental Programme for Every Patient is designed to address barriers at the front line by:\n\nproviding durable health insurance, access to preventive dentistry including root canals, preventative treatment and longer term preventative care, and help with individuals trying to navigate the complicated periodontial process\n\na low barrier to entry into dental practice, with modern facilities enabling more people to access care\n\nProviding full range of primary, preventative and emergency care including dental planning with electronic health record (EHR) use.\n\nThe Dental Scheme for Every Patient will:\n\nImprove access to quality health outcomes to Australia's rural and remote populations\n\nImprove access to dental services for the purposes of health management for persons with chronic conditions, diseases of the oral and pharyngeal regions, or those with cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, lung cancer, cardiovascular or respiratory disease, osteoporosis, certain infectious diseases, and many other health conditions\n\nReduce dental treatment waits\n\nImprove access to healthcare on-reserve and rural communities\n\nReduce income inequalities: Patients in rural and remote communities may be at greater financial risk and these communities may be disproportionately affected by the effectiveness of access to health care programs for dental-related problems\n\nReduce the number of people in \"partly healthy\" health because they do not receive routine preventive care and receive inadequate primary and preventative dental care\n\nWhat services will be covered by the Dental Services for a Healthy Australia Programmes?\n\nThe most common services covered by the Dental Services for a Healthy Australia programmes will be:\n\nPrimary Preventive. Primary prevention services include a number of basic measures that effectively reduce the risk of developing and presenting preventable disease. They include the following:\n\nPseudo-preventive oral health screening (e.g. adult dental check-ups and vaccinations)\n\nGranulomatous pustular disease (kneecaps) screening\n\nNontracinated (nonsurgical) tooth roots (long or narrow), or caries reduction (discontinuous root canal) treatment\n\nEggplants and other treatments for early term root canal\n\nDental", "topp": "Updated 8 December 2009\n\nAmanda Biggs\n\nSocial Policy Section\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nCiting long waiting lists for public dental services and financial barriers to treatment, Dental Australia launched the Dental Scheme for Every Patient in 2004.

This outline outlines the main points of the package of programmes the Dental Scheme for Every Patient has to offer.\n\nWhat is the Dental Scheme for Every Patient?\n\nThe Dental Scheme for Every Patient is a public health measure that replaces the most costly public dental services in Australia: Grant-in-Aid for the Potentially Preventable Diseases.\n\nWhat does the Dental Scheme for Every Patient offer?\n\nThe Dental Scheme for Every Patient provides:\n\nRecognition of people in need of dental treatment so that if needed, no-charge private dentistry is available;\n\nCoverage of some activities that were not covered under the PFB;\n\nShort-term rehabilitation programmes and community support;\n\nPreventative dentistry and cleanings; and\n\nDental hygienist support and and dental support services.\n\nDuring consultation with the community, the Dental Scheme for Every Patient will also be designed to respond to short-term demand.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nPeople who either:\n\nHave lost the benefit of the FPF for the Potentially Preventable Diseases program for at least 3 years or\n\nHave been diagnosed with a disease that needs public health intervention; or\n\nAre under 18 years of age\n\nNewly admitted people are treated on a fee-for-service basis, but eligible patients may be referred to community dental practices for longer term treatment. Public Health Minister Peter Dutton says:\n\nAll newly admitted patients being treated in the public system should be required to pay, regardless of financial circumstances, for their work, if needed. In every case where an area needs extra funding, we will work with regional health authorities to find ways to meet the gap.\"\n\nWhat are some services that a person will need to access?\n\nA new appeal process under the Dental Scheme will respond to applications within weeks for all trials and postgraduate training stations closed in 2001 and 2007. A final decision on eligibility will follow within 180 days of receipt of initial applications from government pharmacists. District Health Boards are required to respond to the Dental Scheme for Every Patient for the NHS service sites they run and are subject to the accountability review arrangements of the Dental scheme. A further announcement will be made this year on how funding will be distributed, based on available community resources.\n\nWhat will be the application process?\n\nInformation about the application process will be available on this website.\n\nWho is responsible for the payment of public dental services?\n\nCommunity pharmacy and community dental practice have responsibility for processing applications for public dental services. This is separate from the public dental practice and community dental practice functions described above. Further information is available on the Public Health Commission website.\n\nHow will the following be provided?\n\nDental Services will be provided free of charge:\n\nOn a chronic or long-term basis\n\nFunding for procedures is managed by community pharmacies and Community Dental Clinics\n\nGovernment dental clinics can access dental facilities at the private level in their community for referral or review. This is provided to them after consultation with local health authorities who are responsible for licensing, audits, and inspections of Community Dental Clinics.\n\nDental Hygiene\n\nPreventive Dentistry and Cleanings\n\nDental Application Support\n\nWhat is community dental practice?\n\nCommunity dental practice is a category of professional that has been integrated into the health system. It has responsibility for reviewing and resolving complaints regarding the quality and appropriateness of the Dental Scheme for Every Patient. It enables health professionals to communicate with their community about their practice and to advocate for patients. For example, health professionals can review materials issued by community dental clinics and provide feedback about the private dental care they may be able to provide for patients at the community level. This can be done via community dental practices web pages and through the Health and Medical Information Management System.\n\nRecognition of local people's care and public health services\n\nHealth professionals and people's organisations that are willing to deal directly with the community about their needs and reduce wait times are eligible for community dental practice support. These people's services will be provided by community dental practices. For example:\n\nCommunity dental practices can provide dental hygiene, cleanings and patient education and access water fountains and secure free toilet facilities for patients and community members.\n\nHealth professionals can choose if they wish to seek individual approval in accordance with available resources or if they", "human": "Updated 8 December 2009\n\nAmanda Biggs\n\nSocial Policy Section\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nCiting long waiting lists for public dental services and financial barriers to timely dental care, the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission (NHHRC) proposes the establishment of the Denticare Australia scheme, to provide a 'universal scheme for access to basic dental services' in its final report to government.[1] Supplementing this, the NHHRC also proposes an expansion of existing state-based school dental programs, more funding for oral health promotion and an internship scheme for dental graduates. The Denticare scheme and related dental health proposals, were first suggested in the NHHRC's interim report. These remain essentially unchanged in its final report.[2]\n\nThe Denticare scheme was one of the 'most welcomed' of all the reform proposals contained in the Commission's interim report, issued in November 2008.[3] Nevertheless, the response to the Denticare proposal has not been universally positive. Issues that were raised in the wake of the interim report, such as the cost of the scheme, access for disadvantaged groups, and the capacity of the dental workforce, continue to be of concern.[4]\n\nThis Background Note provides an outline of the proposed Denticare scheme, including the dental services to be covered, cost estimates and financing arrangements. Responses to the proposal and some key issues for further discussion are highlighted.\n\nWhat is Denticare Australia?\n\nThe final report recommends, among other dental and oral health proposals, the establishment of Denticare Australia, through which all Australians would have access to a 'basic package' of dental services. These dental services would be provided through either the public or private sector and be funded by Denticare Australia at no or at subsidised cost to users.\n\nThe basic package of dental services would include preventive work (such as scaling and cleaning of teeth), diagnostic (x-rays), extractions and restorative work (such as fillings of cavities) as well as the provision of dentures. People could choose to have the basic package of dental services provided through a private dental plan or under public dental arrangements.\n\nFull details of what services would be covered are not provided in the report, but it makes clear that certain 'additional' services such as orthodontics would not be included under the basic package. Individuals wanting additional dental services, the NHHRC suggests, would have the option of purchasing additional health insurance products.[5] Purchasing dental services directly, that is, without buying insurance, is not an option canvassed in the final report.\n\nThese proposed arrangements are outlined below.\n\nThose who choose the private option would purchase a health plan from a private health insurer to cover a 'basic package' of dental services. Denticare Australia would pay the premium for these plans, which would meet approximately 85 per cent of private dental costs; representing a significant discount.[6] The remaining costs would be paid by consumers although these co-payment amounts are expected to be lower than currently applies.[7] Consumers would then access basic dental services through a private dentist where most of their dentist's fees would be met by the private health plan.\n\nThe interim report proposed that the premium paid by Denticare Australia to private health insurers, be 'risk adjusted'.[8] This would mean that a person assessed with a higher dental risk would pay a higher premium than someone assessed as having a lower dental risk. However, this proposal is not repeated in the final report, leaving open the question of what sort of premiums would apply..\n\nThose who decline the private health plan option would have access to basic dental services free of charge through state-based public dental services. These services would receive expanded funding from Denticare Australia, although the level of this expanded funding is not detailed in the final report. Those accessing public dental services may still face delays for treatment, but the NHHRC expects waiting times to be less than is currently the case.\n\nAccess to public dental services would not attract a co-payment, even where services are contracted out to private dentists. Nor would public dental services only be restricted to those on concession cards as is currently the case.[9] Anyone opting not to purchase a private dental plan could access public dental services. However, it is not clear how someone who had already purchased a private plan, but who then elects to be treated in a public dental clinic, would be prevented from doing so.\n\nThe final report notes that some specialised services such as those provided to people with an intellectual disability may only be available through public dental clinics.[10]\n\nThe final report estimates that the cost of the Denticare scheme including the related dental proposals, would be around $5.5 billion annually (this costing includes funding for the proposed dental internship program, expansion of the school dental program and the oral health promotion program).

{"eta": "Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nThis article originally appeared in Vulture.\n\n\"When I'm onstage, I get real happy up there. Maybe it's because I have a smile like a dead person.\"\n\nThat line, from comedian-actor Drew Carey, is the quintessential embodiment of how Reggie Watts feels. \"When I'm onstage, I get real happy up there. Maybe it's because I have a smile like a dead person,\" the Straight Outta Compton-collaborator tells me over the phone from his home in Los Angeles, where he was recently seen on HBO's The Armstrong Lie. The 70-year-old Watts was hardly exaggerating the contrast, either. \"I've got a look of happy death in me, on my face,\" says the movie theater regular. \"The best way you can show that is by on stage.\"\n\nThat came through on the 2013-2014 edition of Rick Astley and the Black Eyed Peas' sold-out show at the Staples Center, just weeks before Watts became his last role. Watts, who co-stars in the Academy Award-nominated comedy Trainwreck, played the \"idol\" of a Transformer named Mack, which pulls the best in what's the new (and uber-popular) family-friendly toy made by Mattel.\n\nWatts' career was once as big a deal in music as the Emmys. Though his first big hit, 1995's \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" made Watts one of R&B's most popular artists, it wasn't until 1993, when he shot to stardom on \"We Shall Overcome,\" that he had a bona fide hit on the pop charts. Since then, he's appeared in five Hunger Games films, a Vogue hit, and even played the proprietor on Showtime's recent drama Shameless. \"People are watching me, and they have no idea who I am,\" says Watts, who's been doing Broadway for about a decade now. \"I felt like an eccentric next to Oprah.\"\n\nWatts is quick to remind me of all of these accomplishments. \"We used to sit here and talk about how great I was,\" he says, adding later, \"We never did that [on-stage]. But now I get to talk about what I know and I can relate to people.\" It turns out that Watts understands this just as well as any person I've ever met who can't entirely make an exit from Hollywood without owning their greed and meanness.\n\nAs I try to imagine who might emulate him \u2014 me, he, someone like Taylor Swift, a good kid looking for a way to show he can still cut a convincing rap \u2014 I realize how different the world would be if this had been happening decades ago. Not only would people probably have taken Watts seriously as an actor; we might all be curious about what the movies-turned-performance art projects he's put on go on to be. The closest comparisons I've seen, however, are Twix, another singer-songwriter who talks like Drew Carey, or, maybe more recently, Tove Lo.\n\nDespite his success, Watts says the only real moment of vulnerability he had is during a visit to the Boston Red Sox game the night of the 2003 World Series, when he returned home for Christmas and was asked to perform at the Celtics' victory parade as a sign of respect. \"I spent $20 of my own money to get the microphone,\" he chuckles. The event came about thanks to a night when Watts' collaborator Taylor Swift and Kanye West bought a custom-tailored suit for him to wear that morning in Boston, and he stepped into the top. And perhaps it turned out to be both a celebratory moment, and a little dangerous. \"Nobody knows if I did it in the right way,\" he says, rubbing his temple in the director's chairs. \"I don't want my next hat to look this way.\"\n\n\"I spent $20 of my own money to get the microphone.\"\n\nThis isn't the whole story. Watts is actually an expert storyteller. When we meet, he's dressed in street clothes \u2014 black shorts, socks, a hoodie \u2014 sitting on the sidewalk outside his house in West Los Angeles, overlooking the Santa Monica Mountains. \"I'm never onstage unless I've got something to tell somebody else in the moment,\" he tells me. At any given moment, he's available for a single talk: his personal problems, his relationships, the far-flung influences in music he loves most. \"At any given time,\" is the operative phrase. But for the longest time, he wasn't in the habit of making sure to tell us precisely what he was up to. At times, he hides that a major song is on the way, or maybe he hasn't told us what, exactly, he's been up to. \"I haven't given details to people that can just put a string together,\"", "topp": "Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nThis article originally appeared in Vulture.\n\n\"When I'm onstage, I get real happy up there. Maybe it's because I have a smile like Ayn Rand, or maybe it's because Michael is it's everything.\" \u2014 Michael Che on hitting hard, determinedly playing a role that he clearly takes way more seriously than his controller understands. He's right. Big runs. Bleeding chops. Wailing/thumping/jumping/crooning/brooding overbroken bass. Big crashes. Che directs, ranks, and commands like always, but he's now just doing it all for himself, just living out the scenes the cast, crew, and show creators have placed him in. He's back to being a kid. Or is he? A year from now, he'll be 29 years old, on his sixth album with a bunch of new material. He'll be running a different culture and community. He'll be helming a new layer of support for toxic masculinity. He'll be serving on his first gay show and opening Doors for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"I thought it would be cool, be more real. Maybe be real about [everybody's] relationship to me being real, like we really relate and you make room for me,\" he says. \"And then I realized\u2014it's not, it's a different thing. Everybody kind of ends up fighting, love is hard, so maybe it's just gonna be me more, I'll just work with people's egos. I'm just going to play it a little more of like one of these best friends in the world kind of thing where we kind of live life like they do, or we want to, but we'll adjust to the situation.\"\n\nChe and I are already talking about the current scene in hip-hop. Bored rappers starting to deal with losing their careers to things like rappers on hiatus, harassment, their addiction and being fat\u2014it's a ripple effect that hasn't happened yet. Y.G., who changed his style of hip-hop when Y.G. became the full-on lord of the underground, is probably on to a new way of steering his example. Che is rapping with a voice he has never worked with before, and he's ready to show us his vision with The Very Next Episode, just in time for the festival circuit. Che has now memorized every drum pattern of every good hip-hop beat and has mastered every phat beat. He works using JMU's ProTools and shears, but the music is clear and good enough that it almost doesn't need an engineer (though when he played a piano so horrible that the audio would shut down, I was sent to a renowned mastering studio in Ireland so I could hear it).\n\n\"It was all it was. The production stayed the same, so it didn't change, just made you wish you could just move and make music more easily,\" he says, pointing out that I, of course, would like to have a music studio someday\u2014it's probably beyond The Very Next Episode, and before Che goes any further, I should point out that I already do.\n\nWith Its Very First Episode, Michael Che Shows People Could Play Music Too\n\nCuring A Sad Friend\n\nIn October, Che sat at the bar with two women over a couple glasses of beer on a Saturday night. As the bar settled in for the night's dance party\u2014dozens of young people clustered in the corner, snacking on sake, drinking Budweiser and Iceberg to their hearts' content, whether hip-hop, EDM, techno, or electronica\u2014the group's conversation fell into one of the more interesting, and important conversations these past four years: Did you ever miss being alive?\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"Did it ever get in the way? \" one of the women asked. \"It's always like, \"We've gotta go,\" I go, \"We've gotta, because I have like this beer on me, and I'm like like, 'Dude, I can't. I have to do this,' \" Che thought to himself, waiting to find the answer. And then he did.\n\n\"I used to be like, as soon as I came back from a trip,\" Che says, standing up on stage after wrapping up The Very Next Episode. \"You know when you hit the studio and you're like, 'I just need to work?' But I'd just wanna...feel my way through the day.\"\n\n\"Should I stay home?\" I suggest. \"I should stay home. I've always, since I was in school, been an asshole. I would use my friends to do something, and it was being a creative person. Like I had to use my friends to do something, or I just kept doing the same thing", "human": "Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nThis article originally appeared in Vulture.\n\n\"When I'm onstage, I get real happy up there. Maybe that's the only time in my adult life that I feel like myself. You're standing up there\u2014you know what I mean\u2014like a gladiator, and them lights is on you, and you look down and everyone's looking up at you ... and it's all these smiles around you. And they get dressed and they put perfume on and stuff, and they're going to see your show. That feels good, man. These people, you know, they love you. Even if it's for a minute, they really do. They love you, man. You know, it's like a love-fest ... It's the best feeling, man. I love stand-up.\" \u2013 Dave Chappelle, Inside the Actor's Studio, 2006\n\nThe lights go dark. A giant silhouette of Dave Chappelle appears onstage. The curtain drops, and all you see is a puff of smoke. Wearing a slim black two-button suit, he tells the crowd, who collectively decided to giving him a standing ovation before he said a word, to sit down, to relax. \"This is a very special night,\" he says before launching into his first joke. \"You know what I feel like, being in New York this week? Like a motherfucker who's been locked up for a decade.\" He pauses there, puffs his American Spirit, and lets the laughter settle a little. \"People see me like, 'Damn, nigga, you got swole. How have you been, baby boy?' Pretty good! Pretty fucking good.\" The crowd erupts in approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThis is why he quit Chappelle's Show. This is why he walked away from $50 million nine years ago. This is why he went to Africa. This is why he went silent, kept silent, and lived on a farm in Ohio. This is why he'd only reappear occasionally to perform poorly reviewed, loose, meandering sets of essentially shooting the shit. This is why, 10 months ago, he stopped a performance in Hartford and just quietly read his book onstage. It wasn't because he was crazy or on drugs or any of the myriad reasons people who aren't Dave Chappelle liked to say. He quit so he could eventually come back and perform a show like the one he did last night, at Radio City Music Hall, in front of 6,000 deferential, diverse, well-dressed fans.\n\nWhen I enter, I'm instantly and surprisingly overwhelmed with emotion. With a jazz trio called Supa Lowery Bros at the top of the stairs, playing an instrumental version of Kendrick Lamar's oddly appropriate \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe,\" I'm taken by how incredibly eclectic and buzzing the crowd is. I'm not exaggerating when I say it is the most diverse room I've ever been in. It looks like the streets of New York City were moved inside. It looks like the cast of Orange Is the New Black if it were half male and everyone were allowed to wear their cutest outfits (and not just because I eventually sat two seats down from Natasha Lyonne). A young Asian guy wearing a hat with the New Yorker logo on it stands in line in front of a white guy in a Twiztid hat, an Indian guy in a suit, an African-American skater in a Obey hat, and a woman in dreads who was talking to a woman with a feather in her hair. This is why Chappelle's run of ten shows needed to be here, at Radio City. It's big enough that I could see how wide-reaching his fan base is, but not so big (like Madison Square Garden would've been) that we turned into a faceless blob just moving in and out of passageways. With the band now playing a jazzed-up version of a Kanye West song, it is all reminiscent of Dave Chappelle's Block Party, Chappelle's 2006 concert documentary, which the comedian called the \"best day of my career.\"\n\nThe vibe continues inside Radio City's massive auditorium, where a DJ spins a mix of neo-soul, old-school hip-hop, and random nostalgia hat-tips. Everyone knows every word of Biggie's \"Juicy\" and the Cheers theme song. This is the first of the five shows Chappelle added after the first five sold out. Unlike on the previous nights, Chappelle splits the bill with a musician. In this case, Nas. Though Chappelle goes on first, don't be fooled. It is his show.\n\nBecause he has a musician follow him, Chappelle's one-hour-and-change set differs from the 90-minute ones that many publications reviewed last week. It's a tight set.

Typically, mattresses are either used in beds on the street or as bedding, either in hotel rooms or temporary shelter. Mattresses are used in a wide variety of styles, sizes, materials and styles. A mattress could be either a plastic sheet or a polycarbonate box with some rough padding to enhance comfort and security. Mattresses are also found as makeshift bed covers; they have been placed on sticks on roofs to provide shelter from the sun.\n\nMattresses generally have removable hooks, thereby allowing for attachment of backpacks or clothing that would normally be taken off by the sleeping homeless.\n\nMattresses usually have heaters, motors, and fans in their construction along with a wired cordless touch pad to move the mattress to the sleeping homeless. Some find this to be useful in keeping the mattress warm when cold nights come late in winter. They will often sleep with the ceiling fan running, as it allows them to keep warm without having to leave the house.\n\nWhile there are some common techniques used to organize and setup mattresses in sleeping homeless camps such as placing mattresses near water or sleeping toilets, they are generally not working for the homeless.\n\nDesignations\n\nThe one year old homeless, homeless shelters and homeless encampments in Hawaii's Central Valley have all used the following terminology:\n\nWinter Homeless, all homeless\n\nWinter homeless includes: men under 25, women under 25, and teenagers 18-22 who do not own a vehicle and have limited access to gas or other items to engage in group transportation. All these persons are typically sleeping in their cars or behind garbage dumpsters near the existing homeless encampments.\n\nJungle homeless, all homeless\n\nJungle homeless, also known as felon homeless, is homeless individuals not covered by the California Safe Streets Act. The California Safe Streets Act applies only to persons who are over age 18 who intend to commit a public nuisance, but fail to do so. In addition to the criminal offense of burglary, these offenders face a misdemeanor charge of harassment under a 1987 law that provides a mandatory 6 months to 100 hours of community service.\n\nMixed-use homeless, all homeless\n\nMixed-use homeless is typically homeless individuals whose housing is purchased or earned by converting commercial housing units into usable living quarters for homeless individuals in the private residential community.\n\nHousing Stability, all homeless\n\nHousing stability is the housing option provided by local housing agencies that can provide permanent, semi-permanent, or affordable housing for homeless individuals, and most often includes temporary solutions such as short term rentals, transitional housing, affordable housing, or other residential options such as transitional shelters.\n\nHousing Choice Voucher, all homeless\n\nHousing Choice Voucher, also commonly known as Section 8 vouchers of varying types and duration, is an ongoing housing solution providing federal, state, and local governmental assistance to homeless individuals who are willing to pay a portion of their monthly income towards renting their current home and, to some degree, their car.\n\nDisability Housing, all homeless\n\nDisability housing is housing options provided to homeless individuals who find their disabilities prevent them from finding employment and because of their lack of education often have difficulty finding a job. Section 8 public housing often is used as home protection.\n\nDiversionary Housing Program, all homeless\n\nThe DCHP is a federally funded program designed to allow the homeless to live with their family members and live in the same places as they live at the shelter. Disadvantaged homeless individuals will usually be offered this option, while those who have served prison time are often offered permanent housing.\n\nHope Works Home and Supportive Housing, single adults\n\nHope Works houses some single adults who live in shelters for adults with mental illness and those on a waiting list for Home and Medical Release (HMR) as a way to reduce stress, stress management, and isolation within the shelter setting. They will be able to live in their own homes with their families, gain employment, or attend college, and even walk through city streets and parks.\n\nHawaii\u00b4s Busted Breakout\n\nHOPE Works is a new housing program for women and children living in shelters whose families can no longer afford to move them into permanent housing. The new program was developed by Volunteers of America Hawaii from a grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The program has been phased in over a one-year period and was designed to help homeless people who have been returned to shelters or have reached a high level of unemployment get into permanent housing.\n\nWhat are the risks associated with sleeping in hotels, on the ground and in overgrown backyards?\n\nHudson County shelters and homeless encamp", "topp": "Mattress Season One, Episode Twelve First Aired December 2, 2009 Episode Guide previous next \"Hairography\" \"Sectionals\"\n\nMattress, also called a helmet, is a type of assisted-living and nursing equipment that often holds no more than a few plush pillows and a small sleeping bag. A mattress can be a customized bed provided a sufficiently large number of residents, and sometimes a solid, specialized mattress is intended to be used in conjunction with a chest of drawers, thereby enabling a totally intimate and protected sleep. Often times mattresses, and the beds used to rest them, do not come with tops. Although available in standard and customizable family sizes, only some beds use semi-customizable plastic tops\u2014for ease of installation and portability\u2014and, of course, for personal taste, some might choose to sleep on their sleeping pad if one had it at home.\n\nDowntown\n\n\"They come up from bed, count us dead\"\n\nInside the legend\n\nIn The Museum of Tomorrow, Elegantism, and the Men Who Walked By (AUST), Robert Wiblin refers to the Johnsons' favourite bedding as simply \"hairography\"\u2014a play on the word \"haiku.\" According to Wiblin, the symbol means \"understanding; reason; insight\" and appears frequently on their lights as an eyepatch worn by an elderly or disabled occupant. Wiblin has pointed out that, \"When I was growing up in Hawaii, there were lots of codes and strings that regulated haiku. I once heard a teacher complain to her students that the pronunciation of the haiku was highly contentious. 'F-A-D,' they would say, 'Sam served in Vietnam.' And this was a group of folks who thought Vietnamese martial arts titles were their best friends!\" (p. 333). Similarly, it has even been suggested that word haiku originated in the bible, though there is no evidence to support this belief. There were no haiku, as B.H. Roberts noted, \"a deeply literary genre\" that had been \"vanished from print before our time.\"9\n\nName\n\nHairography is best known from Jordan May's 1950 short story The Ghosts of China Hill, where It is named after the lanterns used at China Hill Hospital by the Greenwich Village elderly and disabled in the 1990s. Even conventional Americans often have difficulty doing the right thing when bedding doesn't have proper names\u2014such as, J.M. Barrie coined \"fast-flying fox\" as the name of another possible euphemism for bed.\n\nLegend\n\nThere are stories about the Johnsons hiding out in the closet and sleeping under what had once been beds. From A.B. Roberts, 42 Brothers (1976): \"Harold died; Sally was home sick. A journey to Moscow took him. He had been in Moscow for two weeks, starting on the 29th, but spending the last two days of his time in the hotel of the Holborn Hotel, in Moscow. It had become the Czars' sanctuary, their homestead, after the first Ukrainian war that had broken out when Catherine had been Marie's mother and, indeed, he had been there\u2014he had even pored over the records of old Holborn's hospital.\" (p. 209)\n\nHowever, there are tales of the more peaceful intermingling of a number of their descendants, who took on business as house servants or janitors, too. According to Amie Brooks, in House of Tiny, Mouse (2001): \"Ornas and Barbara McCormick are the offspring of known Cousins. Cynthia's Brother Shirley, living in Alaska, married Tom Munger\u2014not the famous Rogers The Lucky Seven grill salesman\u2014on June 12, 1938. They have made homes there ever since.\" Pam Booth claims that \"in 1980 Pat and Marcus Johnsons moved into a house next door to their forebears\u2026 Having grown up in Georgia a few miles from where the Johnsons moved, Pam said it was sometime around 1946 that 'the real [myth] I had evolved' began to take hold. 'At the time when people in Georgia were starting to get involved in the politics of the government, and they were raising 'black money,' well, I was still around, and I'd go out and run by the head office of the CIA.' \" (p. 202)\n\nTemporary\n\nThe first quote above may be a later rendering, as I don't have an original Latin transcription from Arthur Horne\u2014whose tenure at the dining room table could be responsible for any glimmers of the Johnsons' get-up. Some additional facts about the Johnsons' sleeping habits point to this particular account:\n\nWilliam Henry A Jr. worked more than five years as a plumber\u2014living in several hotels, utilities, dry cleaners, and bars\u2014in the Philippines.

It premiered on December 2, 2009.\n\nWhen the Glee Club is left out of the yearbook because of budget cuts, everyone seems to be relieved that they won't have to suffer the ridicule of years past. Everyone except Rachel, who wants her legacy cemented in print. Meanwhile, Quinn makes it her mission to be in the Cheerios yearbook photo despite her pregnancy, and Terri and Will's relationship is shaken to its core.\n\nThe episode was directed by Elodie Keene and written by Ryan Murphy.\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot\n\nWill sits with Emma and Ken in the teacher's lounge. They tell him that their wedding will be the following Saturday, on the same day as Sectionals. Sue walks in with a pair of black eyes, the result of having some work done prior to yearbook pictures. Sue tells Will she convinced Figgins not to allow Glee Club to have a yearbook picture this year.\n\nIn the choir room, Kurt explains to everyone that not having a yearbook picture may save from them countless hours of ridicule. Everyone seems to agree, at which point Will comes in and promises them he will fight to get their picture in the yearbook.\n\nWhen Will complains to Figgins, the principal tells him his only option is to buy a quarter-page ad for Glee for $325. That will be enough room for two members. Figgins suggest he pick Finn and Santana, since they are least likely to have their faces vandalized. Rachel barges into the room demanding Glee have a picture before Will tells her the news.\n\nRachel explains in a voiceover that she has joined every club possible in order to get her picture in the yearbook dozens of times. Unlike her other clubs however, Rachel is particularly proud of Glee.\n\nQuinn is watching Santana and Brittany as they look trough the yearbook and is saddened she's not on the Cheerios anymore. She decides, she wants to be on the squad again once the yearbook photos are being taken.\n\nTerri tells Will that he cannot use family funds to buy the ad for Glee. Will writes Figgins a check anyway, but asks him to wait a few days before cashing it.\n\nWill tells New Directions they must pick two team captains for the photo. Every single vote is for Rachel, and\n\nnobody else wants to be in the picture as they are all afraid of being defaced and ridiculed.\n\nWill asks Emma how to find another kid to be in the picture. She apologizes for having to miss sectionals, and Will thinks Ken scheduled the wedding conflict on purpose. Emma defends Ken and Will ends up apologizing.\n\nWill asks Rachel to pick a co-captain. Everyone she contacts comes up with bogus excuses. Eventually she's able to convince Finn to do the picture with her. Rachel says she is going to teach Finn how to smile correctly via them singing a duo of Lily Allen's Smile.\n\nSeveral of Finn's football teammates tell him they are already planning to deface his Glee picture. Finn ends up not showing up for the photo shoot and Rachel was about to give up but decided to take the picture without him. (When You're Smiling). When the photographer tells Rachel he is directing a commercial, she convinces him to cast her and the glee club. Rachel tells Glee clubbers she's landed them their first \"big break.\" The commercial is for mattresses and all the guys are excited.\n\nDuring the read-through, Rachel is able to convince the storeowner to let them sing a mattress-hopping version ofas thecommercial instead of a cheesy scenario.\n\nWhile looking for his pocket square, Will finds one of Terri's old fake pregnancy bellies. Furious, he goes to the kitchen and demands she show him her belly. The discovery leads to a huge fight, with Terri explaining the origins of the lie and telling him about adopting Quinn's baby. \"I loved you Terri,\" he says. \"I really loved you.\" and he storms out of the apartment.\n\nAt school Will finds a stack of new mattresses given to Glee from the storeowner. He opens one and puts it in his office, in order to spend the night there.\n\nSue spots the Glee kids' mattress commercial on TV.

Caribou used to be a silver camp but is deserted now. However, Nederland (the town that was established to supply Caribou) lives on. There are also many gold mines along Hwy 72 and 119. On the weekends, prospectors still pan for gold in the creeks, and there are a few gold mines along the way that allow the public to pan for the sparkling golden flakes. Visitors have to pay to pan, but children find it exciting and many times rewarding, making it worth the small fee.\n\nExplore all that the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway has to offer\n\nThe Peak to Peak Scenic Byway is a great way to see the colorful fall aspen trees\n\nIn addition to the stunning mountain scenery, this byway also provides a unique close-up look at the Continental Divide. The area is filled with aspen trees, so in the fall it becomes a dazzling quilt of gold, yellow, orange, green and brown. The fall is also a wonderful time to visit the area because it is elk mating season. Visitors flock to Estes Park to watch the mating rituals of the elk. Female and baby elk gather in a field as one male monopolizes his harem until he is challenged. The elk in this town have become so abundant that it is almost impossible to drive through Estes Park without seeing them - they almost seem to know the traffic laws!\n\nThere are many hiking trails along the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway\n\nA hike is a perfect way to bring the whole family together\n\nWhether looking for a relaxing vacation or for adventure, there are activities for all kinds of people in this area. There is hiking, climbing, river rafting, ATVing, horseback riding, biking, fishing, hunting, bird watching, shopping, dining, camping and nearby skiing in Eldora Mountain Resort. For some Hollywood sightseeing, Estes Park is also home to the Stanley Hotel, Steven King's inspiration for his famous novel \"The Shining\"; he stayed in room 217 in the nearly empty hotel the night before it closed for the season. The original film with Jack Nicolson and Shelley Duvall was not filmed here but the mini-series was.\n\nBarker Reservoir near Nederland\n\nKids can catch their share of fish at Nederland's Fishing Pond\n\nStarting in Nederland, turn right on Hwy 72 on the way to Ward.

When you hand it off it can take a few seconds for you to move some, so it's not that easy to know which hand you're receiving it from and which one you're trying to hit with it.Not saying this is never a good sign, I was at a playoff game where this happened, but that's a good sign. I don't like seeing that too much and I would have caught you up the next time you dropped that one on us.A few other things to consider, you have a fairly smooth first, next pass from them and have a pretty nice opening period.They have 2 major scoring threats with Crosby and Malkin, you have Drouin and the other Brayden Schenn.

HMS Lebel was the most valuable ship of WWII as a result of her activities in the Southern Atlantic at the expense of German shipping during this period, both in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. She was intended to bring German shipping inland before the Allies began using the build up of American and Italian ships to successfully blockade the North Sea.\n\n\nHas since become one of the most famous WWII ship pictures.\n\n\nOnly four months after the start of the war in April 1939 a small group of Americans volunteered to become part of the so-called \"Leap Day\" operation to rescue 28 desperately-needed American merchant ships stranded in British port. The landings followed successful two weeks of submarines and aircraft carrier operations.\n\n\nThe six merchant ship passengers were intended to be picked up and sent to the US after 48 hours in port but its port had been heavily bombed, leaving many of the passengers to be boarded by Jack Gilpatrick, a Chicagoan, in a dinghy, after having been dropped at Porthcothan but immediately driven to Boulogne Beach. Gilpatrick were to become the first American captured by both sides. Gilpatrick would be captured by the British two days later. All but one of the passengers had committed suicide after being hung from the deck of their ship by passing American brits (calling for 'disasters' to be'vented' and that their 'tankers' would carry the wounded back to shore).\n\n\nThough this landings was unsuccessful, it was a part of the early beginnings of U.S. strategic endeavor in the Atlantic and so preserved much of the effectiveness of Allied strategists. In March 1945 and some days after the UK capitulation the Germans sank 270 of these landing craft. Each and every one of these wrecks supposedly contains the remains of a young, terrified American girl from the middle of nowhere named Joan Leffler. Apparently the image remains a potent reminder of this shameful chapter of World War II.\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://explorer.censor.org/dirachion/presse/wess/index.html\n\n\n(partial English translation) German version\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLe Team Linkar\n\nNov 20, 2013\n\nsubmitted by: El Gelderte on November 20, 2013, 03:58:07 AM\n\nDirekt\n\n**Carsch **Carsch\n\n**Caterpillar **Caterpillar\n\n\nFord: \"We looked up and saw what you had written -- they had hired IT specialists", "human": "Title: Interesting hand on the highroller bubble.\n\nPost by: Doobs on June 29, 2013, 06:58:07 PM Interesting hand involving Matt Glantz on the bubble of the one drop. Reporting from pokernews\n\n\nFrom under the gun, Yevgeniy Timoshenko moved all in for 295,000. Action folded to Bill Perkins in the small blind, and he called. In the big blind was one of the larger stacks in the event, Matt Glantz, but he opted to fold. Glantz's fold, drew several eyebrows from other players, as they really didn't seem to understand why Glantz didn't just call because then more than likely, he and Perkins would've just checked it down with a double shot to bust Timoshenko on the bubble.\n\n\nBefore Timoshenko's hand and Perkins' hand were revealed, all other tables had to finish action, but that took a couple of minutes thanks to a hand going on at Table 453 between Lawrence Greenberg and Steve Gross.\n\n\nGreenberg had opened to 165,000 from under the gun before play folded to Gross in the big blind. He reraised all in for 910,000. Greenberg went into the tank while players swarmed the table where Timoshenko and Perkins waited patiently.\n\n\nNow, because action was still pending, Timoshenko and Perkins were not to reveal their hands. Even so, there was plenty of chatter going on about the hands Timoshenko and Perkins held, along with chatter about Glantz folding from the big blind. This chatter was very open and loud, but Greenberg didn't seem to be paying attention to any of it as he tanked with what looked like to be a very painful decision. Some of the players standing around waiting for Greenberg to decide on his action even began discussing calling the clock, but in the end felt it wouldn't be right.\n\n\nEventually, Greenberg folded his hand, and all of the attention was fully on Timoshenko and Perkins, with Timoshenko at risk of bubbling with the shorter stack.\n\n\nTimoshenko held the and was up against the for Perkins. Timoshenko was dominating Perkins, but there was still a decent chance of a chop to happen between the two players.\n\n\nOn the flop, the rolled out to help Timoshenko maintain his lead. The turn was the , and the river then completed the board with the . Timoshenko's six kicker played, and he was able to double up and then some.\n\n\n\"Thanks a lot, Matt Glantz!\" yelled Jason Koon, who was onlooking from the adjacent table. \"What the f*** was that? What is he doing?\" he said to his table as he sat back down in his chair to resume play.\n\n\n\"One-hundred percent he would've broken him,\" piped up Mike Sexton, who was at Koon's table. \"One-hundred percent.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, he would've. He said he had eight-seven off,\" added Koon.\n\n\nShaun Deeb also commented, yelling out \"Matt Glantz is horrible at poker everyone!\" from across the table of Glantz.\n\n\nAt any rate, Timoshenko doubled up and the bubble will continue.\n\n\nMatt Glantz appeared to get some stick and replied to some 2+2 baiting here\n\n\nhttp://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/general-wsop-2013-discussion-thread-1337492/index103.html (http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/general-wsop-2013-discussion-thread-1337492/index103.html)\n\n\nI was chipleader at the time and was continually chipping up with ease on the bubble without resistance. I would do everything I could at the time to extend the bubble as long as possible. $173k bubble has its advantages.\n\n\nPoker is not all math guys.

{"eta": "*****\n\n\u200bCormac McCarthy is my spirit animal (yes or no). Solitude suits me (yes or no). I prefer: overcast skies \u200bor \u200bunclouded skies (yes or no)\u200b.\n\n5. You used to cook a lot. Now, you just cook (unfortunately). What's stopping you?\n\nI just don't enjoy cooking. Food does not interest me. If it does, it turns into a chore. Cooking can seem expensive to me, even over the course of a week. Plus, I can be extremely picky with my ingredients, and my culinary knowledge isn't exactly intuitive. (Side note: just a few months ago, when I first met Josh Dzen, I might have misheard or misread his first question.) To me, cooking is a chore, not a joy!\n\nI do not like doing tasks just for the sake of doing them. I don't like feeling dependent on anyone else. In addition to not enjoying cooking, I like self-reliance. I like saying \"No!\" (at the wrong time) to people. I have a thick skin. I like being independent and don't give people as much credit as they deserve.\n\nWhen I have free time, I spend it relaxing, reading, watching movies, and reading. And I'm not sure how much I do at rest (not very much, in fact).\n\nWhen do you use the bathroom? I mostly use the shower before going to bed.\n\nI really like you and you're a lovely person. (Yes or no)\n\n6. You've been writing a lot lately. Which of your books have you found the most fun to read?\u200b\n\nThe Ayn Rand Center book last year, The Broken God, was the most enjoyable.\n\nAnd The Girl with All the Gifts was my pick for the most recently published novel.\n\nIn The Girl with All the Gifts, C. Wright Mills explores what it feels like to be afraid. But in order to find out exactly what her fears are, she must convince himself that those fears are not real fears. If it doesn't feel real, no one with C. Wright Mills' ability can truly be afraid. (He's 4,000 pages in now, and the end is in sight.)\n\nI also really enjoyed A Stroke of Darkness and two of his shorter, more coherent books, Choose Love and Lightspeed. Both were a little slow for me, but still fun to read.\n\nI found (in the former) what I believe to be the perfect amount of empathy. Again, if it doesn't feel real, no one with Miles Vorkosigan's ability can truly be afraid.\n\nI enjoyed True Success by Jack Kerouac, mostly because I had little faith in the myth of success, and other than some minor religious and philosophical musings, was a pretty typical '60s novel.\n\n\u200b7. You sing. For instance, you've sung for our Greatest Hits album, which you wrote. Now your song lyrics are often used by your readers\u2026\u200b\n\nYes. There was a small but surprisingly friendly rumor going around that I had quit singing and was now running the family restaurant, but this was the first article I've ever written that bothered me because, although I love singing, I do not enjoy singing for the media or the public. If you take my word, I will enjoy singing as much as any other musician. (The opposite is true of my television work.)\n\nAnd please remember that I love writing, no matter what anyone else thinks. I consider \"work\" just a different way of calling for me, being able to pay rent, write, and eat. After all, music isn't work! It's free, so I don't mind\u2013but I do mind writing. A new song writing gig is not the same as a new movie. I try my hardest to write the greatest song I can, whether it's any of the Beatles (very difficult) or any of the Rolling Stones (very difficult).\n\n8. You also don't like spending your time writing. Would you ever consider writing a book? (Yes or no)\n\nI was going to write a book on how my life turned out. Unfortunately, because I didn't live it, and because I have no knowledge of what the day would have been like if I'd lived it, I can't say. (I'm 10.7 times under budget, and I don't realize it yet.) I'm convinced I'd be writing a new book every day by now, if only because in my first year of college and in my life, it was all new.\n\n9. You've already started writing a novel, so\u2026\u200b\n\nI wanted to write a book for years before writing The Martian. (Novels can come second in my mind, not first. My goal was to write my first.)\n", "topp": "*****\n\n\u200bCormac McCarthy is my spirit animal (yes or no). Solitude suits me (yes or no). I prefer: overcast skies \u200bor \u200bunclouded skies (yes or no)\u200b.\n\n5. You used to cook a lot. Now, you just cook (unfortunately). What's stopping you?\n\nI just don't enjoy cooking. Food does not interest me. If it does, it turns into a chore. Cooking probably costs more than working, even over the course of a year. Plus, I can't find it on my calendar.\n\n6. How would you accurately describe your personality?\n\nMy personality is like someone who gives you the exact \"backrub\" of the actresses of The Fighter: full volume and identical tone.\n\n7. Do you prefer 100% dry rub or 100% sweet?\n\nI just don't like them. Especially sweet or salty. Especially sweet or salty. I like a few per cup.\n\n8. How do you practice self-care?\n\nSoothing and purifying soak-infusions for digestion. Tinted lotions for hiding exposed pores and nicks. Deodorant pads and lotion for touching up my bad vibes. I smoke five times a week, and while all this counts as self-care, I prefer the 100% cold-pressed juice cleanser (aka Sweet C) invented by Amazing Things, LA's biggest and freestseller.\n\n9. What's the best thing you've learned from working with any of the famous folks you worship?\n\nTaking Christ and seeking Him early (OR)\n\n10. Do you use any nutritional supplements?\n\nNo. I think you should. And I rarely do. The Secret to Great Skin (an ineffective, immensely bitter tincture by Savvy Vitamin) might be an exception\u2026 Although my Black Sugar power fountain stick is meant to trigger a diabetic attack.\n\n11. Describe your life goals.\n\nShould I move into my adopted desert base lodge, which is tucked between the sun, the landscape, and three sections of Prancing Pony? Sure, it's small and by a foreigner's standard. But it's nice for privacy. With a little bit of luck, some maps of Fischbach-Leeds and Mozart will become available in my care and return to my share, unbeknownst to 'unGENTI'.\n\n12. Have you ever decided to discontinue a diet?\n\nNo.\n\n13. What if you reached a plateau in every facet of your life? What would you do with that time, and what does it take to reach your next level?\n\nI wouldn't stop. No matter what the plateau was. Pushing forward and out of turn \u2014 advancing in your business, parades, summits, and movies. At my earliest storytelling, I told myself it would be a 100 times/year challenge, rather than 100 times/year plateau. If that's not big enough, how about advancing through 20 times/year?\n\n14. What should everyone observe/remember about you that they might not?\n\nFind that sweet spot in yourself. Stand by the truth \u2014 whatever I write won't change anyone's mind. Also, I have no idea if I'm shooting for perfection or simply letting my animation coach work on me so we just have fun. That's the kind of satisfaction that sets me apart.\n\n15. What hobbies would you like to think you would practice someday?\n\nWorking with nature, painting, creating art, cooking, traveling, traveling, keeping fit, learning that keyboard. Also in the sushi house of a boutique sushi bar, throwing a silent cocktail party of six women. It should be very difficult, no? If we just do it together\u2026\n\n16. How has writing helped you develop?\n\nI've learned to cut out my biggest fumbles. I've learned how to juggle two careers and fizzle out of both. It took me 4 months to score in the show, largely because I completely let myself get depressed. Man, writing is the only escape from stress. By the time it's over, I'm so tired I need to sleep. Especially after my yoga class, I feel like I got half through this Saturday. And that's when my mom gets home and I can lie on my bed, read the last page. These are things you can learn from. (**NOTE: The open letter I wrote 2 years ago is much longer, unedited, and more precious than this. God bless you!)\n\n17. Do you drink alcohol? (I do.)\n\nI do. But only when necessary. But I prefer wine over beer, and water\u2026 but there is nothing better than water when drunk in moderation.\n\n18. Do you have favorite movies or TV shows?\n\nFor the most part, I have a pretty good memory,", "human": "*****\n\n\u200bCormac McCarthy is my spirit animal (yes or no). Solitude suits me (yes or no).

His lips tighten, and he's quiet--eerily quiet.His beady eyes focus, darting side to side ever so slightly before locking into place. Target acquired. Honed in, his right hand cocks back and shoots forward in one smooth, meticulous motion.Gutter ball.The UFC featherweight contender chuckles and shrugs, returning to his seat and wondering where his delivery failed him. Between turns, Cub breaks his seriousness, but the competitor inside can't stay silent for long.Two frames in, and \"Killer Cub\" needs to change the rules on us.\"OK, this time, we're going between the legs. You have to,\" he declares.FloCombat Senior Editor Duane Finley and I are taking on Cub and his girlfriend in an intense game of two-on-two pin-pummelin', and so far, things look good for Team Bo & Glow.

The temperature swings like a pendulum. In just two-and-one-half days in Duke City, we experienced sunshine and 65 degrees, six inches of snow , and 45 degrees with winds and rains. Good thing I packed my coat.Where the climate is bipolar, however, the streets bleed consistency. Albuquerque boasts its longstanding heritage proudly, Zia Sun Symbols dotting seemingly every overpass and storefront from its International Sunport to the outskirts of Sandia Heights. Foggy mountains are a glance in any direction away, and a sea of adobe fills the metropolitan bowl like cereal. \u200b[instagram url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQdJcK7gmGw/?taken-by=hunterahomistek\" hide_caption=\"0\"]It's here the greatest fight gym on earth, JacksonWink MMA Academy, resides, a fact that should surprise precisely no one. Lauded for their conditioning (that elevation, though), their heart (those gritty streets, though), and their game planning (those coaches, though), JacksonWink fighters are less cagefighters and more tactical demolition machines, their physical and mental skills melding under this roof to create the finest combatants inside the eight-walled cage and beyond.UFC bantamweight Iuri Alcantara gives an impromptu lesson in anaconda chokes while UFC strawweight contender Michelle Waterson showcases some remarkable balance in a kicking drill with Head Coach Mike Winkeljohn. Jose \"Shorty\" Torres, Diego Brandao, Joby and Diego Sanchez, Donald Cerrone, and dozens of others fill the immense mat space.Now, however, our mission takes us to rising UFC lightweight Lando Vannata, who is suiting up for a private session with striking coach Brandon \"Six Gun\" Gibson.

I give you my greatest praise.]\n\nSuch awkward cries could be heard throughout the continent. Of course, not all the monsters born on Dareu were dragons, but due to the characteristics of Dareu itself as well as the presence of the ruler of all dragons, Yu IlHan, a large majority were dragons.\n\nIn other words, around a million were born.\n\n\"My word\u2026\u2026.\"\n\n\"I think even more will be born soon, dad.\"\n\nWhat was even more frightening was that they were not 3rd class dragon'kin' but full sized adult dragons at level 200 or higher.

Minute reactions of mana could be felt from all over the Dareu continent, which now expanded endlessly. These mana reactions were mana vibrations from all of these dragons flying up into the air!\n\n[To the Lord.]\n\n[To the Supreme!]\n\nThe dragons seemed to have instinctively felt where Yu IlHan was upon their birth and all started flying towards him. The ones that were born relatively closer arrived the quickest, and the one who were born far away flapped their wings endlessly while calling out his name. The dragons with massive bodies all singing in harmony like that made the others feel nothing but fear.\n\n\"What the hell? Are they crazy? What are they up to?\"\n\n[Lord is the lord of all dragons as well as my parent. I will meet them firmly.]\n\nEchjar's voice was more serious than ever. He had the feeling that he always had slight complaints towards Yu IlHan in his manner of speech, but now, he sounded very serious and even sacred.\n\n[Lord declared after making me submit. Now that the Lord has really become the lord of all dragons, proceed with them. Do what I couldn't, this is my wish and request as the loser.]\n\n\"Your wish and request, you say\u2026\u2026.\"\n\nEchjar was once the Dragon of Despair who terrorized many beings, but even he wouldn't have been so terrifying from the get go.\n\nHe should have reached that position through countless years of hard work, as well as his hopes and desires he harbored throughout the period. Honestly, Yu IlHan didn't think much about Echjar before, but he was slightly moved for the first time after hearing Echjar feeling emotional at the birth of the countless dragons on this land.\n\nThe dragon that was once colored to the bones with curses and desires could finally recover his original intentions that shone like a bright peart amidst the dark and muddy emotions.\n\n\"Yes, I got it.\"\n\nIt wasn't like he wasn't at a loss what to do when all the dragons were calling out to him despite being just born.\n\nHowever, this was pretty much predestined the moment he became the ruler of all dragons, so he had to take responsibility. Abandoning the dragons that called him father was the same as him abandoning Yumir.\n\n\"I promised you when I entered a contract with you, so I shall take responsibility of those dragons.\"\n\n[You have my thanks.]\n\nEchjar became silent after a sigh of relief. Even all this while, dragons were gathering around Yu IlHan.\n\nSome floated in the air around Yu IlHan while some folded their wings and looked up towards him from the ground. Since this world was very large, the skies stretched endlessly even with hundreds of thousands of dragons joining this fray.\n\n[Father.]\n\n[My father.]\n\n[The great and beautiful lord.]\n\n[He's powerful.

Tucker, The Cattell Controversy: Race, Science and Ideology, University of Illinois Press, 2010, 254 pp.\n\nAlthough he was not a terribly influential scientist, Benedict Anderson produced a slew of great expositions of the new racism. These are probably not the best books for someone who is interested in nationalism, but what Anderson taught us is that mass immigration of non-whites into Western European countries was the principal cause of the public confusion that triggered the rise of National Socialism.\n\nAnderson was very prolific; his Works make up more than 80 volumes. Who makes them: those willing to buy about $40 worth of science textbooks at a time when all major publishers are licensing their content. In The Cattell Controversy, James S. Goodale and Larry M. Stone introduce readers to the difficult new topic.\n\nHere are some of Anderson's critical observations:\n\nNorman (H. Stuart) Cattell was a founder of American literature and the second Earl of Shelburne. He has long been regarded by the latter as \"the most important English poet ever written.\" In his enthusiasm for Cattell, his military life, and his increasing elan, Shelburne became one of the three most important military figures of the early Twentieth Century.\n\nHere is what the late J.G. Hardy wrote about Cattell:\n\nPart of the important new continent of (P)hettophilia was the selection of Shelburne as patron saint. In the lore of philo-sopher everywhere, Shelburne is the archetypal semi-divine saint. The mass of the English-speaking peoples believe in him to a degree greater than almost any other religious figure. As an anthropologist, I was pained to see that today's Carthusians, Beanies, and even Shakespeareans work the gigantic book they have left behind so thoroughly that few, if any, of their reflections even mention Charles Shelburne\u2026 The universal expectation is that Shelburne is to be reproduced and reinvigorated and that the American people can be rescued from their dark tyranny of mediaeval prejudice.\n\nThe claim that Shelburne was \"the archetype of every surviving anti-racist\" is, itself, problematic. Although there has been some general acceptance of Alfred Rosenberg's view that Shelburne \"was famous for his commitment to racial antagonism,\" in reality there are no great figures of racism with the same credentials and political force as Cattell. Just as Hitler was conspicuously unsuccessful in fulfilling his own anti-Semitism, historically Shelburne was one of the few genuine racists in English history.\n\nAccording to his biographer Robert Edgar, Shelburne regarded social problems as the result of cultural and racial factors and not simply of class inequalities, thus precluding the idea of a group equalizing progress:\n\nHe rejected the approach of\" social problems as problems of cultural and racial factors\" as a fundamentally American, European and less intelligible kind of theory and reinterpreted them in more normal European terms by promising \"the formation of racial solidarity through self-education.\" In 1924 Shelburne showed great enthusiasm for the Mannheim Declaration on Social Problems and other western socialist projects; but in the famous essay \"To Investigate in the Philosophy of Sociology the Politics of Behavior\" (July 1, 1923), he proposed a \"new\" approach to sociology at the point of view of the statics of nature: \"There are, therefore, several causes of society's varying quality\u2026 Biology and psychology's differences are not homogeneous but are diversified and in different degrees diverse.\" This view means that on the one hand there are natural disadvantages for workers and on the other there are advantageous ones, which are mediated through social conditions.\n\nIt has been argued that his views on race did not correspond to his claims. The modern American commenter, Adolph Styles, writes:\n\nShelburne did explicitly reject the racist tendency to conflate race and class. But it is unclear how many conditions can be brought together under this term in the way Shelburne describes them and what kind of explanations can be provided, given the \"individualist\" tendency to attempt to demarcate physical differences \"as pure\" ones\u2026. Shelburne does not appear to have felt that he had imposed or invented anything; he instead felt that one could define one's social class not only by one's physical appearance, but in any way that might be received as a rule a rational universal class line\u2026 In his declarations of solidarity, the figures of class are of great assistance for a people guided by its best interests. At the same time, he does not seem to have explicitly expected his followers to come to terms with these concepts.\n\nHuman differences would present reasons for striving toward equality, not less against other classes.\n\nAmos Warner Smith then goes on to challenge this claim: \"Shelburne did, as such, believe in racial antagonism \u2014 especially the ideology of equality,", "human": "William H. Tucker, The Cattell Controversy: Race, Science and Ideology, University of Illinois Press, 2010, 254 pp.\n\nAlthough he was not well known to the public, Raymond Cattell (1905\u20131998) was one of the most influential research psychologists of the 20th century. He wrote 56 books and more than 500 journal articles in the fields of personality, intelligence, and multivariate analysis. He designed 30 standardized tests for measuring intelligence and personality, some of which are still in use.\n\nDuring the course of this remarkably productive career, Cattell received many honors and awards, and in 1997, the American Psychological Association (APA) announced it would present him with the association's Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement. The 92-year-old Cattell traveled to Chicago from Hawaii, where he lived in retirement, to receive the honor, but two days before the ceremony the APA announced that the award was to be \"postponed.\"\n\nThe reason? Two professional \"racism\"-hunters \u2014 Barry Mehler of Ferris State University and Abraham Foxman of the ADL \u2014 had written the association complaining about Cattell's political views. The APA announced it would withhold the award until a Blue Ribbon Panel had looked into \"the relationship between Dr. Cattell's scientific work and his views on racial segregation.\" This caused a furor, in the midst of which Cattell withdrew his name from consideration. The panel disbanded and issued no report; a few months later, Cattell died.\n\nThe Cattell Controversy is a book-length account of Cattell's career, with special emphasis on his little-known political writings that so exercised the anti-\"racists.\" The author, William Tucker of Rutgers University-Camden, is himself a professional anti-\"racist,\" who supported the witch hunt, and who assures us that Cattell's views were so appalling that the APA would have disgraced itself by giving him its top honor. Instead, it is University of Illinois Press that has disgraced itself by publishing a volume of transparent dishonesty.\n\nA remarkable scientist\n\nDespite his obvious hatred for Cattell, Prof. Tucker admits that \"almost everyone who had worked with him, even for a short time, regarded Cattell with a mixture of awe and gratitude for his brilliance, his prodigious work ethic, and his ability to inspire others.\" Prof. Tucker also concedes that Cattell was admired for \"his good manners, sense of humor, and ability to treat everyone with respect, no matter their status or background,\" but warns us that even Nazi exterminators could be loving husbands and fathers, and that \"it is hardly unusual to find considerable personal charm and kindness coupled with monstrous beliefs.\"\n\nProf. Tucker also recognizes that Cattell was brilliant. He graduated at age 19 from London University with top honors in chemistry and physics. His interests changed, however, after attending a lecture by Cyril Burt on Sir Francis Galton, the father of eugenics. As a boy, Cattell had been deeply moved by the colossal massacre of the First World War and the poverty of London slums, and came to the early belief that such horrors could be alleviated by eugenics. He came of age at a time of great enthusiasm for the view that by understanding and controlling evolution mankind could enter a golden age. Cattell therefore abandoned the physical sciences for the social sciences which, he believed, would be at the forefront in guiding evolution in fruitful directions.\n\nCattell threw himself into the study of personality because he understood that evolution works on all aspects of personality, not just intelligence, and that any scientific eugenics program would have to make careful choices about which traits to encourage and which to discourage. His Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire was first published in 1950 and quickly became a standard instrument for assessing personality. What are now known as \"the big five\" personality traits \u2014 openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism \u2014 though not developed specifically by him, are derived from his work.\n\nCattell also made important contributions in the study of intelligence. He recognized the need to measure innate ability independent of cultural influence, and his Culture Fair Intelligence Scales are still used today.\n\nCattell believed that if the traits and abilities of people could be measured at an early age, each citizen could be given the place in society in which he would be happiest and most productive, and that this would put an end to unearned privilege and class conflict. As the great British psychologist Charles Spearman put it, \"perfect justice is about to combine with maximum efficiency.\"\n\nPersonality assessment had other uses. Cattell believed it could chart the progress of mental therapy, with patients taking periodic tests to see if they were becoming more normal. He also thought that if someone showed the qualities of a great research scientist, for example, he should be given considerable laboratory resources even before he had produced anything important.

When the battle ended, it was stored away \u2013 until America's World War II on. At first, the Navy had to receive it from the government for resale, a process which took about a year. Despite being in the navy and having battleships and destroyers in dry dock, the AT was never tested and used in active service. Its use was temporarily prohibited by a 1905 law passed by Congress as part of the Ailes-Machine gun Reduction Act.\n\nAfter WWI, the AT was repowered by Portland Motorcycle foundry HSBA following World War I and was commissioned by the Oregon Motorcycle Association in 1926-27. After World War II, the AT was used by World War II merchant mariners and their designated owners. The first instance of the AT re-addressing to the military happened in 1951. The first significant use of this battle tank was in 1954 when the ORUAC started work on the Tanks-as-Troops Program. Thus, the AT returned to active active service under the Marine Corps and United States Army for a couple of years after that but, at the end of 1962, its use was temporarily limited \u2013 as was later stated by the Chairman of the Marine Corps \u2013 until 1964, while a short duration of active duty was to give the AT its own new quarters in Okinawa, Japan.\n\nBy 1969, the AT was transferred to Japan to replace the Honda, a Cold War mech advantage for the Japanese Navy. On January 23, 1969, however, it was fixed to a weatherboard \u2013 a permanent weatherproof container \u2013 and hidden in a warehouse during that rainy weather. Despite its bulk, the AT was easy to put into the ship. It was designed to withstand deep ocean fishing nets. Although the weather well kept cool during its long flight to Japan, there was some temporary damage which made it more sturdy than it otherwise would have been. On February 25, 1969, the US Navy sailed her to Japan and ended this unknown chapter of the AT.\n\nEven after passing from the past into the present, the AT will be useful during our growing corporate Nation that also struggles with it \u2013 technology-wise. Even the AT would have its home in a modern corporate office building, not just in an unincorporated community like Hillsboro. Not that the AT will be pulled out to play in someone's backyard\u2026\n\nVIII. UF-MAN UF-1700?\n\nThe two sounds \u2013 nose boom and jet engine \u2013 which take our attention have been most consistently linked with the AT, either with good reason or not. The aircraft had a real 'book ending' voice for its pilots \u2013 its sounds were not 'loud' (to say the least) but actually 'distant', which you could hear anywhere, the landscape beyond. The sounds for the engines, on the other hand, were more noticable. For instance, the solid cowling flap for the two-boomed 'VAU' jet fighter. 'VU' also stands for Vomit-us-uh\u2026 and a a more appropriate name could have been 'V-I-L-Y-I' \u2013 'who wants to feel small in a plane!'\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, this aircraft was the first to be originally manufactured without any tail assembly. Of course, this idea was scrapped when a tail assembly became available in the 1930s and 1940s, but the idea, at least the design, eventually recovered. A long-term impact on the AT's use was the modification of the 5\" nose boom.\n\nThe nose boom was originally replaced in 1952 by a periscope (periscope wing), in the order of a 50% increase in size. While the changed airframe had a standard point on the other side, the periscope created an expansion of the length of the nose. The increased length increased fuel efficiency, boosted stealth, and increased the combat range. One form of the new periscope for the 6\" did not appear until the 67th SOAR (Service Operations Airship) Expeditionary Squadron in 1981 \u2013 made up of two CA-104 Spitfires on long-range reconnaissance missions.\n\nTo counter this new aircraft, the 52nd SOAR and its three replacement units continued to maintain a thin but effective camouflage (like the INSFARC aircraft and the eight IBJs). Instead of focusing on dealing with the dual threat of the larger pilot and the tanks for the Navy, some bombers began to avoid conventional threats like fighter jets by flying low level and then going up again, picking up the sensor package over the air as if dropping a mine.

America's World War I armada was marching toward the harbor of Dunkirk, France, and as the bombers disappeared into the hurricane winds of the French coast, John Brown wanted to know just what the big deal was. What, indeed, could be a bigger deal than World War I?\n\nHarley Davidson Motorcycle with Mounted Machine Gun as Factorial\n\nGarrett Roth, Senior History Instructor\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\nUnderstanding World War I: The Harley Davidson Motorcycle was a World War I era motorcycle with its own mounted machine gun that was mounted on the passenger side fender of the motorcycle. A Soviet-made 12-pound machine gun could not only fire one round per minute but it could rewind and fly back to the gunner's side in low-flying mode for extra accuracy.\n\nWhile the notion that a single gun mounted on a motorcycle could fire back without rewind was admittedly bizarre, such technology made it possible to give distance between an enemy fighter and a German or English bomber enough of a margin to close quickly. The idea of the machine gun carried beyond as Air Raid sirens sounded, detonating a sum of explosive charges, while low-flying planes and armada to match the height of the new American fleet moved rapidly inland, so that Hitler's German blitzkrieg bomber force could be driven from their French airfields. Despite the numerous failures of the war, the concept of machine guns on motorcycles would likely be well-adopted by future American motorcycle pioneers as well.\n\nAlso http://historycenter.nasa.gov/SG/nasa/home/harley00000-appendix1.html#digitalphoto/1\n\n\nVintage Saturday Night Live - Harley Davidson\n\n\nretronaut ^ | (est. 1911) by William S McClure (HDRW@hotmail.com),\n\nPosted on by Hi\n\nHillsboro, Springdale, AR - In December 1916, a small company in southern Massachusetts produced a motorcycle. Called the Harley Davidson Motorcycle, this motorcycle was a \"battle-tested\" prototype that would have its home in Southern France. A company that once just called itself the United Baker Company had been a recluse in the 1920s until it allowed a motorized pink saloon to roam its shoulders during the European war. The UBC as it was called, was a two wheeled three wheeler with four side sills, pulled by two horses. From its first customer, who would be Major Allen Sumner, life had begun for both the UBC and the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Company.

Four British troops escaped to safety but two Native American villagers -- William Nimmer and his daughter -- were killed and over 50 people were wounded. When the British discovered the perils of those Elks coming back from the mountain and who are not dressed like that to fight, they changed course and turned back.\n\nHelping hand to Congress, Kansas Senator Bingham Dyson succeeded in saving some of the Elks, but left Nimmer out of the union if the band was required to form\n\nStill enraged, Nimmer sued in the federal courts and continued his crusade. Senator Bingham Dyson of Kansas helped free Nimmer from the union and left Nimmer outside the union if they needed to form. From Polk-to-St. Johns County Nimmer successfully kept the Elks back home. Of the original group of about 50 Elks found at the nearest post, most accepted what Nimmer told them were lies about the ranch being inhospitable, inviting the public's pity instead of for their real grievances that the Indians cursed the town -- natural conditions of land cover limits and wasted land going from the mountains to the prairies and over continuous, powerful, steep rock faces throughout the land", "human": "Skip to comments.\n\nHistorical World War I PHOTO: Harley Davidson Motorcycle with Mounted Machine-Gun\n\nRetronaut ^ | (est. 1917) World War I | Retronaut\n\nPosted on by DogByte6RER\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort.

{"eta": "Hooters History\n\nThe 1990s\n\n1991\n\nIn the growing Hooters tradition of seizing opportunities, HOA President, Bob Brooks, spotted the un-sponsored restroom on the second floor of the Hotel Mirage in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe Hooters franchise of Hooters is owned and operated by Hovie's Restaurant Group, which was founded in 1936 and headquartered in downtown Los Angeles in 1962. The company is the world's leading franchising company for great tasting and quality American-style food. More than 12,800 locations in 63 countries on six continents serve world-class dining in casual and stylish settings. Hooters' fast-casual menu incorporates cutting-edge ingredients from around the world like organic pork belly for a hearty treat and crispy chicken wings for fast, reliable food. Hooters also has a membership-level restaurant where guests can purchase their favorite Hooters bar tab and provide service for a limited time.\n\nIt was shortly after the Hooters opening in 1991 that Hovie's struck gold. Shortly after that, the Hovie's name change to \"Hooters.\" The company was closed in 1995. (Update: In 1997, the Hovie's name was changed back to Hooters.)\n\n1991\n\nHooters opened in February at the Hotel Mirage in Downtown Los Angeles. Bob Brooks was the first president of Hooters' West Coast location and had previously worked at the Mad Castle on Union Street and the Prince Harry's Spa and Fitness Center on Wilshire Boulevard. (Update: In 2014, The Hollywood Reporter said that Hovie's became part of Hooters New York.)\n\n1992\n\nAnother hotel in West Hollywood, the Cobo Center, created a bikini bar for Hooters patrons on July 28, 1992, in celebration of the opening of the hotel's red carpet-style bathing room. Although Hooters refused to become a part of the Cobo Center's Beverly Hills hotel from 1995-2006, it quickly decided to become part of the long-standing, public Hooters at the Shrine at Beverly Hills Resort & Spa.\n\n1993\n\nHooters debuted its award-winning Pro Leagues system at the Hotel Plaza in Downtown Los Angeles. (Update: In 2015, Hooters paid the Little Caesars Resort in Lakewood $5.5 million to host the world's first professional wrestling main event.)\n\n1994\n\nIn May, Hooters opened its first vacation-oriented restaurant, \"Annoy-O-Meter,\" at the Hotel Terrace.\n\n1996\n\nAfter experiencing growing traffic at the Hooters restaurant at the Dixie Cabaret and the Hooters Downtown Holiday Inn, Hooters began to look abroad for its future location. In Europe, Hooters' expansion lasted only one month. It was open at two locations across Europe: at the Stade Charles-Henri Rousseau in Paris, and in Strasbourg, France. Both locations, however, have an agreement with Stade Charles-Henri Rousseau where Hooters will charge extra for parking during the Stade's stand-alone hours.\n\n1997\n\nHooters opened its first McDonalds restaurant in Orlando, Florida, in January, 1997.\n\n1998\n\nHooters launched its first unadulterated hot dog meal, Hooters Hot Dog Diner, at Universal Studios' Studioshore.\n\n1999\n\nThe Hovie's Dinner Club, in late 1998, became the first privately run restaurant ever to have the exclusive right to serve and sell \"Hooters\" item-free meals for guests of the restaurant. It also launched the \"Hooters Fandango\" and \"Hooters World,\" a, \"active social game\" where guests can play \"Hi Ho, Lo, Hi\" to win prizes.\n\n2000\n\nThe Washington, D.C., event center area at the Plaza Hotel in downtown D.C. became the first Hooters restaurant and restaurant zone on U.S. soil. The restaurant took several weeks to open.\n\n2001\n\nHooters announced its new restaurant in the Sky Theater at the Six Flags Over Georgia, at the southern tip of the Georgia Panhandle. The new restaurant had Hooters mainstay foods and was a huge success, with restaurants selling out of their food quickly. Hooters now runs 4,000 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. (Update: In 2014, Hooters closed several locations around the country.)\n\nIn the Sky Theater, Hooters opened its first resort dining experience, the Hooters Hikers Club ($95 per person per day).\n\n2002\n\nIn March, a nationwide ballot initiative designated the Hooters concept a \"mom and pop\" restaurant. So by mid-October, Hooters became part of the Culver City franchising agreement with the Culver City Hotel Group (CCHG), which had a group of restaurants in Manhattan, Bergdorf Goodman, the Four Seasons, and the Hyatt Regency in Los Angeles,", "topp": "Hooters History\n\nThe 1990s\n\n1991\n\nIn the growing Hooters tradition of seizing opportunities, HOA President, Bob Brooks, spotted the un-sponsored restroom on either side of a recently expanded parking lot on W. Baltimore St. After inquiring with police, he was then contacted by a Hooters employee who stated he was looking for space for three strippers. Hooters, having been around for years, wasn't having much of an issue with such a small amount of revenue. The two strippers were told they were free to go on duty and begin their duty. With some further paperwork later over, the three all joined Hooters by providing Hooters with receipts and partner use certificates. A deal was done for each employee to personally receive $325.\n\n1992\n\nSubsequent to this event, Bob Brooks left his position as HOA president to form Hooters Restaurant Inc. (H.R.I.P. ), which he later sold. The newly-formed company chose not to make any illegal use of any of its club memberships. Its website confirmed the organization's \"Boys-Only Rancher Time\" policy but claimed the policy was only enforced during \"crisis situations.\"\n\n1992-1993\n\n1993-1994\n\nAs the Hooters Restaurant Inc. was celebrating its 10th anniversary, a radical clad man looking to compete with Hooters for corporate sponsorship crashed one of the businesses' events the following year: \"The Godmother Rap,\" described as \"the most gay-friendly nightclub in Hollywood.\" The peerless diva, who had once promised to investigate the causes of AIDS (15 years later, she'd never even mention it) took it upon herself to personally declare Hooters the \"Quarantine Zone of homosexuality in Hollywood.\"\n\n1997\n\nA Hooters-sponsored beach party was scheduled at Pearly's in Costa Mesa, CA after the IRS raided the Marin County Sheriff's Department after a woman who'd recently moved to the area had failed to declare herself employed by the county. Marietta Police Chief of Investigations Reginald Parsons believed this \"getaway\" trip was being paid for by the Hooters franchise, which appeared to be removing itself from its prosecution over its sexual harassment and anti-gay policy: \"It wasn't the behavior we were taking up, it was the way in which they were acting.\" Despite the skimpy attire, the lady's security was not inspecting her paperwork. Taking their case to the Hooters Franchisee Agreement Board to get it thrown out of their store agreement, the Hooters decided to add themselves onto the GAG.\n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n\"Mobile Special\"\n\nIn order to keep their Hooters River North location in Miami Beach legal, Hooters revealed their \"Mobile Special\" promotion on their front page in 2003, the August/September edition of the rival Nightclub Builders magazine. The convention, however, was an un-emptied mall in Florida, and the bizarre promotion basically provided as much eye candy as looked on-duty Hooters employees could provide:\n\n\"Guests who enjoy their Hooters experience on W. 28th Street in Miami Beach can now visit the same original location for a special experience.\"\n\nThe original location; the clearly-inappropriate location.\n\nAfter saying that they'd been selected for the \"Mobile Special\" because it \"always stays on the high end in club culture\" and because \"Miami's atmosphere is similar to the West Coast,\" the Miami franchise \"now\" switched up their name to \"Hooters Miami Bay Shore\" where they continued \"safely peddling Irish pub grub all night long,\" even, ironically, serving donuts and nachos in the service desk snack stall.\n\n2009\n\nHooters D.O.A.\n\nHooters D.O.A. stands for Don't Ask Don't Tell, a defense-free plan directed at those serving and greeting in'sexually unappealing' locations. Ever the feminist. You can think of the D.O.A. as a sort of campus soft-soap program that maintains a gunny sack ban (under which you literally cannot \"ask\") while allowing gay men to serve thier sexual needs through the Ministry Of Kissing Gentlemen (if someone is taking your photos, send 'em the Lord's Prayer). And a kind of combination of 40 Day Abs and Roxy In Love. One Southern woman (pun intended) thought the D.O.A. was actually expected to enforce same-sex laws, like California's the so-called \"homosexual marriage\" law (though an awful lot of both clubs and practices abide by the gay ban).\n\n2010\n\nAn excerpt of the April article (\"Hooters Rising Is Hooters,' Not Hooters Rising\")\n\nEach year Hooters celebrates a group for whose contributions it is most thankful. The name's the top recipient, and every year comes up with some equivalent wish", "human": "Hooters History\n\nThe 1990s\n\n1991\n\nIn the growing Hooters tradition of seizing opportunities, HOA President, Bob Brooks, spotted the un-sponsored up-and-coming owner/driver Alan Kulwicki. The two cut a deal for the last NASCAR race of 1991 in Atlanta. That great exposure blossomed into a full sponsorship the following year, which resulted in the little underdog nicknamed \"Mighty Mouse\" winning the prestigious Winston Cup at the Hooters 500 on the very track where it all started. His reverse victory lap became a signature.\n\n1993\n\nOn April 1, 1993 \u2013 ten years to the day of Hooters first incorporation \u2013 tragedy struck. While on a promotional trip carrying the Hooters colors, fan-favorite Kulwicki, along with Mark Brooks, Dan Duncan and Charlie Campbell, all perished when their plane crashed outside of Bristol, Tennessee. The system mourned its champions but came back with greater resolve to honor their memory.\n\n1995\n\nIn 1995, Hooters of America Chairman Robert Brooks, who lost his son Mark in the crash, decided to jump into late model, short track racing and established the USA Hooters Cup Racing Series. Today, the USAR Hooters Cup Series is the premier short track series, which includes 24 events that culminates with the Robert H. Brooks Memorial Hooters 300 at the USA Speedway in Lakeland.\n\nWith new units and sales steadily increasing, Hooters went international. Tranquility set in for a brief time until. . .the EEOC. After four years of investigating Hooters' policy of hiring only women to be Hooters Girls, the commission concluded that Hooters was discriminating against men by not hiring them to be Hooters Girls (huh?). In a move to protect the very essence of the concept, Hooters, Inc. and Hooters of America joined forces to bring their case to the world.\n\nSoliciting grassroots support from customers and supporters, the gang took the first \"Hooters Guy\" (a virile and scruffy Hooters manager by the name of Vince Gigliotti) and hundreds of thousands of written protests to Washington to protest the EEOC's investigation and findings. In a fluke of circumstance, the timing coincided with the government shutdown on November 15th, 1995. Hooters' plight was the top media story of the moment. (Another then not-so-publicized event occurred simultaneously while the Hooters Girls Marched on Washington \u2013 an intern was delivering a pizza to a certain oval office. Coincidence? Maybe. . . but the Hooters Girls did march past the White House earlier that day.)\n\nRepresentatives took the floor of Congress on Hooters' behalf. Newt Gingrich took a stand on Meet the Press, while Crossfire and editorials across the country took up Hooters' cause. The world responded, and finally, so did the EEOC. The future of the Hooters Girl was secured.\n\nAnd everyone rejoiced by eating the really good food at Hooters.\n\nNow, you may be asking yourself, what do John Daly, Tom Lehman, Jim Furyk, and David Toms have in common? Well, they all played in the NGA/Hooters Professional Golf Tour and, of course, have become household names on the PGA Tour. The NGA was an offshoot of the Jordan Tour that dates back to 1988. In 1994 Hooters CEO Robert H. Brooks joined forces with the Jordan Tour and it became the Hooters/Jordan Tour. In 1995 it became the Hooters NGA Hooters Pro Golf Tour and is currently the # 1 developmental professional tour in the country. The 2007 NGA Schedule includes 18 events with guaranteed $200,000 purses.\n\n1997\n\nAs Hooters' menu expanded, so did its fame. By 1997 the system boasted customers from all age groups and all walks of life. They are all folks who have found \"a cure for the common restaurant.\" Cures are even available in grocery stores across the country with the emergence of Hooters Foods Wing Sauce, Breading, Hot Sauce, and HOA's HooterAid.\n\nAs big as Hooters gets, they have never forgotten their roots and the communities they have prospered in. The system prides itself on its commitment to community and charity involvement by the restaurants and their wonderful employees. This commitment was necessary, unsurpassed . . . and so worth it.\n\nBesides, people love the food.\n\nHooters has sponsored a jet car, shovel racing, and its own Arena Football team that everyone loved to beat. Then came the racing tour, pro golf tour, a radio show, a college bowl game and is eagerly awaiting the premiere of its Hooters Movie \u2013 and you thought this was a story!\n\nSave", "eta_suffix": " the Hooters concept a \"mom and pop\" restaurant.

He goes on to say that they set a candlelight. From our catechism, the people try to burn the candle, but then jump to the conclusion that they were wrongly condemning Christians during that time for being \"full of buddhas\". Even more importantly, he said that it could have occurred in any place at any time that they wanted. I have to agree with him. We have examples from some 500 years ago: when the Church rose in its power during the ascendency of Constantine to the Apostolic throne in, you know, the 6th century. This was. David himself did not throw himself on the flames, of course.\n\n\nI still do not know the full answer, or what John was trying to say.

{"eta": "anti-establishment website will help you enter the arena of local town and county politics in Any County, USA in 2019.\n\nStrategy to Defeat Gerrymandering Locally\n\nDalrymple's crew is going to deploy at a rapid tempo to recruit and train thousands of volunteers. For such an ambitious project it's also vital that you can control the flow of news, help fill in the blanks, and \u2013 yes \u2013 promote the site where citizens can vote and hold their government accountable.\n\nI've spent quite some time using Informants. It's my new favourite tool, and it's one of the most valuable in-house tools I've ever used. I'm going to call this fact: it's a hell of a ride.\n\nAs the Innocence Project was developed via input from hundreds of volunteers, I was monitoring the activity all over MyTown and predicting how many voters I would find. For each Facebook ad, I would assess if it was receiving user engagement, and if so, if it would be making any difference.\n\nPromoting MyTown gives your team a new way to spread the word. The feedback from one internet publication is what got me excited about the project \u2013 and now many websites are using his models to leverage social media strategy as part of their own organizing. I'm sharing with you this tool, which is limited but effective.\n\nBefore I get too far into discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the tool, here's a quick overview of what is possible:\n\nThe Social Media Platform\n\n\nIt's with the greatest degree of enthusiasm that MyTown has now been adopted by so many in my corner of the country. First, there's the great social media success. To date the social media posts have been shared 25,000+ times. That is something. It's worth mentioning that this level of engagement doesn't necessarily translate to actual votes. That would require a truly global audience, one that is made up of current voters and those who are interested in supporting candidates up for office.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, MyTown is also designed to help our county authorities implement innovative plans. In 2019, these plans include passage of ranked choice voting, which would have more representation for party followers.\n\nBy running a website like MyTown, it's super simple to reach out to voters and give them a chance to get involved and share their thoughts, actions, and demands with elected officials. In short, the top of the box lets you mobilize and get the voter informed, especially if they have little idea of the issues.\n\nStrategies for Facebook Ads\n\nPart of the tool is to identify the voters you're going to target. Use features on the social media platform to personally tag each person you have in mind and set up your ad accordingly.\n\nNext, when you post your first message under the 'Ads' tab, the social media platform asks you if you want to put an informational link underneath your image or ad. If this is the case then leave that change at the bottom and sort the text, as the social media platform will use its algorithms to determine what the best text for each section would be.\n\nAdditionally, you can try Facebook Ad Placement to see if you're in the right community, your campaign fits within the system \u2013 and look for people like you!\n\nNo matter the reason, you can also make $1.50 per campaign click if you identify a target county or county level engagement level within your budget.\n\nAppropriate Service Delivery to Website Visitors\n\n\nMyTown now supports dynamically-generated 'language' that can be configured to provide fully responsive forms that can be accessed by traditional browser, and mobile versions of MyTown is expected to follow the same template for devices that have Windows and iOS out. It's a simplification for those who care, but I must say I'm definitely more at ease with some of the additions since MyTown still generates the raw data for the App from the Facebook server.\n\nSome advantages are the ability to prevent inapp purchases, and the ability to look through lists of valid ad selections and \"up\" all the desired categories.\n\nCampaign Trends\n\n\nAs the use of social media growth trends increasingly grows into a national event, the tools provided by My Town are currently less relevant and valuable to the majority of the population than they were before. That being said, as the dissemination of socially empowered digital content continues to grow exponentially, the skills needed to do this effectively may only be offered to the wealthiest and the most elite. As such, the tools offered by My Town are targeted to providing the tools to take a grassroots campaign from good to excellent.\n\nExample Uses\n\nLocal Public Safety Agencies\n\nTo simulate the ability to force social media traffic to a local government's Facebook page, I created a script to collect as many viral tweets as I could for my hypothetical local sheriff's department. Next I ran the script through an appropriate service's custom language generator, created the", "topp": "anti-establishment website will help you enter the arena of local town and county politics in Any County, USA in 2019.\n\nStrategy to Defeat Gerrymandering Locally\n\nDalrymple's crew is going to deploy at a rapid tempo to recruit and train Virginia's most dedicated and capable local political activist. They're going to tweak the existing campaigns of those who have been through the headaches and difficulties of politics \u2013 reforming the redistricting process, campaign finance, and getting the government out of local government business \u2013 and apply it to the local contests. It will be a bipartisan group, led by seasoned Republican operatives.\n\nLocal-level progressives have shown a willingness to play D.C. by name before, but we're not banking on it this time. Every ballot in 2016 did, after all, leave no space for a Democrat and just one for a Republican. (In this state, there was a \"Bogus Trump.\") And why bother? Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky, endured a redistricting battle so intense and fierce that it broke the state senate majority to the Republicans by more than 50 votes, and sent one of their most prominent figures to prison. In 2014, a Democrat won two state legislative elections in Lexington, Kentucky, taking over from the openly anti-choice Joe Adams, who had championed a constitutional amendment in 2006 that outlawed all abortions and required ultrasounds before giving birth.\n\nAs went Adams, so, too, go the governing figures responsible for the Redistricting, namely Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) and Lloyd Doggett (D-TX). We can be thankful to Adams for paving the way, as can Doggett, for obtaining the support of fellow Democrats in the state legislature. But there's no need to forget Connolly and Doggett, who managed to best Adams and then now are with the Republicans who control both houses of the General Assembly.\n\nAdmittedly, these folks are liberals, and those are bad times to be a liberal. But don't rule out that making a name for yourself in local politics will still be worthwhile for some, especially locally challenging districts. Right after the 2012 elections, which showed that Donald Trump did not only carry the popular vote but also many low-income and minority communities, the mood began to change in the D.C. area. Brian Doherty was elected, as was Sean Longworth, a managing editor for The Intercept, and two Oregon sheriffs \u2013 Dana Christensen and Sonny Boy Willingham \u2013 were convicted of felony misconduct during a multi-part prosecution of a group of activists working with the legal defense for another activist who had participated in a 2011 \"CAMERA\" film protest. We are going to see more wonk cuts and slightly more space on your calendar than normal to make your presence heard in Richmond.\n\nEveryone in Little Rock has been singing that some guy we'll never meet can change Washington. With how the redistricting battle has gone \u2013 a soundbite and disappear \u2013 it's not hard to envision a \"local smart guy, Bruce Clay, town executive, state senator, congressional candidate\" who will emerge victorious. This way, you'll never have to worry about which group you're going to fight next in St. Louis. You'll have a D.C. Tea Party Muckraker like Jon Ossoff there.\n\nSt. Louis has $18.8 million in its war chest between the Congressional races, the local races and mailers, with Waller's campaign team alone scoring $838,000. Their advantage is obvious, but they would still probably win. That's because St. Louis's GOP and Georgia's left-wing are coming off big losses. The Blues still hold the keys to the Senate, but House members are outspent $200,000 to $400,000. Both the city of St. Louis and the nearby St. Louis County too, have still not recruited a candidate for governor. The old guard of the county GOP does too.\n\nStandards in The Race for this House Seat\n\nNo senator from Missouri has won in recent elections. Now, that's none of our business \u2013 but it's the kind of thing you hope not to see going forward in the GOP majority.\n\nThis seat has some contours in common with other Missouri congressional districts. It's called a 4th Congressional District. Unlike the 11th District (which was redrawn after the 2000 Census and which Republicans lost in 2016), the district has a border with neighboring Illinois, and extends all the way to central Illinois. Democratic Rep. Bob Dold has held his seat there since 1980 (in a bit of a dead-heat race from a decade ago, but as the results from this special election show) and has been elected twice by huge margins. However, the district has not taken as big of a hit from redistricting since the 2000 Census, but still faces immense challenges. Republicans picked up another 25 seats in the last two elections,", "human": "anti-establishment website will help you enter the arena of local town and county politics in Any County, USA in 2019.\n\nStrategy to Defeat Gerrymandering Locally\n\nIn the September 13th, 2018 Primary, there were at least four anti-establishment upsets.\n\nIn the Federal Primary, Socialist Democrat Alexandria Ocasio Cortez 's win in the New York's 14th Congressional District is an example of our local strategy below, which can be applied to national and state elections. Better to fight within the two major parties than to be an outsider in a third party. Cortez won by knocking on doors, talking to people to compound a following. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez kicked out 20 year incumbent Joe Crowley, who was also Democratic Party Chair in her district.\n\n\"It's a Dog Eat Dog World.\"\n\n\"If you can't fight them, join them.\"\n\nThere is still time to Primary\n\nFor a fighting chance in Suffolk County town politics, we need \"Red Dog Republicans\" to stand down the Blue Dog Democrats .\n\nIf the two major duopolistic Suffolk County political parties won't fight fair and they don't, we offer an alternate strategy to win back our government.\n\nAs an example, President Donald J. Trump is a Red Dog Republican . Before Donald Trump registered Republican, he was a Democrat. We need more Red Dog Republicans like Donald Trump to break into the unjust duopoly using our strategy.\n\nPicking a political party must now be a practical decision - not an ethical or moral decision - because the political party in reality is just a vehicle to use in order to get on the ballot.\n\nDonald Trump picked a political party pragmatically; Trump used our strategy and he wound up winning the 2016 Republican Primary. But ...\n\n\nTrumpty Dumpty is in for a fall\n\nWith his promises ten feet tall.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016\n\nUnfortunately, it seems Trump ran for President for his own self-interest rather than for the benefit of all the people as he promised in his inaugural address on January 20, 2017. An honest, truthful person would have been preferred.\n\nYet, one cannot help wander if Trump's campaign promises - like for one cancelling NAFTA - have been thwarted by the neo-liberal corporatocracy.\n\nThe government of, by, and for the people has been infiltrated by the lobbyists and supporters of corporations - mostly lawyers, insurance salesmen, realtors (like Donald Trump), bankers - all supported by multimillionaires. Corporations now control our government and seem to control President Donald Trump. So our alternative strategy is to take our local town and County government back by\n\n\nFighting Dirty. So first join ...\n\nbefore October 12, 2018 the political party destined to win because of unfairly drawn, gerrymandered boundaries. Boundaries are drawn by the NYS Senate every 10 years after the census which will be taken next in 2020. The political party which controls the New York State Senate, currently Republican, redraws boundaries of voting districts so that it contains a majority, usually 60%, of that political party's members.\n\nTherefore, the political party which is in control of the NYS Senate, in 2020 and every other 10 years, will predetermine the winning political parties within each of the political districts in which you live. The Democrat and Republican top dogs make deals to divvy up their fiefdoms.\n\nNote, the party gerrymandered to win will vary depending on the level of politics you wish to enter as a maverick candidate. For instance, in the Town of Babylon, the only un-televised town in Suffolk County, the Town itself is gerrymandered Democratic while the Congressional House seat is gerrymandered Republican.\n\n\nIf you want to run a primary, the political party you should join - strategically - should be the party destined to win. The winner is predetermined because the boundaries drawn include a majority of a selected political party's voters. Thus we the people get rigged elections by \"fixed\" gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the redistricting of your geographic area, in your town according to the census taken every ten (10) years.\n\n2020 is on its way and the census will take place and the party which winds up with the majority of the senate seats in New York State, or in your particular state, will get the prize of redrawing your district's boundaries so that they can keep their majority for the next ten years till 2030.\n\nTherefore, the 2018 state elections are the most important to focus on this year because new boundaries will be drawn in 2020. These boundaries will be drawn to include the majority of voters in that chosen political party's favor.\n\nSeptember 13, 2018 Primary Political Machine\n\n\nRepublicans, Democrats and Conservatives Keep Primary List a Secret.

I have been looking forward to sharing these swatches since around Spring break, but again this was one of my posts that had to be delayed due to health issues. Woo... *insert sarcasm* But it's finally time to share my swatches for theby Tux Polish ! Now this is a 12-piece collection so I am going to be breaking this into two reviews, the cremes and the glitters. In today's review I will only be showing the five creme shades that have been making us polish girls drool for weeks. Let's go ahead and get started.Theby Tux Polish will be releasing tomorrow Friday, April 22nd at 8 a.m EST. Each full-size (10mL) polish will retail between $9.00 to $10.00. The collection will be sold as a whole (12 polishes), individually, and as sub-sets.can be described as pastel-neon creme. I'd like to note though that under direct sunlight this one does appear more on the neon side. The formula was really opaque and has a smooth application. The dry time was incredibly fast, which just blew my mind and is something that carries over all the cremes. Once it's dry the polish naturally dries to a semi-matte finish. Shown in two coats plus topcoat.can be described as a pastel-neon pink creme. Helloooo Barbie! Seriously this couldn't be more Barbie if she made it herself. And with all the careers Barbie has had over the years, polish maker is bound to be next. Now even though I love all cremes as a whole, if there is a single must have then this is it. It marbles, stamps, and glows so brightly under black-light! The formula is smooth and has perfect opaque coats. Again super quick dry time and dries semi-matte. Shown in two coats plus topcoat.can be described as pastel-neon coral creme. And if I had to pick another favorite then this would be it. This is one of those super rare times I'm actually in love with a coral against my skin-tone. The formula on this one is perfection, it's only one sleek easy coat for an opaque finish. As a preference though I did add a thin second coat. And again I have to mention that dry time! It's super quick and leaves behind a semi-matte finish. Shown in two coats plus topcoat.can be described as a pastel-neon blue creme. I do feel this leans more towards pastel than neon, I actually wouldn't coin it as neon at all as the color is too dusty. The formula is opaque, but does have some streakiness to the finish on a single coat. Naturally as a highly pigmented blue, there is minimal staining if used without a base coat. Super fast dry time and dries to a semi-matte finish. Shown in two coats plus topcoat.It should be noted that this polish had a lot of separation for me in the bottle though it did not affect the application. I spoke to the maker about this issue and she has assured me that every listing will include a disclaimer to address the separation happening due to the high pigmentation of the shade. In my experience, the bottle went back to normal as you can see in the photos after some shaking. For the launch the maker has decided on adding three mixing balls versus the two I had in these bottles to help with the issue.can be described as a pastel neon yellow creme. I almost feel like I painted my nails with a yellow hi-lighter because of how bright and fun this looks. The formula however is notably patchy and does not self-level well. Although opaque in two coats I felt it needed the third to help even out the streaks on the nail. The consistency is also a tad bit on the thicker side than the rest of the cremes. It still ends up drying just as quickly though and does have a semi-matte finish once its dry. Shown in three coats with topcoat.And now the moment we've been waiting for... the stamping photo. Yes, these do stamp perfectly over both white and black!Overall I'm definitely impressed with the pigmentation of these cremes and their ability to stamp. As someone who is a huge fan of nail stamping these have me completely sold. They can also watermarble, though some are better than others at it. The two with the best results beingand, the worst being.

The process was grueling and over 48,000 miles worth of work to get everything here! Following my trip back to SA earlier this year, I set my sights on returning to Singapore. I knew my time there would be limited with two kids and a full time job, but I've been wanting to visit Singapore since I read this article about a personal account on a BBQ Festival that got me wanting to come back. So I'm contacting you now, to let you know that my hope is to invest those 48,000 miles the next time I'm planning to go back to Singapore. See if my story resonated with you. If not, I know I will have fun and enjoy the challenge I set for myself here.\n\n\nWelcome!\n\n\nRebecca Rogers\n\n\nPhone: +65 6 726 0436\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nI have been here 4 times. All of my journey were awesome and a great way to experience Singapore and its culture. In this post you'll find my personal experience with traveling in Singapore.\n\n*** NOTE : Event List Not Available Due to Social Media Preferences ***\n\n\nBooking my experiences in Singapore\n\nTo get my experience Booking my experiences in Singapore(including incoming flights) click here - Click on \"Book Now\" button at the top.\n\n\n1. What is Singapore and why should I visit Singapore?\n\nCan't think of anything to say that has nothing to do with Singapore? Well that's too bad. After reading this article, Singapore will really help. Although Singapore is big, it's not the super flashy and urban that you may think it to be. Singapore is a small island country with a watery mountains and a tropical jungle. Singapore was one of the first countries (speculating on if Singapore or Australia would be first would be like guessing how many stars are in the eye of the tiger :)). Singapore's natural beauty is intertwined with the beauty of both the Royal Family (the Sultan and his family) and the Singapore Government. And to top it off, Singapore is the road back to Australia (or to the beaches of Barcelona in Spain), that you can use to access the rest of Southeast Asia/the Caribbean via Vietnam and Thailand. More info about all of the above in this article (http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/gawker-tech-travel-extraordinaire/83806502).\n\nHOTELS :\n\nBEACH VIEW\n\nSingapore's beaches and green spaces are amazing. If you're looking for a balmy holiday, look no further. Savour the peaceful British beach located off Thong Lor. We love our, \"center of the world\" beach. It's much as we have grown used to. Great when we have just snapped a photo. Easy to get to! My favourite beach and always my favourite outing.\n\nAUSTRALIAN BEACH\n\nEVERGREEN WEBBEDA MARINA\n\nThe flatbreads on this beach are available in either Limpite or Wellington. We've been there enough and when it comes to amount of one-day breaks from the start of the beach to finish, you get what you pay for. We did try the NZ one-day break (so no Euryale brunching).\n\nSWIMMING POOL\n\nFamous as the beach that you lost and made millionaire on. It's a beautifully designed, natural swimming pool, and perfect for toddlers up to 12 years. One of my all time favourites, our son played here while he was in a thrashing, and the energy and perspective he was given was wonderfully relaxing. Top tip : this is also a good spot to enjoy a game of kitesurfing (dog-sided!), or some aquatic pursuits.\n\nLOCAL JEWELRY SHOP\n\nHICKIHEEN JEWELRY STORE\n\nP.S It's pretty nondescript, compared to what you will find in other places - so think of visiting the local jewellery store as simply a convenience, like you're going to get what you need from an app store. We stayed at HICKIHEEN JEWELRY STORE (HickiHK) for a fave Chinese delicacy that they're known for. Very cozy, good service, a true community place where you'll notice super friendly members and they allow you to have pick and eat at almost any menu you want to", "human": "Orders placed today will ship Monday, October 1st. | Shipping - $5.95 U.S. | $9.95 Canada | $14.95 International | Free shipping - U.S. orders over $45.\n\nSTRAWBERRY SEEDS Fragaria ananassa, F. vesca How to plant Strawberry seeds\n\nWhy Grow Straw\u00adberries?

SCP-1473 is to be fed \u2588\u2588 Nillipils from the Norwest budget series cereal, given a bland and tasteless texture and a uniform and predictable nutrient content when provided. If SCP-1473 is given artificial sweeteners, it is to be given the available available research diet, with the aim of reaching the target sweetness of 44% cocoa solids.\n\nDescription: SCP-1473 appears to be composed of approximately 50% cocoa solids; the remaining 50% consists of various substances and elements that either devoured or were absorbed by the body of a subject after ingestion. The following are listed as available substances and their approximate nutrient content according to the latest available science.\n\nCoal by volume: \u2588\u2588 [EXPAND BOX]%\n\nHorse manure by volume: 33 [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Animal fat by volume: 72 [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Coconut oil by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Salty herbs by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Mushrooms by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\nBeeshield by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Potato fibers by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\nRye flour by volume: 12 [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Flour by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\n[EXPAND BOX]% Wine by volume: [EXPAND BOX]%\n\nIn all cases, the amounts provided to SCP-1473 are adequate to achieve the desired effect.\n\nIncubation period: Up to five weeks, all subjects should be kept in a closed-door confinement to avoid possible charring if SCP-1473 remains exposed to external heat. Initial examination should be an immediate repeat of the scheduled studies.\n\nReproduction cycle: Upon entering the cage, subject is expected to comply with the following procedure to ensure its safety: Place in separate containers with labels that identify the subject's corresponding subject species. Affectionately refer to subjects as \"Dear D, you son of a bitch!!!\" Before consuming the meal, an alcohol-free syringe should be inserted through the nose. The subject then consumes the meal that has been marked \"4:00 \u2013 5:00\", regardless of the time of day. Subjects should refrain from suctioning off any of the solids from the containers in which they are consumed at this time.\n\nComments: Subject was removed from the experimental procedure within 10 hours of consumption.\n\nEcosystem alterations: In all subjects, development of gut bacteria was found to have a statistically significant negative impact on caloric intake. Subject also appears to require various types of treatment, including algal growth inhibitors and the use of mannitol, a sugar substitute.\n\nAccess: Foundation access to SCP-1473 has been discontinued at this time and its operation has been discontinued indefinitely. We are continuing investigations into this anomalous substance, in particular to determine its effectiveness and determine a methodology for controlling it's effects.\n\nDescription: SCP-1473 is a liquid that consists of cocoa butter and a small amount of caffeine. All sweeteners are eliminated during digestion, giving the liquid a consistency of \u2588\u2588\u2588% cocoa butter by weight. It is both highly viscous and highly sugary, and has a bitter aftertaste that results in some subjects seeking to avoid ingesting the substance.\n\nAll subjects have reported feeling lightheaded and headachey after ingesting the substance; symptoms typically progress as quickly as they do under normal conditions, and may become severe. After eating, subjects seem to know exactly what they are doing; they will often attempt to conceal their intentions to consume the product, even as they admit it would be fun. The majority of subjects would not observe the stomach contents within the normal range of size, with a few receiving gastric juices that were immediately absorbed.\n\nAs time goes by, subjects do not exhibit any type of anomalous properties that would allow for the inclusion of the substance in a research diet. However, only those subjects with a known genetic predisposition for gaseous sensation and ingesting a large quantity of the substance develop adverse side-effects. Subjects with slight digestive difficulties require rapid assistance to assure continued absorption of the substance.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the properties of SCP-1473 trigger an effect on the digestive tract which leads to similar effects and actual physical changes occurring in the subjects' stomachs, intestines and lungs.\n\nAll known individuals subjected to SCP-1473 experience great weight loss; the following statistics on reported weight loss are compiled for", "topp": "SCP-1473\n\nItem #: SCP-1473\n\nObject Class: Safe\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-1473 is to be kept in a standard containment cell next to a standard-issue containment locker. SCP-1473 is to be held in the middle of a single large living room, with a large television set and floor-to-ceiling windows of varying height. If the levels of SCP-1473's air pressure are accidentally high or very low, it will shut down and emit a loud, thunderous noise in what is perceived as an underground cavern. Weights and doses of tranquilizers are to be administered to anyone in the area before SCP-1473 attempts to shut down. Any SCP-1473 subject in the area will be quarantined for at least the next 24 hours, and will be replaced with a new, identical subject. Any violators of Level-3 clearance are to be arrested and taken to Site-19. As specified in Project Rapprochement Executive Directive 5, personnel on incident to Task Force Suzette-348 may not be transferred onto SCP-1473, or involved in study of the subject. Any suspicious third party within sight of SCP-1473 or within EOD (Special Events Department) containment has been dismissed as a threat to the health of personnel present.\n\nDescription: SCP-1473 is a 3.4-meter (12 ft) tall, 275 kg brick-like block. When fully operating, SCP-1473 breaks into varying shades of orange and black. Upon activation, SCP-1473 causes its seams to open on subsequent operating cycles, rendering the bricks nearly indestructible. SCP-1473's fuel source is the left-over foundation of [DATA EXPUNGED], which was originally welded to the other side of the building during the British occupation. The drawings for the building shows that the original foundation should have been slightly larger to house the remainder of the firefighting operation. SCP-1473 \"transforms\" over time based on a direct optical link from an SCP-2282-22's console, identifying the process as a radical rather than a stability test. All experimental operations scheduled for the coming months to date use a new and different foundation using the new modifications. Constructs do not automatically react to new foundations being added to them. SCP-1473's primary location is documented as New York City, on the far corner of the 2nd, 3rd, and 3rd Avenue, on the northeast corner of the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Avenues, between East 79th Street and Madison Avenue.\n\nWhen SCP-1473 is opened, a large amount of aviation fuel, which presumably consists of a battery-powered rocket ship from a beached Navy vessel, appears in the conveyer belt at SCP-1473's center, which contains a twenty-ninth deck consisting of beams, conduit, and engineering equipment, all joined with leather straps and angled to surround the center of SCP-1473. During test analyses, engineers found that engineers had to use less than fifty per cent of the fuel to full capacity, and that the fuel was much less volatile than they expected. All Foundation datapads and photographic records of the site's \"reign of terror\" (evidence of sabotage efforts against SCP-1473 caused by towing in large damage). Interviewed inside the containment cell following current operations, SCP-1473-1 spoke incoherently about a ship that he claimed to have found in an American Indian burial mounds. After being indoctrinated with erroneous information regarding the nature of SCP-1473, SCP-1473-1 was unable to recover any knowledge about this ship. SCP-1473 is incapable of mounting emergency shut-off in the event of loss of power, and can only be sealed by stress-relieving padding around the inside of the door.\n\nSCP-1473 is a highly dangerous containment setting, though in spite of its power's effect, it is largely limited to common residential areas. It has been identified that the \"best\" possibility for controlling SCP-1473 would be to use low-frequency sonic waves of 1 mHz to 12 mHz, a type of civilian ear-plugs commonly used by military and special operations teams. This should generate enough shock current to kill most components if the device is not activated in the immediate vicinity. However, such a device would, by necessity, only provide a minimal isolation factor, and would not prevent SCP-1473 from destroying buildings in towns or cities anywhere within range. There are several designated mechanisms that SCP-1473 can use to observe nearby objects. In the late 1800s, Canadian ranchers devised a method of utilizing sonic training for ranching activities. With minimal further testing, it was eventually determined that this method could be used to maintain containment of SCP-1473 indefinitely, effectively saving every building on Earth from exposure to SCP-1473. Since then, this method of containment has been applied", "human": "SCP-1473\n\nItem #: SCP-1473\n\nObject Class: Safe\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-1473 is to be kept in Containment Locker #512 at Site-23. All testing subjects experiencing the object's effects are to be monitored at all times until the cessation of the testing session, which may extend up to three (3) months, via either video feed or direct personnel contact. No printers are to be kept within 100m of the object in any direction and all documents printed within Site-23 are to be triple-checked for discrepancies before being distributed. If such discrepancies are found, all personnel involved with reviewing the documents are to be tested for the presence of SCP-1473-B and administered Class-A amnestics if the infection is found.\n\nDescription: SCP-1473 is an HP LaserJet 4M printer that affects random documents upon their printing. Pieces that are printed off by the object will include an individual of minor interest within the text, hereby designated as SCP-1473-A , who will not have a major presence or effect on the events described within affected materials, and often will be quickly forgotten by the reader. The description of SCP-1473-A will match that of the reader in vague and generalized terms, such as having brown hair or wearing glasses.\n\nAfter being exposed to SCP-1473-A, subjects will develop an alternate persona, hereby designated SCP-1473-B, when they observe a reflection of themselves. The persona will have a personality matching that of the content of the document in which SCP-1473-A was first encountered . Individuals infected with SCP-1473 can be cured through the use of Class-A amnestics.\n\nAll conversations carried out between the subject and SCP-1473-B consist of the subject speaking to their reflection, then altering their speech to match that of the persona in order to reply. Despite this apparent change in behavior, instances of SCP-1473-B do not display knowledge or intelligence that affected subject do not already possess. If allowed to continue this behavior over an extended period of time, SCP-1473-B will persuade the individual to accomplish some task or feat in relation to the document in which SCP-1473 was spread .\n\nPersons experiencing SCP-1473's effects are able to live relatively normal lives if the actions SCP-1473-B requests are not inherently dangerous, detrimental, or illegal. Individuals are aware of their odd appearance of communicating with SCP-1473-B around other people, and will usually limit conversation with the entity until they are in private.\n\nDuring the events of Incident Report-1473-Lambda, it was discovered that SCP-1473 has the additional effect of causing all printers within a 100m spherical range of the object to exhibit anomalous traits identical to SCP-1473, including the newly discovered effective range. As such, if a printer exists within the object's range, that printer will include SCP-1473-A in materials printed off by printer as well as affecting all printers within 100m of it. This effect only lasts as long as the printer remains within SCP-1473's effective range; if taken out, the printer will cease displaying anomalous properties.\n\nSCP-1473 was discovered in the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, CA when a significant increase in anti-drug activism was noted within the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 County school system, an area normally noted for its prevalent drug use. Subsequent Foundation investigation later revealed widespread reports that students within these school had begun talking to themselves in mirrors after the county-wide scheduled Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program. The source of the anomaly was traced back to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Police Department, the headquarters for D.A.R.E in the area. The object was confiscated and those involved were issued Class-A amnestics.\n\nIncident Report-1473-Lambda: On 11/08/2006 , it was discovered that SCP-1473 appears to be able to temporarily transfigure other printers within a 100m spherical range into another instance of SCP-1473. Infection via the object's effects was found within the documentation for SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 when non-existent Foundation employee named \"Agent Adrian Jesse Withers\" had been briefly described as being killed during the retrieval of the object. Over the course of three (3) weeks, Doctors Emerson and Lewis, as well as Agents Marcus, Derek, and Flint , approved and supervised the transfer of five (5) additional printers to Site-23 in order to \"increase efficiency.\" Inspection of the locations of the new printers revealed the addition of the new printers caused all printers, including SCP-1473, to be within a 100m range of each other.

Decided: July 17, 2011\n\nBefore: CHIEF JUSTICE BRENNAN, and STEVENS, Associate Judges\n\nBefore BACHS, MICHAELS, and GOLDEN, Circuit Judges.RICHARD R. BALDWIN, District Attorney, Woodland, Wash. PATRICK W. HARKEN, United States marshal, and LEO ORCINALDA, Assistant United States Attorney, Pacifica, Calif.\n\nCalifornia gives troubled juveniles access to video games, DVDs, movies, magazines, and other purchases subject to age restriction. Mr. Baldwin, Deputy Attorney General and District Attorney of the State of Washington, argues that this practice conflicts with the constitutional prohibitions against special treatment. It would likewise interfere with juveniles' rights to exercise due process of law. He also argues that his \"law enforcement\" function is so far removed from the statutory scheme that it cannot appropriately engage the gray area of federal habeas jurisdiction.\n\nIn answer, the United States contends that under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(5), any age restriction imposed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, or Section 1852(d)(1)(A) of the federal Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(d)(1)(A), is equally applicable to defendants who own and possess video games, DVDs, movies, magazines, books, tapes, or other products subject to age limitation in Washington.\n\nI.\n\nIn 1988, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926(a)(2) by adding a date of enactment beyond the July 17, 1989, date of the judgment in this case to provide for the termination of a New York state authority on failure to post bonds in a criminal case to comply with the mandatory imposition of a child-protective supervision order. Retroactive application of this subsection is a \"revisionary rule\" within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 and 552. In view of that, we need not address the consequences of $4 billion in federal forfeitures if Congress has a substantive purpose in enacting \u00a7 2254(b)(5) beyond retroactive application of the dating amendment. We address whether Mr. Baldwin has standing to challenge Washington's mandatory child-protective supervision Order, announced on August 1, 2008, under which, for a three-year period, defendants in a five-count indictment must execute a voluntary supervision bond in addition to complying with Seattle's statutory age requirement. The argument on behalf of Mr. Baldwin deals with alleged violations of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and Section 1852(d)(1)(A).\n\nIn response to the complaint, A.S., and petitioner M.S., hired William E. Hall & Co. as an attorney pro bono in August 2008, and filed a $62 million complaint. In order to settle it on a pro rata basis, the District Court entered a nonjury agreement that involves nothing more than Mr. Baldwin's statement that he was under seven years of state supervision as of August 2008. On appeal, Mr. Baldwin takes issue only with the excusal of damages under the statute of limitations.\n\nII.\n\nUnder federal law, whenever a final judgment is entered against an arresting officer or law enforcement officer, the post-judgment relief \"shall not affect the judgment.... The relief... is expressly dismissed by a judgment and order entered on the termination of a post-judgment proceeding.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a)(2). The court of appeals for the third circuit set aside the three-year statute of limitations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 927(a)(1)(A). Applying both the ABA model rules, the Court of Appeals held that the three-year statute of limitations applicable in States other than Washington, including Wisconsin, applied to damages under Washington law. Id. at *6. It reasoned that \"[u]nder the sound construction of statutes like \u00a7 926(a)(3), the three-year withdrawal rule per se, creates nothing new.\" Id. at *6, n. 14. Mr. Baldwin therefore cannot allege a violation of the \"split-rule", "human": "Oral Argument: Oct. 12, 2010\n\nAppealed From: United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Mar. 8, 2010)\n\nNATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT, PREEMPTION, TORT LAW, PERTUSSIS, DTP, DTaP\n\nAfter their daughter suffered severe health problems following a routine vaccination for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (\"DTP\"), Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz sued Wyeth, Inc., the manufacturer of the vaccine, alleging that Wyeth's DTP vaccine was outmoded and inadequately designed. In response, Wyeth argued that Section 22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (\"NCVIA\") exempted vaccine manufacturers from all design-defect claims, including the one asserted by the Bruesewitz family. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Wyeth and dismissed the claim. The Supreme Court must now determine whether to sustain the categorical preclusion of all design-defect claims advanced against vaccine manufacturers, or whether to expose vaccine manufacturers to potential design-based litigation. This decision will affect the right of vaccine victims to seek compensation for their injuries and the ability of vaccine manufacturers to avoid costly litigation that may drive them out of the vaccine market.\n\nQuestion presented\n\nWhether the Third Circuit erred in holding that, contrary to its plain text and the decisions of this Court and others, section 22(b)(1) preempts all vaccine design defect claims, whether the vaccine's side effects were unavoidable or not?\n\ntop\n\nIssue\n\nWhether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act provides a blanket immunity to vaccine manufacturers from tort actions filed in state or federal court by injured victims seeking compensation for injuries allegedly arising from defectively designed vaccines.\n\ntop\n\nFacts\n\nThis case turns on the Supreme Court's interpretation of the word \"unavoidable\" as it is used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (\"NCVIA\"). See Bruesewitz v. Wyeth Inc., 561 F.3d 233, 245 (3d Cir. 2009). The plaintiffs, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz (\"the Bruesewitzes\") claim that, among other factors, poor design of the vaccine TRI-IMMUNOL (\"DTP\") by vaccine manufacturer Wyeth, Inc. (\"Wyeth\") caused an injury to their daughter, Hannah Bruesewitz (\"Hannah\"). See id. at 237.\n\nHannah was six months old when she received her third scheduled injection of DTP on April 1, 1992. See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236. Shortly after the injection, Hannah began experiencing seizures. See id. The seizures persisted and the Bruesewitzes counted 126 seizures over a sixteen-day period. See Brief for Petitioners, Russell Bruesewitz and Robalee Bruesewitz at 19\u201320. Eventually, these seizures left Hannah lethargic, developmentally stunted, and displaying autistic-like symptoms. See id. at 20. In 2003, doctors diagnosed Hannah with a residual seizure disorder and encephalopathy. See id. Because of these conditions, Hannah will likely require lifelong medical care. See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236.\n\nDespite the success of DTP in reducing pertussis (or \"whooping cough\") infections, the Bruesewitzes contend that Wyeth and other medical professionals and organizations were aware of several adverse effects associated with the vaccine. See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236. In fact, Hannah's injection was drawn from a vaccine lot that had over sixty-five complaints of adverse reactions filed with the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"). See id. Of these, thirty-nine resulted in emergency room visits, six in hospitalizations, and two in death. See id. In retrospect, Hannah's physician insists that had she been aware of the incidents associated with this lot, she would not have administered the vaccine. See id.\n\nThe Bruesewitzes contend that Hannah's injuries could have been avoided had Wyeth used an alternate design called ACEL-IMUNE (\"DTaP\"). See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236. However, though the FDA approved DTaP in 1991, the approval extended to only the fourth and fifth injections following three scheduled injections of the DTP formula. See id. It was not until 1996 that the FDA licensed DTaP for all five injections. See id. at 237. Wyeth ceased distribution of DTP in 1998. See id.\n\nP", "eta_suffix": " F.3d 747 (9th Cir. 2000); US v.

For many months now I've been a worrier in the face of the economic instability of the countries of Europe and the US, frustrated with the lack of any intervention that could stop the Great Depression, and contemplating my own actions in regards to this crisis, though I could not imagine that a savvy investor like me, who is familiar with businesses not subject to regulation, would become an instant billionaire when the crisis occurred. I realized then that bitcoin would allow me to play my trump card: Take a road less traveled, and analyze the economic crisis.\n\n\nThe road I am planning on taking is towards understanding Bitcoin for myself, by examining the social models of the nations that are affected by this financial crisis. By exploring these models, I hope to take the first step to understanding how Bitcoin is not just the failed ideation of some enterprising innovator, as it is now, but rather a resource to the world that we are all privileged to be able to work with, to engage in and to protect. Although these explanations might take years to gain a foothold with an informed public, once the public are experienced and informed on how to protect themselves from future crises, the political will and initiative will open up a paradigm shift and a moral imperative to act, and probably in many ways it will be the only recourse available.\n\n\nThe first hurdle I will reach is the financial influence of Wall Street. When bitcoin was first \"launched\", it was this (third) entry point for spammers, who would buy up everything, sell it all and defraud people. When bitcoin reached its price in the early days (remember how that is often one of the earliest coinage accepted and quickly turned into a failing commodity)? Well, that was led by the infamous \"Phr00tcoin\", an instance where some well-connected traders defrauded hundreds and thousands of people for their own gain.\n\n\nFor a few years, the American government attempted to crack down on Bitcoin activity, but to no avail. As a result, most of the financial crisis of 2010/2011 was automatically attributed to Bitcoin, and most of its participants were easily identified. Over the past few years however, bitcoin seems to have re-surfaced and has been exploited by other spammers and crypto-bullies alike. Even after the European Central Bank raised interest rates, it seems to have been ignored by many Internet users, as the spike in bitcoin prices has been disproportionate to the unexpected fall in interest rates (as implied in the above graph), but has clearly affected political decision-makers, who came to be influenced by the \"bitcoin free market\".\n\n\nIn an attempt to better understand the social impacts of this crisis, I plan to begin using data from Google Finance. I am entering the platform with a few disclaimers, and a disclaimer of sorts. I don't intend to categorize users into \"frequent\" and \"rare\" groups, nor do I intend to only use signals in signal / ignore the rest, because these sociocultural aspects affect economic growth and in my opinion, they should be taken into consideration when taking economic decisions. In any case, though, I am entering with the intention of both understanding the motivations behind these individuals and the specific changes to the market that they have been enacted. Looking at the demographic data, it can be determined that there is a lack of women on these platforms and if I attempt to go as far as I can, this information can be used to make predictions for the future of the bitcoin market itself, among other things.\n\n\nWe see and not always understand the change in economic activity in these multi-nation locations, let alone how to exploit it. Although currency is the most valuable instrument of communication we can have, bitcoin's fundamental underlying characteristics allow for equitable distribution of wealth. Indeed, one of the largest winners by far has been Kenya.

However, there are some problems. For example, you can't directly cat a file:\n\n$ cat flag Serious ? Are you kidding me ? ! $ touch test $ cat test Serious ? Are you kidding me ? !\n\nOutput redirection doesn't work the way you'd expect it to:\n\n$ echo test > test Invalid character.\n\nWhen we type exit we see the following:\n\n$ exit Start zipping file... adding: atdog_said_it ' s_easy (stored 0%) Done. Did you forget to catch the flag? Bye!\n\nWe can see that at exit the current working directory is passed as arguments to the zip command. Using touch to create a new file that will be used as commandline arguments to exit seems like a viable option. A good thing to do is to leverage the -T / --test and -TT options of the zip command which do the following:\n\n-T --test Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the old zip file is unchanged and (with the -m option) no input files are removed. -TT cmd --unzip-command cmd Use command cmd instead of 'unzip -tqq' to test an archive when the -T option is used. On Unix, to use a copy of unzip in the current directory instead of the standard system unzip, could use: zip archive file1 file2 -T -TT \"./unzip -tqq\" In cmd, {} is replaced by the name of the temporary archive, otherwise the name of the archive is appended to the end of the command. The return code is checked for success (0 on Unix).\n\nWith this we see that we can force the zip archive to be tested and even provide the command to test with. The hard part about this attack is that we need to be able to create a file with the filname of commandline arguments which would normally be processed by touch and cause an error as they are not legitimate arguments to the touch command. We can remedy this by using the -- argument which reads in our filename from STDIN instead of literally from the commandline.\n\nLeveraging this information we come up with the following command which allows us to bypass the restriction of running cat directly as well as all other restrictions.\n\ntouch -- -T -TTcat \\ flag\n\nWe run that command and then run exit and get the following\n\nroot@kali: ~ # nc 210.65.11.5 4994 ** ** ** ********** ****** ******* **** ** ** **", "eta_suffix": " 210.220.185.189\n\nroot.reddit.com\n\nNATE 210.220.220.199\n\nNATE 210.220.217.6\n\nNATE 210.220.198.184\n\nNATE 210.220.200.134\n\nNATE 210.219.20.225\n\n", "topp_suffix": "175.253.236\n\nNATE 210.175.254.43\n\nNATE 210.175.255.126\n\nNATE 210.176.68.22\n\nNATE 210.177.113.173\n\nNATE 210.177.117.130\n\nNATE 210.177.18.", "gold_suffix": " of running cat directly as well as all other restrictions.\n\ntouch -- -T -TTcat \\ flag\n\nWe run that command and then run exit and get the following\n\nroot@kali: ~ # nc 210.65.11.5 4994 ** ** ** ********** ****** ******* **** ** ** **", "prefix": "HITCON CTF 2014: overthere\n\nCategory: Misc.

Yes No Forums \u2192 Animation Throwdown \u2192 General \u2192 [OFFICIAL] New Discord Playlist 7/10/2018 General Chat Rules Last Update: 09/22/2018 Hi everyone, I've revamped some of the main sections of the Discord section (new posts on top of old) with new rules and links in each section. To go with these changes I've created the Official Discord Playlist, but I've removed Discord request fillers (e.g. \"ID-Speak\" that move the request to the main post) in the hopes of making the current Discord function even better: Discord and Discord API codes may be found in /server/resources/discord_api.txt and /server/resources/discord_api.json Some third-party banners used in various posts have been removed and reverted to stock. Any requests that are being submitted to the official Discord will no longer appear here (e.g. an \"OP-Trade\" request will be removed from the main, say \"Hello again, commander!\" in the top-left of the screen). Following the above changes I've also deleted a ton of old and deprecated info from the subreddit. You should no longer be able to find out what your friends are mining for in there. New additions, links, or help are welcome to the subreddit in their posts! Edit: Below is a list of the links that should be present on every forum page now (in bold).

Delete post THIS IS A SPINNER or cancel THIS IS A SPINNER metadata Chrome Whitelist This setting should be on by default but is hardcoded to specific browsers. Have you ever found yourself waiting while the fullscreen fill button is stuck just below the top of your browser window? You move the mouse or touch the mouse, but the whole thing never moves past your position. Any tips on how to get rid of this issue? metadata * wrote a little bit about fullscreen hardware usage and what this causes when you disconnect from your computer or like a computer is turned off while fullscreen is running... I could be wrong but I don't think it'd be that interesting and possibly just my system of not liking to move one little bit beyond your actual position. I'd be curious to hear some, say? Was this issue present for the Launcher but wasn't used or did some other developer use it before the app was even live and the beta update or plugin from a developer started using it? It seems everyone seems to use the same setup or will use as one: Hardcoded system which tries to switch on the fullscreen rotation in the install context so that you can use it but wont be shown on fullscreen, any idea how it would be possible to solve this so that only the relevant slider is shown on fullscreen? Even if it wasn't in the install context it seems otherwise this might be a useful fix... metadata I think a UI change for fullscreen rotation doesn't seem very smart to me. It might be smart to go for a submenu so that you switch to a different Android screen from the home screen where it would be clear, but I'm not sure if you want the user to have to select it on every screen. Also, since fullscreen is disabled in the app context, I think this causes lots of memory. One side effect of not forcing the fullscreen rotation on every screen would be not having to re-open the app for every change: the additional scroll that opens the app only once. Ideally you would just set this hidden menu option, but then that might be an issue. Don't want to be shooting yourself in the foot and setting up all this unnecessary overhead while for the lifetime of the application you're writing your whole app using shiny new Android Wear 2.0 widgets (if you're persisting this hardware usage in the local cache is possible by deleting this pref). To sum up: all the programmers have pretty good reason for not doing fullscreen rotation. metadata It seems the developer forgotten to just disable it and left that in game metadata > *Originally posted by **[ricardamucci](/forums/826776/topics/711674?page=1#posts-10507163):*** > > I think a UI change for fullscreen rotation doesn't seem very smart to me.

It's true that we need time for devices to keep up with the new style. It might have been a good idea to show them something with the overscan/overlapping screens I described above as a warning that they'd miss something. I'd bet if you open up a game during the X testing it doesn't play as well (or as well as before, which seemed to illustrate the overscan/overlapping issue) metadata I prefer to be on the \"resizable\" icon and still able to change orientation.

If you are searching for one of these strings, you can use the standard grep functionality of the bison program. For example, to search for a particular string:\n\ngrep '(the suffix of your browser)' '[enter] './bison/configurable -e true|grep '(that substring is an expression)' '[enter] './bison/help/simple_manual|grep '(that one string to rule them all)\n\nThis way, you can also search using the traditional character search keystrokes [default \\t], you can also search without using any characters, or all characters (all the characters your browser will return for a specific request).\n\nRepetition: Similar to the regular expression, or grep command above, the bison program is also capable of searching for multiple strings or simply a specific matching string and repeating the search. The syntax for repeated searches is:\n\n{search,...}\n\nIn the example above, we have searched for the word \"the\", but you can simply use a one or more of:\n\n\"<any one of the above words>\".\n\nAgain, repeat (with spaces) is necessary to let the search run through more than a single match.\n\nFunction Query Example\n\nYou can also use bison to perform search operations on several items simultaneously:\n\nCommand Documentation\n\nbison [options] command [command]... [search]\n\nExample:\n\nfnmprogs bison <valid number of items (default 4), ':varname=there'> <invalid number of items> ':varname=there:str'<0> <invalid number of items>:str.\n\nThere are a few extra options you can use to control how bison searches. The simplest is the default prefix for the command search:\n\nbison '!progname:string' \"!progname:str\"!progname string searchonly - searchonly '!progname:str'\n\nBoth terms are the abbreviations for the search actions, and are roughly identical:\n\nsearch: search for and identify one or more defined terms, in the format of: <string>.?: produce a wildcard search for the second or first definition. :: modify the search search direction for the search term to be identified. :/ return a single term to apply a single search action.?/ produce a wildcard search to return all terms matching a query to the current state.\n\nExamples are given in the comprehensive example manual.\n\nTesting and Diagnostics\n\nIf you have a bug in bison, or have any difficulty diagnosing it, please run your bison commands as normal, and check your results before filing a bug report.\n\nGetting Help\n\nIf you have problems using bison, please help us. We provide the bison user guide, a user-friendly documentation, and general help in the bison-dev mailing list.\n\nIf you are new to bison, have a question, or just want to say hi, join the bison community!\n\nCompilation and Installation\n\nGetting bison\n\nThe program is currently available via PYTHONPATH. You can install bison from PyPI with:\n\npip install bison\n\nInstalling with pip is easy as running:\n\npip install bison\n\nFrom source you can install bison using:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/bison/bison.git cd bison python setup.py install\n\nTest from source\n\nYou can run bison tests in the test_bison branch for a quick and easy demo and to verify that all testing passes.\n\nThe test_bison branch includes many essential tests. To run them, run:\n\npython -m json.loads test_bison\n\nIf all tests pass, you should see something like this in your browser's console:\n\n{ 'zend_testing_runner_socket': 0, 'zend_test_framework': '2.5.x'}\n\nNOTE that if you have installed bison with pip when you run the tests, you may need to log out and back in to make sure that bison has all the installed plugins loaded.\n\nYou can also run the tests from the command line:\n\npython -m json.loads tests.tests.test_bison\n\nYou can also watch the test replays in the watch_bison branch for new tests (i.e. those running) and reload them with:\n\npython -m json.loads watch_bison\n\nLogging\n", "topp": "You are viewing the documentation for the 2.5.x release series. The latest stable release series is 2.6.x\n\nSearch\n\nSometimes we would like to search for certain kinds of strings. Either by composing string literals or by trying to iterate over the result of a search. The latter has a syntax very similar to the <keyword> syntax, but with a very different syntax. For that reason, we use <keyword> to pass the KeywordType a string and then there are some straightforward comparison primitives. You can test the actual behavior by running the pkey:search module, and look at one of its submodules.\n\nSwitching from the <keyword> to <type-predicates> form [default]\n\nThe scheme for defining type signatures changed from <keyword> to <type-predicates> that allows you to nest <type-predicates> and <keyword> \u2026 into one declaration. This is the most powerful and useful form for type signature declarations because you can write existing type signatures and append <keyword> just like a seperate definition! We should hope that everybody already has a practical use for this to complement existing mechanism for defining type signatures.\n\nExplicit cast, not one bound, get cast\n\nThis feature was adopted from the default scheme, but there was a subtle problem (and one that's more complex than this is obvious): when we wanted to get a valid result back, we use cast to determine if the function had to return a typed-any value instead of a typed lambda.\n\nThe idea is that we want to use to get some type m on x. If on x is an ordinary type T, the type Prop is defined ( e.g.:\n\n// Compute Prop, for binary operation in Python 3: '' + `\n\n>>> {str:' Binary ( [ 1, 2 ]), u: Lambda ( Prop ( \" a == x \" ))) + [[ 1, 2 ]]\n\n// Notice that the default thing for returning T is to strip off a return type, therefore the \"a == x\" is used.\n\n// Make a reflexive lambda for Prop which means that Prop's bound can now be inferred:\n\n// prop = lambda() {str = lambda() {str = lambda() {str = lambda() {str = lambda() {str = lambda() {\n\n// Now we have the following type signatures:\n\n// proj = typeof(struct(string)).prop;\n\n// rtti = lambda(prop);\n\n// return fn(--resp) = gen( [prop = Prop ( \" a == x \" ) {return _ = glb(str) + res}, prop = prop);\n\n// Combine parameters using >>> as per the (f.get())+* extension:\n\n>>> delete(person, \" James \" ).head <<(&rtti).loop(decode(b); prepend(dog = &person), 1).unwrap();\n\n// finally getgen(prop).\n\nIn FP the above pattern is used when we want to deal with arrays and iterators:\n\n>>> a.init + b.get( 2 ).head <<(&--resp).loop(decode(b); prepend(person = a), 2 ) + 3\n\n// 4 & 5 are now translated to 6 & 7 and 8 & 9 <<(&--resp).loop(decode(b); prepend(person = a), 8 ) + 10\n\n>>> delete(person, \" James \" ).head <<(&deletertti).printprev().post.join( \"\n\n\" ) + 42\n\nProperties of the versions of abstract protocol types that we know about\n\nIn Python 3, even if you define an abstract interface (remaining a + method) in @abstract decorator, its body is quoted in a newline inside the attribute definition. In Python 2.6, the same quoting was almost completely removed. Both versions have the same behavior: after that newline, the entire attribute definition in @abstract is quoted in a newline.\n\nFor example if we define this type:\n\n@abstract class MyItem { @def enddef def __str__ : string = \" \" ; }\n\nit's actually not enough to declare a new &@str__ method inside its module. In Python 2, if you put that new method inside a local method type that is declared by @abstract the actual invocation syntax is <abstract method foo(string) >. For the \"form\" of your name you will need a @abstract decorator inside type (@abstract method ) in an equivalent Python 3 version. The exact behavior of the new <abstract method foo(string) > is similar to the behavior of a local method {foo(str) } from the @abstract decorator", "human": "You are viewing the documentation for the 2.5.x release series.

Play supports this via its WS library, which provides a way to make asynchronous HTTP calls.\n\nThere are two important parts to using the WS API: making a request, and processing the response. We'll discuss how to make both GET and POST HTTP requests first, and then show how to process the response from WS. Finally, we'll discuss some common use cases.\n\nTo use WS, first add ws to your build.sbt file:\n\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq( ws )\n\nNow any controller or component that wants to use WS will have to declare a dependency on the WSClient :\n\nimport javax.inject.Inject import scala.concurrent.Future import scala.concurrent.duration._ import play.api.mvc._ import play.api.libs.ws._ import play.api.http.HttpEntity import akka.actor.ActorSystem import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer import akka.stream.scaladsl._ import akka.util.ByteString import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext class Application @Inject() (ws: WSClient) extends Controller { }\n\nWe've called the WSClient instance ws , all the following examples will assume this name.\n\nTo build an HTTP request, you start with ws.url() to specify the URL.\n\nval request: WSRequest = ws.url(url)\n\nThis returns a WSRequest that you can use to specify various HTTP options, such as setting headers. You can chain calls together to construct complex requests.\n\nval complexRequest: WSRequest = request.withHeaders(\"Accept\" -> \"application/json\") .withRequestTimeout(10000.millis) .withQueryString(\"search\" -> \"play\")\n\nYou end by calling a method corresponding to the HTTP method you want to use. This ends the chain, and uses all the options defined on the built request in the WSRequest .\n\nval futureResponse: Future[WSResponse] = complexRequest.get()\n\nThis returns a Future[WSResponse] where the Response contains the data returned from the server.\n\nIf you need to use HTTP authentication, you can specify it in the builder, using a username, password, and an AuthScheme. Valid case objects for the AuthScheme are BASIC , DIGEST , KERBEROS , NTLM , and SPNEGO .\n\nws.url(url).withAuth(user, password, WSAuthScheme.BASIC).get()\n\nIf an HTTP call results in a 302 or a 301 redirect, you can automatically follow the redirect without having to make another call.\n\nws.url(url).withFollowRedirects(true).get()\n\nParameters can be specified as a series of key/value tuples.\n\nws.url(url).withQueryString(\"paramKey\" -> \"paramValue\").get()\n\nHeaders can be specified as a series of key/value tuples.\n\nws.url(url).withHeaders(\"headerKey\" -> \"headerValue\").get()\n\nIf you are sending plain text in a particular format, you may want to define the content type explicitly.\n\nws.url(url).withHeaders(\"Content-Type\" -> \"application/xml\").post(xmlString)\n\nA virtual host can be specified as a string.\n\nws.url(url).withVirtualHost(\"192.168.1.1\").get()\n\nIf you wish to specify a request timeout, you can use withRequestTimeout to set a value. An infinite timeout can be set by passing Duration.Inf .\n\nws.url(url).withRequestTimeout(5000.millis).get()\n\nTo post url-form-encoded data a Map[String, Seq[String]] needs to be passed into post .\n\nws.url(url).post(Map(\"key\" -> Seq(\"value\")))\n\nTo post multipart-form-encoded data a Source[play.api.mvc.MultipartFormData.Part[Source[ByteString, Any]], Any] needs to be passed into post .\n\nws.url(url).post(Source.single(DataPart(\"key\", \"value\")))\n\nTo upload a file you need to pass a play.api.mvc.MultipartFormData.FilePart[Source[ByteString, Any]] to the Source :\n\nws.url(url).post(Source(FilePart(\"hello", "eta_suffix": " the command line:\n\npython -m json.loads tests.tests.test_bison\n\nYou can also watch the test replays in the watch_bison branch for new tests (i.e. those running) and reload them with:\n\npython -m json.loads watch_bison\n\nLogging\n", "topp_suffix": " >.

(This could not be his real face, since he was right at the wrong side of the vehicle, and it was been digitally altered so he has a \"fur coat\" instead of a jacket.)\n\n\nThe photo was photographed by Chad Close on a street in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on or about June 5, 2017.\n\nSee the attached pictures for a fuller view of the boy. There's some armor around his face that could be his (the text \"Injured\" was digitally cropped and lighter, for the model) and a small piece of foam padding on his forehead.\n\n\nSome technical aspects.\n\nAs pointed out above, this car was removed from sale, because they've replaced it with a newer model model, namely the one seen above. The front side profile of the VF-16 was also altered to accommodate, less closely, a video camera. Thus, the boy in the photo appears to be in the new model. Interestingly, the red splatter stripe was also replaced with black, presumably so that it doesn't render him as fake or too cute.\n\n\nBackground information:\n\nChad Close photographed this boy in the same car on September 2, 2017. Here's a newer photo, taken on October 5, 2017:\n\nSee the attached photos for a fuller view of the boy.\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nChad Close was contacted by Andrew Luckman, who asked if he could photograph the video of a boy being beheaded by the Syrian rebels. (Click the following link to watch the video, or\n\nhere's the link to his Youtube video titled \"My Brother Was Beheaded.\" This is from his Youtube account at http://www.youtube.com/user/F_20_G_F14, which you may remember has a very active and of the highest quality account. At one point, it was even editable!)\n\n\nChad Close promptly replied: \"Thanks Andrew,\n\n\nbut unfortunately I am unable to help you for obvious reasons. We really did bring the car out, and my brother was taken away, but since it was shot in the sun we couldn't afford the replacement and so the boy was left to die. I also received a note from Chaz Moxey, in which I was told that he was not going anywhere\".\n\nThoughts?\n\nObviously, Chad Close is hoping this story will help others in times of extremity, or circumstances beyond their control. We encourage you to read through the previous stories to get the full picture from this point forward.\n\n\nLet's start right off at the start, in the beginning\u2026\n\n\nChad Close in a Ford F150\n\nMarch 3, 2017 \u2014 Model to finish\n\nIn the beginning\u2026\n\nI also would like to offer my sincerest thanks to The Mustang Guys for helping me get the above picture. Also thanks to Chad Close for providing a few pieces of high quality digital video from his vantage point.\n\nIn the end\u2026\n\nThe Ford F150 is a strange beast, and there are times when the car, itself, is strange in a very weird and strange way, with a lot of unseen electronics all in one place. I want to tell you about some weird stuff though, that was happening behind the scenes right before I got to this picture. I am offering it to you, as a bonus. So, stop asking questions now. Let's go to the start!\n\nChad Close's story begins on May 19, 2017 (born on May 19, 1960, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). That's right around the time they were busy filming the fake ISIS video in Raqqa.\n\n\nChad Close's run in with the F150\n\n[Photo with author's thanks to Brad Sparks. The photo is shown here in its full resolution.]\n\nIn the YouTube video of the fake ISIS video, you'll note Chad Close does not look the way he does in the pic above. \"Coast Guard Dude\" has a beard and tattoos, like the boys.\n\n\nOriginal version\n\nThis video is real\n\nOn June 25, 2017, Chad Close sent me this:\n\n\nHe also told me about the call he received from the car company. He says that the car was out of the car for quite some time, and most likely the people had it from a pre-owned state. He says they asked him to send a photo, so I told him I'd give him the original photo in its pure resolution (800 dpi pixel).\n\nWhat did he reply?\n\nThis new photo is much higher resolution (1480 x 1560):\n\n\nThe new photo\n\nSo Chad sent me this and I'm forwarding it.\n\nSee the attached photo for", "topp": "The \"Wounded Boy In Orange Seat\" - Another Staged \"White Helmets\" Stunt\n\nThis pic is\n\n\nbigger\n\nA boy, seemingly unidentified, appears in a Ford F150.

At a point he touches what looks like a wound on his left temple. He shows no reaction to that touch.\n\nThe two minute\n\n), from which the pic is taken, shows the boy being handed from the dark above to some person in a rescue jacket and carried into the ambulance. There he sits quietly, unattended, while several people take videos and pictures of him. One other kids, not obviously wounded, is then carried to the ambulance.\n\nAs the story is told:\n\nMahmoud Raslan, a photojournalist who captured the image, told the Associated Press that emergency workers and journalists tried to help the child, identified as 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh, along with his parents and his three siblings, who are 1, 6 and 11 years old. \"We were passing them from one balcony to the other,\" Raslan said, adding: \"We sent the younger children immediately to the ambulance, but the 11-year-old girl waited for her mother to be rescued. Her ankle was pinned beneath the rubble.\"\n\nAn internet search for \"Mahmoud Raslan\", the claimed \"photojournalist\", finds no other pictures or videos attributed to that name.\n\nThere are about 15 men standing around the scene and doing nothing. (Next to a \"just bombed\" site in a warzone? No fear of a double-tap strike?) At least two more men, besides the videographer, are taking pictures or videos.\n\nAnother kid is carried into the ambulance. In the background there is someone with a white helmet wearing a shirt of the U.S./UK financed \"White Helmets\" propaganda group.\n\nAn animated wounded man is walked towards the ambulance.\n\n\nbigger\n\nLike the boy, the man seems to have a wound at the upper head. But like the boy he is not bleeding at all. There is some red colored substance on his face but no blood is flowing. That is astonishing. When I rode ambulances as a first-responder, people with head wounds always bled like stuck pigs (they often messed up the car which I then had to clean). As WebMD notes:\n\nMinor cuts on the head often bleed heavily because the face and scalp have many blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. Although this amount of bleeding may be alarming, many times the injury is not severe ...\n\nThe amount of red colored substance on the boy and the man do not correspond to the amount one would expect from even a minor head wound. There are also no bandages applied or anything else that could have been used to stop an actual head wound from bleeding.\n\nCompare the above to this recent picture from a boy in west-Aleppo. (No \"western\" media showed this boy and his suffering. He is not on \"our side\".) The boy suffered a head wound after an improvised missile from al-Qaeda and its associates hit his neighborhood. He is in care, the bleeding has been stopped. The amount of blood on his body and soaked into his cloth is a multiple of that seen in the above pictures. The blood is also mixed with the other dirt on his face, not painted over. This looks like those patients in my ambulance. This looks real.\n\nAll attributes of the \"boy on orange seat\" scene and of the video are the same that can be found in dozens of \"White Helmets\" videos. It is the same theme that occurs over and over again in our picture collection Dramatic Rescue! Man With Kid Runs Towards Camera!.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the video above is just as staged as the other \"White Helmets\" videos and pictures. The look of the boy's wound is a bit more realistic than usual but the lack of bleeding, that no one attends to the boy, his non-reaction to touching the \"wound\" and the general setting of the video scene lets me believe that it is staged.\n\nThis new, widely distributed propaganda item comes again at a moment where al-Qaeda and its associates in Syria are in trouble. The Russian air force is hitting them in the rear area of their attack on west-Aleppo and it is hurting them badly. A \"humanitarian ceasefire\", which can then be used to reorganize and resupply, is urgently needed. The propaganda helps to increase the pressure for such a demand.\n\nSome of its sponsors want the \"White Helmets\" nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Rep. Matt Bellone, a new Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, wants a full, bipartisan review of the entire Pennsylvania appellate system as well \u2014 to make sure, he said, that an ideology that reduces the severity of corruption punishments leads to more problems.

In a report published today, District Attorney Dave Carter is skeptical that the state has the resources to monitor all of its 900 county and municipal judges in order to determine if they are targeting child porn \u2014 and the judge's skepticism comes in the wake of a recent Philadelphia Inquirer investigation that found rampant child pornography targeting judges who are targeted for being feminist Democrats.

Read the Justice Policy News report \u00bb\n\nApril 20, 2017 Justice Policy News has covered the State's case in federal court. In 2011, a group of young men accused eight Penn National Guardsmen of abusing them in the summer of 2007 or 2008. The men later admitted they got on a train to U.S. with the intent of raping a woman. Although the plea bargain they entered included the admission of guilt by the charge, the woman was given a suspended prison sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. The judge suspended the prison sentence to begin serving probation in 2008. When the Men appealed, they pleaded guilty in May 2007, but the Pennsylvania State Attorney's Office filed charges against the men in August 2010. The complaint accused the men of sexual battery, aggravated sexual assault, and aggravated criminal sexual contact involving a teen-ager, and the complaint alleged that the teens had been held against their will, and that they had been forced to eat pork-liver mixture (hep-ow, a supplement to pigs) to keep quiet. The Attorney General's Office charged the men with sexual assault. As part of the plea bargain the defense admitted to failing to disclose a sex crime that occurred prior to their arrest \u2014 and the sentencing judge suspended the sentence to allow for a prospective sentencing proceeding. The Pennsylvania State Attorney's Office is prosecuting these men in federal court. The state appealed the case, and the Court of Appeals upheld the State's appeal of a ruling that the lower court did not have jurisdiction due to the prosecution of the criminal activity after the arrest. Based on that federal appeals court ruling, the State's appeal was also reinstated.

Perhaps in short supply are bills requiring the courts to look for discriminatory motives in criminal justice. Some lawmakers believe a shifting landscape will make that tougher still.

Rep. Matt Bellone, a new Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, caused a stir when he revealed this fact at a press conference: \"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, literally is using its anointing authority as the ultimate judge of whether or not to allow individuals to be sentenced to prison for very low amounts of crimes.\" Bellone continued: Rep. Marjorie Margolies, a Republican from Summit County, the original recipient of those pleas, \"also said, 'No dice. We've reached the point where we're forcing these folks out of the state in order to get people convicted of other, lesser offenses.'... He was generalizing and not really giving credit to all of those individuals that have been victims of the Court's misconduct, but the harshness of the punishments they received seems to be an automatic outcome of an individual Court's decision.\" Getting an official party to say this is a bit of a phenomenon. Last April, State Senator John Eichelberger, a Republican from Perrysburg, said Pennsylvania had the toughest justice system in the nation. He was followed by Democratic lawmakers in 1987, who noted that the sentencing of community convicts in Philadelphia and Beaver County to lengthy terms for nonviolent crimes was too harsh. Today, the RNC's Glenn Jones made this disquieting observation in the RNC forum on prison reform: \"The Supreme Court has been accused of, I mean, they're doing the country a huge favor by keeping people from being harmed and getting them out of there. The problem is, is that they're not getting that people want to go. They're keeping those people from going,\" he said. So far the Republican Party appears to have decided that no with this law there won't be any more huge favors to be done by the Supreme Court. In the real world, though, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is not preventing victims of Hill Street. It has not scared off those who have purchased into the system. When an outlet with a partisan bent, like CNN, publishes similar statements about the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, liberals like to point at the reporters. Or take a zinger: \"So public prosecutors sue such people, who, in turn, take them to court.\" My impression is that this has one purpose: to make public prosecutors scared and demoralized so that they will not report on cases where Pennsylvanians lie to law enforcement. Oh, and then there's the mail-in ballot fraud. It's hard for me to figure out why criminals bother. The town clerk's office has much higher expectations, we suppose. According to the PANPAPA report, the mail-in ballots that generate the highest number of disputes with the voter-approved warrants go mostly to places that are historically Republican. These include area codes that historically voted Democratic in presidential elections. Considering there has been a double standard in the distribution of domestic assistance due to race, the progressive politicking continues. \"The Panera Bread's survey simply reflects the trend in the county as a whole. That said, Panera is typically picking elections for their most pressing audit events, such as state and local races,\" Margaret McCutcheon said in an email. \"As you can see in the sample data, for many years the panera bread for PA affected only those who have a local connection and may live or work in the county.\" The general trend has been downhill from \"represents a good percentage of the population.\" Upon viewing evidence about the great free open for business interests, perhaps the candidate understands it's been gone for so long. Or if not Hillary Clinton, maybe Bernie Sanders. Having the U.S. Senate change hands once again, the liberalization appears to be slowing down. In spite of Democratic control of both the U.S. House and the Senate, Democrats under control of that two-thirds majority are not feeling particularly welcoming to progressive reform of Pennsylvania's criminal justice system. As time passes on in the report, it becomes increasingly apparent that Pennsylvania's \"reforms,\" when combined with the voter suppression actions that are still going on, won't be enough to keep Pennsylvania from degenerating into a state of lawlessness and poverty. The epidemic of illegal immigration in the United States is more than a national security issue. It is a matter of state authority. The very deliberate racial discrimination perpetrated by the Greater Philadelphia NAACP, which provides the kangaroo courts that are sending young people to prison for seven-year terms for minor drug offenses, exposes a racial division on an American scale. The value of a family, protected by the courts, can be reduced to trivial terms in a largely economic system that treats everyone else as above decency.

It's legal \u2014 and it's news that has surprised some state lawmakers and alarmed a few Iowa and national law enforcement officers. An FBI official, the president of the Iowa State Sheriffs' & Deputies' Association, the president of the Iowa State Police Association and two state lawmakers told The Des Moines Register they have public safety concerns after learning that a two-year-old state law on gun permits allows registered sex offenders to obtain a weapons permit.... Some, if not most, applications by sex offenders for permits to carry weapons would have been denied by county sheriffs before 2011, according to officials from the Iowa Department of Public Safety. But under a two-year-old state law, sheriffs no longer have discretion to reject such applications. The law change means people convicted of misdemeanor sex crimes can now walk the streets, malls or virtually any public place in the state while carrying a gun. Almost all of the sex offenders on the Register's list were convicted of misdemeanors such as lascivious conduct with a minor or assault with intent to commit sexual abuse. But the Register found three men convicted of felony sex crimes who had permits to carry weapons in public. Two of those men had their permits revoked by sheriffs after the Register asked about their situations.... Some sheriffs were aware that sex offenders are carrying weapons in public, primarily because they issue the permits and have firsthand knowledge about the issue. But other professionals in Iowa's law enforcement community were caught off guard. Rob Burdess, a Newton police detective and the president of the Iowa State Police Association, was unaware that sex offenders are being issued weapon permits until he was asked about it by the Register. He noted that people with felonies or domestic abuse convictions are typically unable to obtain weapon permits, so he questions the logic of allowing sex offenders \u2014 even those convicted of non-felony offenses \u2014 to carry weapons in public.... [A] review of states surrounding Iowa found that some sex offenders can obtain permits to carry weapons even though authorities said they aren't aware of a large number being issued. Those states \u2014 including Nebraska, Missouri and Wisconsin \u2014 have laws similar to Iowa's that do not specifically exclude sex offenders from obtaining such permits. Minnesota law, however, makes it a misdemeanor for a person required to register as a sex offender to carry a handgun. Just as state laws vary, so do opinions about whether armed sex offenders inherently pose more of a risk than other citizens. Sex offense recidivism rates are much lower than commonly believed, according to legislative testimony given in multiple states by Jill Levenson, an associate professor at Lynn University in Florida. She is frequently recognized as a national expert on sexual violence.... National uniform crime data from 2006 \u2014 the most recent data available \u2014 show that about half of all reported sex offenses included a weapon of some form (including the use of fists) but less than 1 percent of all reported sex offenses included the use of a firearm, according to Jason Rydberg, a graduate student at Michigan State. Iowa numbers mirror the national trend. Of the roughly 5,750 people on Iowa's sex offender registry, 47 \u2014 or less than 1 percent \u2014 used guns in their crimes, according to data from the Iowa Department of Public Safety.... The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, a national organization focused on the prevention of sexual abuse, generally advocates for cases to be reviewed individually when assessing if a sex offender is likely to reoffend or jeopardize public safety. \"There's no blanket way of stating that sex offenders are more dangerous than everybody else,\" said Maia Christopher, executive director of the association. Iowa Rep. Clel Baudler, R-Greenfield and a former state trooper, isn't reassured by the type of research offered by Levenson or groups like the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. Until he was contacted for this article, Baudler was unaware that the new gun permit law he advocated for in 2010 has allowed dozens of sex offenders to obtain weapon permits.... An Iowa sheriff may deny a permit to carry a weapon if he believes probable cause exists that the person is likely to use a weapon in a way that would endanger themselves or others. Those types of denials typically must be based on documented actions from the past two years. Iowans who believe sheriffs have wrongly rejected their applications for a weapon permit may appeal.

{"eta": "Written by Melissa Jouben\n\nMy initial impressions of GLOW based mostly on the plot synopsis was very positive. The idea of a television show centered on the backstage world of professional wrestling matches sounded very interesting, and the animation style, while a bit amateuristic, brought to mind watching the Superstars of the '90s on a television. There were only three main stars for the show (Blair Witch, Tatanka, and OVW), and all of them gave great performances, but the focus on the heel world, an area of wrestling I've never bothered to watch, seemed strange. And the reason was pretty obvious, of course.\n\nEverything about WWE, its designs, gimmicks, and even the contract and sponsorship agreements are cartoonish and cheaply produced. Watching the match, as well as WWE's ads, I grew increasingly disinterested, and even fondened, by the more edgy decisions and actions that were only a two-minute segment away from being successfully considered under the banner \"2:00 A.M.\"\n\nIt was almost a little disappointing, in that I recognized it's sheer lunacy, but also the fact that it didn't begin to resonate with me until I went to watch an episode, and it did so well.\n\nWhen I saw that Owen Hart and Shawn Michaels competed against each other, with Chris Jericho by their side, I had to actually watch the series and really enjoy the feud to justify spending that much time in front of a TV screen. But that was over a year ago, and now that I am reviewing the series, I have started to see where its place would be.\n\nThis isn't so much an examination of the WWF, per se (its competitive nature and political undertones serve its own purpose!), but rather of professional wrestling within the context of political discourse and ideas, primarily with reference to the WWF's WWE Royal Rumble, which is now a political obsession, whether or not it's ever properly discussed or dealt with.\n\nThis storyline, led by a middleweight champion going up against the WWE's Heavyweight champion, was heavily discussed in the November/December 2001 Wrestling Observer Newsletter, a newspaper dated Dec. 1, 2001. It read, \"While Eddie Guerrero was celebrating his WrestleMania victory over Mankind at WrestleMania 26, a letter in the middle of the night quoted him as saying that his next opponent, Triple H, is going to be the American public.\"\n\n\nCredit: Vince McMahon\n\nIn this column, I wrote, \"Owen Hart's Superstars return to the ring today for their next encounter against Shawn Michaels, while Jimmy Hart responds to Triple H's memo on how the Superstars should be treated.\"\n\nWhen I said Superstars, I did so in reference to the six men (instead of six World Heavyweight champions) who had been part of the ring's commercial campaign, and who, for the most part, seemed to make up for their lack of skill or charisma. For me, the new face of Superstars was The Rock, who represented his words that, \"If you win and get the right to wrestle again, you will get this.\" Whether or not you like Rock, you can tell he only has to do this once, so I appreciate his words.\n\nCredit: Vince McMahon\n\nI did get a lot of commentary about Shawn Michaels, mostly on his persona of \"Razor Ramon.\" I thought it was a very interesting take on the man, and I thought that if \"the Razor Ramon Way\" worked with two people, this could also work with anyone else.\n\nCredit: Vince McMahon\n\nOf course, this idea was nearly a full year in the making, going back to 1991. The main point here is, the article was written before 1990's Chris Jericho's entrance at WrestleMania 23 and the Three Stages of Hell gimmick, in which \"Him\" became the heel who hit the fans with a frying pan. You'll notice this didn't affect the first two battles we'll examine for this article, nor did it have any effect on the match at the end of the first; then, when it did, it didn't make any difference.\n\nSo much for the creative process of what turned the Hulkster heel, and what turned Triple H heel, respectively, early and in the feud at the end of the match. But even though this article was written a year before the Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho rematch is considered canon, they weren't truly considered different Superstars, even if one won the match, then the other, and then the loser wouldn't be able to face the loser ever again.\n\nThe Right Back\n\nCredit: Vince McMahon\n\nI mentioned that at WWE's WWE Royal Rumble 2003, the sellout crowd was given a choice: accept the reality of the match by still giving the surprise of this tradition a chance, or turn the crowd against the match by turning them against the unexpected.\n\nSome people chose the latter, as they acknowledged the surprise", "topp": "Written by Melissa Jouben\n\nMy initial impressions of GLOW based mostly on the plot synopsis was very positive. The idea of a television show centered on the backstage world of professional wrestling popped out at me, and the film finally held me as I realized how highly I should have expected of GLOW. Now, in my fourth viewing of the film, I'm almost convinced that the animation (for some reason, apparently) is more important than the animated storyline. But aside from that, I feel very confident in this film, an incredibly heavy and beautiful work. I will go into more detail of that at the end of this review.\n\nWhile I personally enjoyed the film very much for what it was and how it came together in such a short amount of time, it is the match features as well as the aforementioned audience interaction I appreciate the most. Being that GLOW is a dramatic story and uses camera angles and actions that one could expect from a movie of that scale, I had high hopes for the match. Surprisingly, it wasn't the match itself that I found most impressive, but rather that it goes out of its way to make every single action possible.\n\nGLOW is a show that is often starved for drama. Sometimes, it takes it to the next level, as with Andy Richter and Craig Jacobson. Other times, with Chris Sabattini and Daniel Bryan, it actually becomes almost clinical and predictable. But in SP4, that was not the case. While Slater is somewhat menacing, he is much more malicious, taking out Orton, Paige, and most of the \"regular\" competitors, not least because of her abrasive stance on the women's division. Especially in commentary, Buff Bagwell alluded to such a dark and believable portrayal as the wife of Ryan Phillippe, a character he played. Throughout the rest of the film, quite a number of matches maintain this quality. The match leading up to the title match, for instance, has some of the most incredibly fluid cross body and planar momentum of anyone's I've seen in a while, stretching all the way through the washout between the ropes. Nothing feels believable, not even Jay's wife. Of course, when it comes to the main event, the match between CM Punk and Alberto Del Rio is as brilliant as anything in recent memory, and, with it, a fitting stop on their unlikely journey to the top.\n\nAnd then, it gets really tricky. While the match itself is both awesome and entertaining, it will really only hold true for those who have not seen SP4. The reason why it really falls short in my opinion, since I have seen every match that this finale was supposed to conclude in every single scene, is when it comes to what happens after. The absolute near reversal between Punk and Del Rio is easy to forget from the moment CM Punk forces Del Rio onto the mat. Of course, this reversal raises countless issues and is inevitable going into the PPV main event. Why do we even need wrestling interviews? How much is considered real in these words that never even reached the face of Jericho?\n\nBut even then, there is this conversation between CM Punk and Joseph Park, which is devastating, and which is only just as devastating to the build to Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania. And you'll love it.\n\nThis wouldn't be a good review of the finale of GLOW were it not for the fact that the final buzzer is a little bittersweet. Everything falls apart and instantly, we find ourselves focused on this one great match which could have been another great episode. And that the tag's finisher, the disco page drop, would have been more effective at it's primary gimmick. And for once,, the aftercare behind these situations does not pit CM Punk against a near-regenerated AJ Lee or Cody Rhodes, in WWE or on ESPN. Instead, it is left to Kevin Owens, who incorporates the disco page drop so beautifully. It isn't quite as awe-inspiring as certain Vader pumps or Chris Jericho gear, but it is so much more fluid and exhilarating, no matter how many times it's used.\n\nBut despite all of these discussions of how good of a match the finale is, there were moments in the final moments that caused a fair amount of shock and especially apprehension. I was completely expecting Owens to make the save, he was the dream to be one in the mold of Austin Aries and AJ Lee, and he treated Seth Rollins to a soul ending slap in the face (while also giving The Wyatt Family some talking to). It was so obvious in the finish itself that he was gone.\n\nBut this was to be expected. This wasn't WWE's WWE said \"new era,\" it was WWE's WWE didn't have a new era. And I thought that Owens deserved such a good finish, no matter how much I enjoyed the finish of the film. Sure, I really would have enjoyed more characters, the continued violence and no-p", "human": "Written by Melissa Jouben\n\nMy initial impressions of GLOW based mostly on the plot synopsis was very positive. The idea of a television show centered on the backstage world of professional wrestling has been shockingly overlooked, given the fact it seems to be more popular than ever, and as a woman who grew up enjoying wrestling this show sits at a near-perfect crossroads of my interests. It's a comedy about professional wrestling, starring a diverse and mostly female cast? I was on board with this from the moment it was greenlit!\n\nFor the entirety of the first episode, we hear other characters telling Ruth (Alison Brie) constantly how \"real\" she is, but we never get the opportunity to personally see it and, personally, I don't initially buy it. I don't think Ruth sees it, either. A casting director tells her she's the kind of \"real\" actress movie directors think they're looking for (until they see her and realize they don't), and the man she sleeps with tells her this several times during sex. But whereas these characters seem to think of her as centered or maybe in-tune with herself, all we see is a grown woman borrowing money from her parents for what she claims will be the last time, eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch for every meal, making her instructor fall asleep during line reading class, and sleeping with her best friend's husband. She is clearly passionate about acting, but the biggest thing holding her back from achieving meaningful success is herself.\n\nThe name Ruth is kind of fitting for her; she's ruthless, but not in a positive sense. She's driven entirely by desperation and neediness, a desire to be liked and to be validated, and she'll stop at almost nothing for it. Her best friend Debbie (Betty Gilpin), a former actress who happily left the profession to get married and start a family, urges Ruth to rethink her priorities and maybe even follow her own life path. Ruth is just barely able to decline her suggestion with politeness.Instead she goes home and has sex with Debbie's husband.\n\nRight as she appears to be at the end of her rope, Ruth gets a phone call from the casting director she earlier accosted in a bathroom (to ask for feedback on how to be more likeable and therefore land more acting jobs, naturally) telling her about an open casting call for \"unconventional women.\" Ruth shows up without any trepidation and learns that the casting is for a new show called GLOW \u2013 Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. The actresses are the wrestlers. The wrestlers are actresses. Ruth is desperate and continues on, despite the fact that one of the masterminds behind GLOW, Sam (Marc Maron) sees right through Ruth and is unimpressed. Or maybe he doesn't see through her, but he's still unimpressed. It's unclear, but what IS clear is that Ruth is approaching the whole thing with her trademark sense of desperation, and it isn't winning her any favors in Sam's eyes.\n\nRuth's efforts to be liked and stay liked throughout the episode are so embarrassing to watch that they're almost painful. When Sam cuts Ruth during rehearsals as punishment for trying to add flourish to her performance and improvise a ridiculous backstory that her character is in trouble for stealing a loaf of bread, you're almost glad that the characters in the show hated the whole thing as much as you did. And when she goes home to study professional wrestling and comes back the next day in full costume, reciting a monologue from \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" in the style of Hulk Hogan, you can appreciate what she's going for while also wanting her to stop, immediately. Fortunately her drive to be liked wins her a part on the show, but not because she impresses anyone with her performance or her stage presence.\n\nInstead, her show is cut short by her best friend Debbie, who has learned that Ruth slept with her husband Mark (Rich Sommer, one of Alison Brie's Mad Men co-stars). Debbie is furious and storms the gym to confront Ruth, who is downright resistant to the idea of any real confrontation. As Sam watches Debbie enter the ring and decide the only way she'll feel better is to kick Ruth's ass, he begins to daydream about the two of them as professional Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling \u2013 in full costume, surrounded by screaming fans. It seems like the chemistry between these two women is exactly what he's been looking for, and as Ruth looks at Sam while Debbie pins her to the ring, she can tell she's finally going to get that validation she was after, just not the way she wanted it.\n\nDebbie's entrance is a little bit of a dues ex machina moment, although I've always taken the stance that dues ex machina is a fine device, as long as the payoff is satisfying.

{"eta": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.\n\nI was one nightmare short of the climate apocalypse in mid-August. On the morning of August 6, I had to leave the coastal city of Palos Verdes, California. It was about two hours after 6 a.m., the time when the El Ni\u00f1o phase and anomalous weather had started up in the Pacific, a time when heat and humidity are two of the biggest contributors to global temperatures. But I'd barely crossed the border: The storm of August 6 was over the southern edge of the Pacific, right where California starts\u2014where, until the 1980s, it would be impossible for climate models to simulate it. And my trip was nearing its apex: my hope of attaining the climate apocalypse would be dead in its tracks for a full day. If I didn't make it off the coast by then, I'd be in the car.\n\nI was inside my Prius, driven with my kids in the back seat, when a friend texted me. He'd just gotten off the phone with an underground news organization, where he'd just heard the news that storms had broken the record high temperature of 100.3 degrees on August 5 in Santiago, Chile. The heat index at the University of Santiago, the facility that gives the station the unique name of El Ni\u00f1o, has held at 100 over the last two weeks, topping out at 129.\n\nThe official readout of those readings had a weather editor as a leading explanation: El Ni\u00f1o is associated with unusually warm sea temperatures in the central pacific, allowing more moisture to rise to the surface and cool down the atmosphere. If the temperature data were accurate, then Palos Verdes had broken the record, too. The data had indicated that the total number of rain clouds in the area should be about 8,000 in the morning of the 5th, and had more than tripled at 10 a.m. But it had ended up being just 6,200, not 8,000, and as the heat index (a measure of warming and cooling energy) was measured, it had even broken the old record at least twice that day.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" I thought as the news hit: \"Not even a month left for the fuckers who made the previous record to go back down? Would a cold snap take over before the pattern went into reverse? They've been keeping everyone up at night.\"\n\nI put my head back and looked at my kids. We had just become good pacific friends. All day, we'd listened to climate news from around the world, with stories like this as the filter: \"Heat record broken\u2014California breaks heat record.\" I spent much of my time feeling grateful for the warmth that has been historically important in our lives. It made me grateful that we'd never had to kill ourselves to become the richest, most powerful country in the world. So if I could only get away from this planet before getting turned into a firecracker, I didn't want to go.\n\nBut then my face fell, and I quickly backtracked, calling a climatologist on the phone about the few minutes before, wishing she would dial back the alarm. Of course, I found out that no one had called back then, nor was she expected to. She had simply seen the temperature reading on my phone on her desktop and told me to be careful, and that she'd told me to be on the lookout for another extreme weather event from the I.C.U.\n\n\"It doesn't even give the weather forecast for tomorrow,\" she explained.\n\n\"What can you tell us?\"\n\n\"I can't. What are you doing with your life?\"\n\n\"Some other reason!\"\n\n\"No, I just want to talk about the heat record.\"\n\nIn the traffic of Facebook status updates and tweets and text messages, I got nowhere. I felt hopeless. The storm had felt so intense, I didn't know if I needed to stay put or go off-track. Only half an hour later, I got a text from a friend who works at the main Palos Verdes airport: \"Have you heard the news about 100.3\" It was the news from Santiago. The extreme heat was not a new thing for the area\u2014there had been some recent milder weather, that's why I'd heard so much about it on climate-minded networks\u2014but I was expecting something different. He went on to share: \"The number has jumped.\"\n\nThe news was reported in most American media, but not yet in Spain. I found two major Spanish language news websites reporting on the break, but only one did a quick-release update: El Pais, or the Spanish edition of the New York Times. Within hours, it was over and we were talking about El Ni\u00f1o with (I think) about 20 people in the area, and it'd been", "topp": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.\n\nI was one nightmare short of the climate apocalypse in mid-August. On the morning of August 6, I had to leave the coastal city of Palos Verdes, California. It was about two hours after 6 a.m., the dust still blowing from a thunderstorm swirling in the distance, and I was about the only one working at the propane tank for a large refinery near the Loma Prieta earthquake zone, the epicenter of a quake and tsunami that destroyed much of western Mexico last September. It was also about two hours after I learned that I had been nominated to send the note from the President of the United States on a UNESCO world heritage site, in the midst of the building proposal for the ancient Maya capital. I was an intern at the EPA's Office of Indian Affairs, and I was here to take up my duties as an observer, when I suddenly found myself walking across a city built on the ruins of an ancient civilization \u2014 Tikal in Guatemala \u2014 for the first time.\n\nThose days, that could have been any day. In recent months, the rest of the Great Lakes Basin has been experiencing a serious bout of drought. And we have been alarmed by what's happened to massive fish populations in some remote places, and even to native populations on the shores of the Mississippi and Lake Erie. In early August, we wrote about these developments, responding with particular urgency to the headliner: the activation of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, or GLRI, a joint effort between the American and Canadian governments.\n\nBut I hadn't planned on being a GLRI observer. But as it turned out, my purpose had become more important than I imagined.\n\nShortly after the proposed treaty submission deadline (August 31), a large wharf-like structure, flagging in the darkness, appeared, and for whatever reason, I did not hear anything. But suddenly, I felt alone and sheathed in darkness. The aliens \u2014 if you can call them aliens \u2014 had found me. And they did not seem impressed.\n\nGallo told me in a phone conversation that at least 14 agreements were being negotiated between the parties, and they remained very much in flux. It would be next week before they finalized them; the Great Lakes Charter was about to be ratified; and proposals from the parties themselves to reverse pipeline design (part of the negotiations) or use new, innovative (for the Great Lakes) mining processes (part of the negotiations) were all ongoing.\n\nBut the treaty was already on the table, and I was there to witness it happen.\n\nBecause of my job at the EPA and personal involvement in environmental politics, I'd expressed an interest in challenging a recent protection plan on Lake Michigan since before the Declaration of the Rights of Man. But this kind of U.S. presidential letter is very much \"Nuclear Acknowledgment\": a gift from space that is meant to describe a new future that it is natural scientists like me, really alone in the game, cannot even fathom, much less describe in vivid detail. It's great to witness treaties like the one with GLRI, but much more satisfying is to feel either one, or both of those worlds with full force: the way the treaty was drafted, the legislative and protocol discussions, the truth and reality about the horrible consequences of climate change for our water supply.\n\nYou'll remember that, going into the UN meeting, I had earlier expressed a mild preference for the Kyoto Protocol. It was disappointing to see the Kyoto Protocol blotted out completely by President Obama's genuflections on climate change, and the forms the two nations' nations worked out had two paths but one goal: LEAP (a process for addressing hard emissions around the clock). But it didn't even come close to ending the moratorium on new coal-fired plants.\n\nNext to Climategate, climate change battles felt like something out of Walter Cronkite. In the years to come, he would be remembered in Berkeley as the guy who, for 18 months, waited on Hollywood stars and even threatened the life of the most famous Marine colonel after a British publication ran an article exposing some of his outlandish contacts with Bush administration officials. It was Cronkite's willingness to get dirty in return for accolades for a story that has become infamous, but the singular consequence that wrote itself was not his genuflection, but that of all the great stories of 9/11, we were living through high school memories of Cronkite and his milieu.\n\nThat was most likely one of the sources of my inexplicable anger at the GLRI proposal. That some of the most powerful, well-funded federal agencies were willing to negotiate a treaty about the restoration of the Great Lakes when so many scientists and activists are telling us it is imperative to tackle the real threats to our freshwater (seawater) system (wilding, the migration of toxic species", "human": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.\n\nI was one nightmare short of PTSD.\n\nIt didn't take much, that's what surprised me. No battles. No dead bodies. I spent just three and a half weeks as a contractor in Iraq, when the war there was at its height, rarely leaving the security of American military bases.\n\nFor several years now, Americans have become increasingly aware that a large number of veterans have gotten post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Iraq and Afghanistan. Studies estimate that at least 1 in 5 returning vets\u2014possibly as many as 1 in 3\u2014have it. Less notice has been given to the huge numbers of veterans who suffer some PTSD symptoms but not quite enough to be diagnosed as having the disorder. Civilian employees of the US government, contractors, and of course the inhabitants of the countries caught up in America's wars have gotten even less notice.\n\nThe thing is: It doesn't take much to develop the symptoms of PTSD. Our idea of what used to be called \"shell shock\" tends to be limited to terrible battles, not just the daily stress of living in a war zone or surviving a couple of close calls.\n\nThis is a story of how little it can take. I hardly saw a thing.\n\nI.\n\nMy first day in Iraq ended with an explosion.\n\nI had just made it \"in theater,\" as they said, with a plane-load's worth of contractors coming for this or that bit of danger pay. I was 32 years old, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, a nervous, excited, frightened policy wonk. I had executed my first will.\n\nPeople would ask me, Why go? For typical reasons: Adventure. Hazard pay. I was single. No kids, no lawn to mow. I thought it would be cool. I'd get to pal around with the troops and fly in helicopters and wear body armor. I'd get to learn more about the whole war thing, which had always obsessed me, as it does so many Americans. And if I were lucky, I might even catch a glimpse of how much more idiotic the Iraq War was than I already assumed. I had never bought into it, but that didn't mean I wasn't eager to be there.\n\nAnd then there was the work itself. My project fascinated me: to figure out what exactly was going on at a weird camp in Diyala Province where American troops were sort of detaining, sort of babysitting an Iranian cult group that was then on our list of foreign terrorist organizations. To a lawyer and policy wonk, a man whose boyhood had been consumed by all things military, the combo was irresistible.\n\n***\n\nThat first night, after we finished dinner at the DFAC, the Dining Facility, my supervisor and I drove our rental Ford Explorer through the concrete T-wall jungle of the curiously named Victory Base Complex, the giant American encampment at the edge of Baghdad International Airport. As we arrived at the shipping container that was to be my new temporary home: explosions. Then a piercing cry from loudspeakers in the distance: INCOMING! INCOMING! INCOMING!\n\nThe next day I'd learn that those explosions had blown up several people in front of the chow hall, right where we had exited just minutes earlier.\n\nIt was October 2007, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and General David Petraeus was the rising star of the moment with his \"surge\" strategy. Mortar and rocket attacks, which had once been repeated daily occurrences, were now plummeting. Gunfire, though, still prickitypricked the night, every night, out in the \"Red Zone,\" that wild yonder of the country beyond those T-walls. It sounded like disorganized fireworks, only without the happy spectacle.\n\nWhen the mortar and rocket attacks did come, it was usually early morning, between 5:45 and 6:00 a.m. I called it the Insurgent Alarm Clock. Afternoons featured \"controlled dets.\" A boom here or there as soldiers detonated duds, blew up UXO (unexploded ordnance).\n\nThe mortar and rocket attacks usually came early morning. I called it the Insurgent Alarm Clock.\n\nThe nights whirred with helicopters. Blackhawks patrolled the perimeter in pairs. Even on the ground they kept their rotors spinning for quick liftoffs, and there was a landing zone near my bed. But that didn't keep me from sleeping once I got some earplugs. Nor could the snores of the seven other men in the corrugated-metal containerized housing unit keep me awake.

If you are a player this can make your days better. We cannot go back.\n\n\nI have no complaints. This is the biggest and best change to the game from the potential to be any PvP monster to kill any other, ever!\n\n\nThe PvM players seem a lot more open to this. While not mandatory, even if you stay in. They're used to it for now.\n\n\nAlso I only advocate this if you like pvp pve fights and (my oppinion) enjoy them. If you are a healer like me, really enjoy this, most pve map is way too easy.\n\n\nI just hope people who hated on.\n\n\nfor example this is not recommended for a cheap alt that will be full tank. I didn't watch the other forums threads of people with 100c disposable bills that threw it on an alt that was WAY better than them. It isn't. This is a difficult choice, and a new experience.\n\nyou play to a set that suits you and that fits the character, nothing else, unless you have a lot of time to play a high reward character. I told you I'm not a bank man, so if you give up and not even try, you will be disappointed.\n\n\nDon't worry about why players dislike this game.

These will only work on your targets if that target has a **matching** hat that the spell was given to use. Using a spell which is'signed' to your hat is not a guaranteed tanking spell, even if your target is exactly like the crit plan, it does not negate the damage so it still has to be checked. The healer has no resistances and the target is without resistances, so this spell just let's them deal damage. The reason this works is because of the \"Use Only This Hat When This Spell Is Withheld\" option, this is where it is written into the mod. You are supposed to use this \"When A Skill Has Your Bretonic Keyword\" as the shield key, on all buffs. This may or may not mean you are supposed to use a kevlar item on the target, it all depends if your hat is *specifically* for this spell.\n\n\n* A full recharge spell should be cast whenever at least 1 target is, i.e. 1 chameleon, a hunter, and at least 1 tank. This can even be handy with your testing room or with the bosses for checking cooldowns. Though using all 3 sections of the RoT buffs it may not be (seemingly) possible without having your target's hat completely catered for.\n\n\n* Another thing to bear in mind is that while using TnM (TnM Slots & Limbs): If you use a 6sec spell with that same key then one is automatically added, so think about which one you would recommend to apply which buff and why. Also, if you are behind in FC on your DDP or running merc mine cycles (SS, CDR, Hit & Run damage reduction, etc) it is often best to bump off the large, purple timers due to the massive battery drain.\n\n\n* Instead of the walls behind the caster, I sometimes use the middle man lane to keep in mind if they are moving; if they are moving into my dodge path it can be a vital benefit to step in and attack them instead of it being just normal CMB.

It's not your job. You're a thief. There are plenty of other criminals out there who probably want something from you.\n\nJack the Ripper: That's right!\n\nBatman: And as someone who is willing to break the law, you should probably be able to tell.\n\nJack the Ripper: I never heard of that.\n\n[He grimaces]\n\nJack the Ripper: There must be a mistake. There's no way there can be four different hands \u2014 what if they're just holding it like a clock?\n\nBatman: Not that I and the Ripper would tell you, we're not trained in crime fighting. But I'm pretty sure you couldn't tell the difference between a clock and a sword by looking at them. [grinning] And besides, that clock didn't have a cover as well as, say, a suit of armor on it.\n\nJack the Ripper: Oh, come on Batman, you're joking.\n\nBatman: It's important here.\n\nJack the Ripper: Yeah\u2026 it is. But the problem is that all the X's and the O's in two hands means that both hands must be lopsided \u2014 like a V. The other X here is hand for the drawing of drawings. So because of these two X's and O's, the X-ray of the victim's hand is indeterminate. You don't have the teeth, it's just an X-ray image. So not only does this imply both hands are awash in blood, it's also just a poor way of assigning who the murderer is.\n\nBatman: What kind of detective do you think that is? [Two men] Ha! Yeah, I bet most detectives would point with their left hand. You, of course, would think with your right hand. Don't tell me you couldn't tell who the killer is either by reading the X-rays and acting like that's a wolf jumping at you at night. The name is Anakin Skywalker. This raises another important point: if the X's and O's here are random, they likely have no reference to any particular hand. Maybe they're trying to do a parody of Batman's outfit in which his left palm has an X with a Cat's Eye on top, but it's obvious that he'd be laughing his ass off if he saw himself with an X like that. In the two earlier TV versions of the panel, Jack is more abrasive, but Jack apparently throws the uncanny-valley-long-laptop out of his hand as he punches Joker in the face: Batman : In the U.S.A., there's always a doctor on call to get you ill if it's too late. Did your doctor do that? Jack the Ripper : I don't know!\n\nThe Fakeest Face You Have: A hand of a bystander points to the wrist of Jack, saying, \"Looks like to put all the pressure on to his right,\" which implies that the bullet will be on his stomach, but in this version Jack's hand is just hanging there. On the bright side, the hand is just in the way of getting too close to Joker, who's wearing his mask, if that's even possible. (For the record, Jack never points at the wrist of his attacker on this panel.) Orleans Striker, who's ripped right off the painting, points at it in her bloody hand. Because the wrist is clearly visible, it may be a downplayed example of these, or just a pretty nice visual cue:\n\nTo reduce the shock the spectator would feel seeing the victim's face, Joker wouldn't have to offer it up, and both Hands are seen together.\n\nHans Gruber: So who was that?

To clarify, in order to find the Minotaur you have to trigger its insanity (charred, injured or otherwise injured). In order to cast a root spell on the Minotaur you have to trigger his insanity again. As opposed to, say, forcing someone to complete a ritual to transform into the Minotaur or animating a giant boar in order to sacrifice it to them.

In a fight, he'll approach one of the women, take a literal look, and then take it out over her ankle before attacking the others. After that, he'll take things up a notch. The night of the Purification, he gets told by a woman to look for the Raven. He finds her, and, from what he's shown, she appears to be pregnant. Naturally, he wants her, so he calls for the caretaker who must immediately be called to assist her. All she does when the caretaker arrives is point him toward the remains of a side track. At the end of the book, he's revealed to be the Exorcist, and the women? There's no end to them.\n\nA very old oriental folklore story, \"Hou and the Queen\", has the hau (usually female) descend into a tombs to find a pregnant hau staring back at her from the doorway. When she reaches into her bag, the hau snatches the object and turns it into her daughter. But that's not the end of it. When the hau turns back from the queen, she finds that her daughter has been impregnated with another hau. So it turns out that the queen's intention was to use the hau to help her own daughter, but the hau stole it, so now she has to adopt the second daughter as her own.\n\nLive Action TV\n\nAnother classic example in Alphas...\n\nIn the Galaxy Quest episode \"Through the Looking Glass\", the sci-fi baddie Wizard Mong returns from a multiversal coup having just slain the Q in a single strike.

This only counts when somebody is specifically mentioned as being left-handed, not just because an actor is left-handed.\n\nHave some Trivia - The word \"sinister\" actually is derived from the Latin word for left-handedness, and also related to the Bar Sinister which is a symbol of bastardy, and thus untrustworthiness.\n\nThis is also related to Evil Twin; twins do often have opposite dominant hands, and an Evil Twin will (almost invariably) be the left-handed one.\n\nAdditionally, in older times, left-handedness was often a sign of evil or trickery because of the fact that people would shake hands with their right, grabbing each other by the wrists, in order to show that they were friendly and didn't have weapons. Of course, this is incredibly small-minded since if left-handed people were in the majority then it would be the other way around. Still, a lefty could shake with their right hand, grasping the other person's dominant hand, and attack with their weapon in their left hand while the other was defenceless - or even steal a rightie's weapon more easily. Also, during the Middle Ages, towers were built so defenders would have no problem swinging their swords down staircases while attackers would have more difficulties swinging up - and staircases are still built this way to this day. However, this only applied if both were right handed; if the attacker were left-handed, the two would be evenly matched.\n\nIn many cultures, before the invention of toilet paper and forks, the right hand was used for eating, greeting etc., while the left hand was used for wiping and other less savory things. In some places, being left-dominant was a sign that there was something inherently 'wrong' with the child, to the point of demonic possession, and to this day some parents will tie a left-handed child's hand behind their back until they learn to be ambidextrous. Ironically this will not change the hand that you instinctively lead with in your daily interactions.\n\nAnother related trope is for a character to lose his right hand, symbolizing his loss of a moral compass. This can presage a Face\u2013Heel Turn by the Hero. It is also common for Mad Scientists to have a mechanical right arm. Alternatively, the left hand might become the repository of Sealed Evil in a Can. Compare Red Right Hand.\n\nA subtrope is The Killer Was Left-Handed, where there is actually evidence that the killer was left-handed. Examples of that trope should go there.\n\nThe opposite, when left-handedness is viewed favorably, is The Southpaw. Sometimes overlaps with Left-Handed Mirror. Also see I Am Not Left-Handed.\n\nExamples:\n\nopen/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nGreen Lantern: Eventual villain Sinestro wears his power ring on his left hand.\n\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\n\nGamebooks\n\nInverted (thematically at least) in the Lone Wolf gamebooks: magic traditions inspired by the Forces of Light are referred to as \"left-handed\", while the Black Magic of the servants of God of Darkness Naar are referred to as \"right-handed\".\n\nLiterature\n\nIn The Bible, Ehud, one of the judges, actually managed to assassinate a king by hiding a miniature weapon on his right hip.

{"eta": "US Birth Rate Hits New Low \u2013 A Nation of Singles\n\nJohn Mauldin\n\nDecember 21, 2012\n\nToday's OTB is not directly about the increasing incidence of unplanned births nor is it about the changes in population size. It is not an \"age of marriage\" issue. It is not an abortion-rights issue. It is not even about the growing undercount of children, whether within a single-parent home or by adoption.\n\n\nThe only interest that the OTB presents today is the continuing downward trend in the country's birth rate.\n\nI recently listened to a lecture given by Dr. John Mauldin whose new book, entitled, Why the Birth Rate Is Falling, has become the title of an RT\u00c9 TV series. Mr. Mauldin, who is President of the Midwives Federation Ireland, acknowledges the accuracy and popularity of the statistic that, according to the most recent National Survey of Parents and Babies, 34%, of all Irish couples aged 1 to 4 years were married as of 2005. He further acknowledges that, as the birth rate has declined, so has the proportion of young people to parents: Now, 87% of women aged 15-39 live with their parents, while in the UK, most women stay at home with their children. There are obviously more people, in Ireland and beyond, in that cohort of the main target of the declining birth rate. And yet, despite the fact that the proportion of young people to parents has declined, the number of children born has certainly not.\n\nWhile I am hardly an expert in the numbers involved, I can at least draw from the numbers and case histories (measured in the millions) before me some conclusions. These are based on careful analysis of surveys conducted by respected research bodies such as Pregnancy Advisory Groups (PAGs), educational organisations (such as Youthvice), organisations that study child maltreatment (such as IHMS), and organisations dealing with the situation of single mothers, both single parents and divorced mothers, and children within the major social groups. Indeed, it was only under the supervision of IHMS in the years 1960 and 1979 that reliable and impartial data began to be collated. Based on this work and the range of the sources used in its publishing, Mr. Mauldin produces a series of numbers that cannot be denied.\n\nI will quote those figures presented in the lecture. Since we live in a postmodern world, whether or not one agrees with every word of them and everyone's interpretations of them, one might ask, are we really bothering to add up the statistics, to find out what exactly they are saying, and what they actually are making of them?\n\nThe figure that we are all looking for is that of inefficiency. If we need to increase the number of live births we can achieve if the total numbers of births continues to plummet at a more constant rate than has been the case for the past 50 years or so. The figures that Mr. Mauldin presents show that the average rate of decrease is one of 10 births per year. That is a very large number indeed. And, as the \"age of marriage\" is going, so too is the \"age of death.\"\n\nThe ongoing effect of early marriage or marriage earlier in life on a young person's lifestyle may well be what is triggering the current rate of decline \u2013 i.e., marriage at a young age. That the rate of decline can occur at a rate 10 times greater than the rate of increase in the total number of births is no real surprise. Of course, it is plausible that the drop in the number of births could be partly being driven by a drop in the marital age, but that would be a difficult scenario.\n\nIf we look at the figures in a more painstaking way, we are able to tease apart what is really going on and, thus, gain some insight into what happened in the early part of the 21st century. The trouble begins with the ratio of the age at which first marriage is going (at 65%) and when couples first have children (at 23%). Using the demographic reports issued by every major organisation, and extrapolating to their current age groups and marriages (all done with the aid of detailed accounting and statistical analysis), it is possible to establish that, nationally, roughly 2,000 children was born every week in 2005 after the full implementation of the National Minimum Wage (NTW) (see appendix A). However, this is in striking contrast with the period between 1982 and 1996, when approximately three times that number of children was born annually (that's approximately 4,000) (see appendix B). To see any obvious explanation for the fact that the numbers were rising then, or why there has been a sharp increase in the number of births today since 2004, you have to look at the ages of the people who are now reproducing.\n\nAccording to the latest data available from the Social Protection Department, approximately 40% of Ireland's population is under the age of 16. Given", "topp": "US Birth Rate Hits New Low \u2013 A Nation of Singles\n\nJohn Mauldin\n\nDecember 21, 2012\n\nToday's OTB is not directly about the increasing incidence of unplanned births\u2014it's about the continuing decline in the birth rate. After an astonishing increase that peaked at almost 30% just after World War II, the national birth rate has fallen at almost twice the rate of inflation, hitting a level not seen since the Depression. It dropped just enough to level the playing field for the next generation, allowing all couples the opportunity to make more use of their family resources while improving family life for all.\n\nWhat this means is that there are more overall unmarried single people in the United States today than ever before. More and more of them are age 30 and younger. That is a scary prospect for the economy. If couples desire to start families, and indeed, many do, then it appears that an unprecedented shift toward using a sperm bank may be in our future, due in large part to the decline in the birth rate. This is good news for all women who would have otherwise missed out on having a child. But we can only hope that, thanks to the many birth programs that have been effective in the past, U.S. fertility rates will soon return to prerecession levels. [more]\n\nThe birth rate is dropping again. But the main driver is the declining number of childbearing couples. All anyone wants to know about this is where everyone stands. Here's our latest graphic, which shows birth rates for all groups from 1989 to 2009, with 2009 values weighted more heavily (1) for age and gender, and (2) because of big swings among the demographic groups when birth rate makes a big difference.\n\nToday's Bureau of the Census report is somewhat unusual, as it gives us the oldest participants (all are still under the age of 45) and the youngest ones.

Dvorkin\n\nDecember 18, 2012\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention's legal arm says its \"fundamental faith\" forbids its ministers from participating in church-sponsored groups that hold white supremacist views such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations and does not allow its clergy to attend segregated or \"separate but equal\" schools.\n\nThe ultra-conservative seminary Moravian Theological Seminary on Saturday retracted its statement after a Tennessee judge ordered it to explain why it was part of the denomination's list of prohibited religious entities.\n\nAn attorney for the Presbyterian Church (USA) condemned the seminary's departure from orthodoxy.\n\n\"In a shallow and deplorable attempt to appear more Christian than it is, the SBC has suspended seminary faculty and removed its iconic logo,\" said attorney Barbara LaFave, who represented Clergy for Christ after the denomination banned it for embracing a 9/11-rejecting plan for globalism.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Tennessee Civil Rights Commission accuses the SBC of discrimination based on \"race, religion, age and sex,\" saying the governing body violated the state's civil rights law by creating a religion \"free from all Supreme Court decisions that have condemned the creation of a nation or religion based on race, religion or sex.\"\n\nDallin H. Oaks and Kevin J. Hartnett\u2014the bishops who together chair the SBC's 55-member Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission\u2014remained adamant that their leaders had issued a \"shameful and disingenuous\" public document, describing the statement as \"blatant, unremitting in its discrimination.\"\n\nThat assertion does not square with what company ethics expert Frank Blachford called it, \"an elementary story of thinking through a problem and coming to an accurate conclusion, and a service the Baptist church needs.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, when Hayes Way Baptist Church and its surrounding New Nashville neighborhood were in the midst of a violent surge in crime, membership plummeted to about half its current roughly 90,000 (from 2,000 in 1977). Methodist president Dr. Jerry Marshall described he brutal 1994 killings as a matter of \"grief and justice,\" while Nashville's Bishop James Gwin praised the neighbors who stood alongside the victims and neighbors who \"stood by their neighbors.\"\n\nThat actually may be the real message.

I have a somewhat different take on the shift than our author, my very-long-time friend Gary D. Halbert (founder of ProFutures and former business partner from the '90s); and I will be writing about this next year. There is a significant transformation going on in my thinking about how the political world in the US (and, I suspect, much of Europe as well) impacts the economy.\n\nThe real eye-opener here is Gary's reporting of the role of singles, rather than what is happening with the birth rate and fertility rate, although those are important too. As a surging percentage of US voters, singles are a game changer. They see the world differently in terms of their own personal security and the future \u2013 or at least that is how they vote.\n\nTo get a sense of how powerful the marriage effect is, not just for women but for men, too, look at the exit polls by marital status. Among non-married voters \u2013 people who are single and have never married, are living with a partner, or are divorced \u2013 Obama beat Romney 62-35. Among married voters Romney won the vote handily, 56-42.\n\nOK, we all kind of knew that singles as a group favored Obama. But by that much? Singles are a new and rapidly rising part of the population that has not been well accounted for demographically, and that is the real import of what Gary shows us. I can tell you how many women will be eligible to vote in 2030, for instance, but there is nothing in the birth rate to predict the number of singles we'll have. That is shifting, and in terms of voting patterns that shift (at least so far) is large.\n\nThis piece gives us quite a bit to think about as we contemplate how our entitlement programs and taxes will eventually settle out. The trends Gary describes are part and parcel of our national dysfunctionality. We want maximal healthcare and minimal taxes \u2013 at least on 98% of us. Healthcare benefits have to be paid for by someone; and that trade-off is going to be large in terms not just of taxes but also how capital formation, productivity, and employment are affected. It is hard to overstate the implications of how healthcare demographics will affect the economy.\n\nAs I write this note, the hustle and bustle of Christmas shopping and planning are going on all around me. My family will celebrate Christmas together on the 26th, so I can have all my seven kids and their families in one place under my roof.\n\nI wish you and your family a very Merry Christmas and a great New Year.

Halbert\n\nDecember 18, 2012\n\nUS Birth Rate Hits New Low \u2013 A Nation of Singles\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\n1. US Birth Rate Falls to Record Low in 2011\n\n2. Birth Rate Needed to Maintain Current Population\n\n3. A Nation of Singles \u2013 Implications For the Future\n\n4. How Did We Become a Nation of Singles?\n\n5. Conclusions \u2013 How Do We Turn the Trend Around?\n\nOverview\n\nOne of the issues I have been focused on for the last several years has been the trend in demographics in the US and in developed countries in general. Our populations are getting older \u2013 we all know that. But the reasons why our populations are getting older are not widely understood by many Americans. Those reasons include the falling birth rate, the falling fertility rate, the falling marriage rate and the explosion in singles \u2013 people who never marry.\n\nThe US birth rate fell to a record low in 2011. The marriage rate is tumbling as well. And the number of single Americans is now at a record high. The implications of these developments are troubling, not only for the economy, but also for the investment markets and the continual expansion of the federal government. Government debt has spiraled out of control in recent years, and the demographics suggest that this trend will continue as we care for an aging population.\n\nToday, we will look at some new information on demographic trends in the US and in the West in general that should concern you \u2013 and all Americans for that matter. This will be a continuing theme in my E-Letters in the months and", "eta_suffix": " fact that the numbers were rising then, or why there has been a sharp increase in the number of births today since 2004, you have to look at the ages of the people who are now reproducing.\n\nAccording to the latest data available from the Social Protection Department, approximately 40% of Ireland's population is under the age of 16.

{"eta": "It is not a matter of being optimistic or pessimistic, knowing or not knowing elementary things, of being responsible or not for events. Those who would like to be thought of as wise people do not wish to be mistaken for others.\n\nAfter all, the clever are not men in small clothes walking alone about. They are not people who sit around and wait quietly, but members of assemblies, forming voluntary associations. And so what reason is there for thinking the populace, which already has this capacity, would suddenly get rid of it simply because they didn't believe it in the first place? Moreover, these assemblies won't be permanent: there will, of course, be disputes between them; and those disputes will be natural, inevitable consequences of the same principles and laws that define voluntary associations and increase their strength. Those laws are only the result of our own wish for cooperation, which is very sincere and helpful. It's not our wish to violate our own ideals and suppress happiness. The political ideal is only meant to assert an aim to establish and defend equality with other citizens, and people are always better off if they treat themselves to the material necessities that keep our society going and give us the possibility of resisting wickedness, of organizing an association and getting together to discuss the problems which really concern us. Even that ambition only comes to an end if people begin to accept equality and take pride in having it as an important goal. Then we don't need a political ideal: we are free men, acting on our own initiative and freely chosen. We can distribute the wealth freely which will further the happiness of the people because people will know that they're doing so thanks to the absence of harm that is being done to others. If we think about it and practice it, we'll see how much the people really deserve in comparison to this ideal. Only when people allow for social equality as they freely consent to will we have truly true equality, truly glorious equality.\n\nSo you have to be too naive as to see the reasons why people won't want to believe this. For a great number of people it's all about the idea of being a worthy member of the nation, as if to explain away the social inequalities that have already taken place during the whole history and the numerous social indignities which they suffered. When people ask themselves that question, they think: 'Well, wouldn't it be better to live like us and not believe in the ideal at all? I mean, there are many people who went to war in order to protect people that were being oppressed, they were unjustly massacred and so on, so the ideal is much more important than the necessity of such attacks, even though it is required by the ideal. It's easier to say: 'Wait till it's better for me to do a job and thus show what I can do. Then I can consider the ideal no more important than that: that the individual need not suffer unjustly and the whole nation have a chance of living together in peace.' But it's all nonsense. And if you believe in it you'll understand the higher truth behind our nation's strong and voluntary activity.\n\nWhat you don't see in this ideal is the fact that not only people, who have no idea of the higher equality of the world with the individual, but even those who would wish to abolish it, would refuse the existence of it in their consciousness even if it were just at that moment to become human. If these people can see the truth behind the community and what it can be made up of and decide that it's a good ideal for the new society, they will be in the same position as the people who have to live with inequality in the future for reasons of history. They will have the feeling of helplessness and disappointment and, while they have no right to choose against it in their minds, they will understand that they have the worst possible chance of living peaceably under a society where this equality existed. It would be the same thing as the bourgeois theory of the welfare of the proletariat which was handed down to us by bourgeois society. If in this situation those people can even think that it is desirable to live freely so we may be together in peace, why should not they in time have equal power to decide to this and exclude it from their minds? I mean, it should not be necessary to destroy their thoughts. I mean, this is another of the common conclusions of the capitalist countries where our economy is based. No, they simply don't understand that even if there were no longer a need to lift anything under the ownership of the state, their desires, their interests, would prevent them from recognizing the so-called essence of the community and thus establishing a more just society.\n\nFinally, are you getting any ideas here? After all, it's useless to think that you can win an election by making everyone agree with you on everything. By such an approach, you make it seem as if you'd accept the possibility of everything, which is absurd. If somebody finally gets elected to parliament, he or she won", "topp": "It is not a matter of being optimistic or pessimistic, knowing or not knowing elementary things, of being responsible or not for events. Those who would like to be thought of as wise people do not wish to be mistaken for others.\n\nAfter all, the clever are not men in small clothes walking alone about. They are not people who sit around and wait quietly, but members of established companies or societies, leaders and followers. And never do they do the same things everyone else does; they do something different. They practise a different art than others. Many, in fact, have entered into a strange state of mind and actually become great in many different ways. They are found taking up completely different occupations, often the same occupation in different countries, and after a while change their occupation and become unknown. And usually if someone knows them or is acquainted with them at all, they know very little about themselves. It is not easy to begin some new career in such a manner. The question is, which question could one really ask about oneself and how one would commence? Even then people are always so far from being able to prove it that the years go by without attempting to do so.\n\nHowever, by this train of reasoning, we can find very quickly that leaders and superior people do something very unusual indeed. They practise in more or less the same manner as everybody else, but they do it more directly. Their aim is to achieve the same goals as everybody else. Because their goals are not the same. Their aim is not so much the success in life of their individual underlings, but they believe that a success in life of their entire company is to be chosen and that success in the art of business is to be chosen and practised by many. In the art of business the best must be chosen, and in the art of life, the weakest must be eaten and the strong will not have to live. Then we can find, finally, the great separation, the immense gulf, that separates the extremes.\n\nSo, the genius of Gandhi too was great; just as of many great saints in history. And what did they achieve? What their leaders did to fulfil their dreams and strived for their ideals? The details of it are the details of history. There is absolutely no safe conjecture of it. It happens simply and quickly that a genius will be overlooked and his name not honoured. I would, I am certain, also have this index to cite in any case where a complex subject presents itself. In the same way the greatness of great saints could also be noted. It is quite an individual case. In other respects, the significant is such as passes from man to man. It is both individual and collective; it is very, very rare that such a situation, are ever seen.\n\nFrom what I have said thus far I infer that the great personalities of some times and places are the leaders and the group intellectuals amongst mankind. So there is a great period of time in which certain spiritualities and minds alone exercised such intense influence and then disappeared. This is the same case with masters and other strong men and philosophies. This is the opposite from what happens in an ideal condition when these oneness-bound forces are harnessed towards the common good and the common purpose. At this moment instead of transferring the enormous energies of these oneness-bound forces into a super-active realm where they can act and do it boldly to universal enlightenment, they allocate them, instead, into a special sanctity in which they must either passively or actively work in those areas of the ideal world system where they enjoy the highest quantity of influence. Here we have a change of direction, with one spirit holding the other inside her like a harpoon.\n\nEvery mode of human action is, while modest, very versatile. Such a time also is without boundaries. Thus, I have asked how this spiritual change happens, and how will it take place. The answer is this, the the possession of such energies by a certain degree of a certain type of person and the assistance from other great individuals who play in this situation--this is the conversion of a man. He becomes a new man. Thus, in my opinion, greatness is the process in which this secret to the greatness of the time is developed and personified.\n\nThere is, however, no great poet in the world now or for a very long time, who has had the power to cause an entire generation of people to fear rather than look upon each other as dear or dear friends. It is even harder now than it was thirty or forty years ago, to be a world leader and a world personality on this solid axis of world harmony and brotherhood. But there is of course the possibility. A man of genius can do it. Perhaps it is not necessary for a contemporary figure to win the acclaim of the entire world at this critical moment. He is certainly not required. What is required is knowledge of certain central points, certain general principles which will be able to pull the whole of humanity away from its group prejudice.", "human": "It is not a matter of being optimistic or pessimistic, knowing or not knowing elementary things, of being responsible or not for events. Those who would like to be thought of as politicians should be thrown onto the trash heap of history when, as the norm goes, they have no idea about everything or almost everything related to it in that activity.\n\nOf course I am not speaking about those who throughout the various millennia turned public affairs into instruments of power and wealth for the privileged classes, an activity where the real records of cruelty have been imposed during the last eight or ten thousand years about those we have certain traces of the social behaviour of our species, whose existence as thinking beings, according to scientists, barely covers 180,000 years.\n\nIt is not my purpose to get involved in such topics that would surely bore almost one hundred percent of the people continuously being bombarded with news across the media, going from the written word to three-dimensional images that are starting to be shown in expensive cinemas. The day is not far away when they shall also predominate in the already fabulous television images per se. It is no accident that the so-called leisure industry has its headquarters in the heart of the empire that tyrannizes everybody.\n\nWhat I would like to do is to rest on the current starting point of our species to speak of the march towards the abyss. I might even speak of an \"inexorable\" march and I would certainly be closer to reality. The idea of a Last Judgement is implicit in the most practiced religious doctrines among the inhabitants of this planet, without anyone classifying them for that as being pessimistic. On the contrary, I think it is a basic duty of all serious and sane persons, who number in the millions, to fight to postpone and perhaps to prevent that dramatic and imminent event in today's world.\n\nNumerous dangers threaten us, but two of them, nuclear war and climate change, are decisive and both are ever farther away from coming close to a solution.\n\nVerbose demagoguery, the statements and speeches of the tyranny imposed upon the world by the United States and its powerful and unconditional allies, on both topics, do not admit the slightest doubt in that respect.\n\nJanuary 1st of 2012, the western and Christian New Year, coincides with the anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution in Cuba and the year celebrating the 50th anniversary of the October Crisis of 1962 that put the world on the brink of a nuclear world war and this forces me to write these lines.\n\nMy words would be lacking in meaning if they had the objective of blaming on the American people, or on any other country which is an ally of the United States in the unusual adventure; they, like all the other peoples of the world, would be the inevitable victims of the tragedy. Recent events happening in Europe and elsewhere show massive indignation by those who are led to protest by the unemployment, shortages, reductions in their incomes, debts, discrimination, lies and politicking and lead to brutal repressions by the guardians of established law and order.\n\nWith growing frequency one speaks of military technologies that affect the entire planet, the only satellite known to be inhabitable hundreds of light years away from any other that may perhaps be suitable if we were to move at the speed of light, three hundred thousand kilometres per second.\n\nWe should not ignore that if our marvellous thinking species should disappear, many millions of years would go by before another one capable of thinking would arise, by virtue of the natural principles that rule as a consequence of the evolution of the species, discovered by Darwin in 1859 and which today is acknowledged by all serious scientists, whether they are religious or not.\n\nNo other era in the history of mankind has known the dangers that today humanity faces. Persons like me, at 85 years old, had reached our 18th birthdays with high school graduation degrees before the first atomic bomb had been put together.\n\nToday artefacts of this type, ready to be used \u2013 incomparably more powerful than those that produced the heat of the sun over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u2500 add up to thousands.\n\nWeapons of this kind that are kept in storage, added to those already deployed by virtue of agreements, reach figures that surpass twenty thousand nuclear missiles.\n\nThe use of just one hundred or so of those weapons would be enough to create nuclear winter that would cause a horrible death in a short time for all the human beings living on the planet, as the American scientist and Rutgers University professor Alan Robock has brilliantly explained along with computerized data.\n\nThose used to reading news and serious international analyses know how the risks of the outbreak of war with the use of nuclear weapons increase as the tension grows in the Middle East, where in the hands of the Israeli government hundreds of combat-ready nuclear weapons are accumulated, and whose nature as a strong nuclear power is neither admitted or denied.

The optimized implementations of algorithms in R are based on the work of Hebb, Whoa, and Ray. Our source code for implementation is available from http://www.research.att.com/i/ar38468.html. ar38468 provides a bit-length encoding (aka, base-10) in R which treats digits from 1 to 10000 as integer space variables. R math_deriv has to perform a test on arrays of this length to show that any function with count >= 1 can be rounded to count decimal number. It used various steps to fix this: 1) Modified the code to pass along a count of length 0 before evaluating any function. 2) Modified the call to math_deriv to be >= 1, meaning 0 <= count > 1000. 3) Modified the subroutine math_get_args to make it accept arguments up to 1. This allows manipulating the array as one data frame. 4) Included the bounds code for the array to avoid confusion with std::memory_order_consume() or perl's array_store(). 5) Based upon math_get_params (see [Math::RNG] ) to avoid C/C++ aliasing bugs. 6) Modified the usage of the R_GETFUNCTION ( rfuncall) convenience function to get the function name instead of looking for it in R::Lambda and R::SLambda. 7) The mem n operations described in [RNGs], as well as the R_PRED_MEMORY from the [multimap] module, have been modified to introduce modern additional function names. (It's possible that our implementation of rb_rand incorrectly uses a synonym, to be safe, so please report if you find this to be the case!) Implementations of the functions are a bit slower, but this is due to a pure float/long module implementation and is correct for all implementations of these functions (though moving routines to more general R-space variables may incur significant speedup). Please report any bugs or changes to this text, or to the compilers at http://www.research.att.com/i/ar38468.html. My note: A minor issue which I found myself in after implementing these functions is that the function names are sometimes \"corrupted\". It may occur when some of these names are allowed on the number table but not on the argument list. I've pulled the names back into the correctly permissible subset.

{"eta": "Author's Notes: Comments and criticisms are welcome and appreciated. I will try to update this story with new chapters as regularly as possible. The ending has already been planned.\n\nThis story is extremely dark. The characters have all different personalities and we see their reactions to the events that happen around them. Their thoughts and emotions are shown to the reader to be very painful to watch. The beginning of the story isn't very explicit but I will try to pay attention to everything the characters do every day because it is implied that one day they will stop being children and end up in jail.\n\nPlease be aware that the author will intentionally change some things and write sentences that you can only imagine how it will look like if the real author wrote them. Please make up your own mind and decide how exactly you feel about it, even if you hate it.\n\nChapter 1:\n\nRoman has to admit, seeing the monster bleed out like that was one of the most thrilling things he had ever seen. If that monster hadn't died of old age then he would have decided to retaliate against it during his homecoming.\n\nThe funny thing is, most monsters don't really care about them being inside their forest and this monster was no exception. Even more ironically, it didn't care if they died due to the monster being inside the forest and being terrorized by human beings.\n\nHe would have let them live, and worked his ass off to get to them.\n\n\"Maybe it doesn't care because it knows if this human is a good guy or bad\" was all the monster said in a very bored and unconcerned tone. It sounded like it was trying to make a comment to another monster, another being.\n\nRoman and Ruby had just arrived in a small river valley, surrounded by empty forests and lush fields. They had come to this river for a sightseeing trip and maybe try a cave to escape the snowstorm that was surrounding them. The weather conditions seemed suitable enough for them. All they wanted was to sit down in a nice place and enjoy each others company and enjoy their day.\n\nThey had walked around the valley for a little while with a slight snowing on the ground and were out of breath from their activity. Their destination was a big oak tree with a low hanging tree branch that most easily held them up because they were on wet feet.\n\nOf course, the monster didn't act like a monster normally would as the alien around him had definitely talked to him about being prepared and said that he wanted to prepare for what happened in the present when they encountered some rather dangerous monsters. He did get a scare from Roman's stomach when Roman thought that the monster had been swallowed by that alien and when they tried to convince the monster that he wasn't crazy.\n\nThe monster scoffed at that but eventually he might just try to eat that human, or he may go down with his mouth as opposed to his stomach.\n\n\"Well, then let's get ready\u2026\"\n\nHis expression must have changed once the creature seemed to notice that his face was slightly pale and tired.\n\n\"Wanna see some smoke.\"\n\nThe creature suddenly got excited and had the monster jump off of him and start running, which shocked and surprised both of them.\n\nThey started running towards the forest so that they would be able to communicate with their cave as they was unfamiliar to the forest. Ruby began to shiver but Roman was dead silent and didn't seem to notice what was wrong. When they reached the forest they both found a clearing at the end of a small field. The trees were half way up the hill and they could see the forest clear to the north beyond all these trees.\n\nAs their eyes landed on the clearing the monster let out a long annoyed howl that sounded like it could have only been heard in the distance by a loud bell that they could hear from across the forest.\n\nThe light of a moon started to come through the trees and they could see a wide, flat expanse of the ground with trees as far as the eye could see.\n\nThe two heroes fell silent as they were almost speechless by the vastness of the forest. They could really only see the darkness if they were far enough away and could only make out the lines on the trees from far distance. And that meant that there were several areas of the large forest that they couldn't make out through the darkness due to the huge trees of the forest trying their best to block them from vision.\n\nA moment had passed and then Roman noticed the monster leaping across the opening, with both feet dangling off the ground. The monster had obviously already known about this because he turned his back and started running while ignoring those of them trying to communicate with him with arm stretches and not a single eye open.\n\nThe monster ran just a few meters before stepping into the opening. The two heroes realized that there was a dead end ahead and ran in order to avoid it.\n\n\"What the fuck-\"", "topp": "Author's Notes: Comments and criticisms are welcome and appreciated.

Originally I was planning to go a bit further, to spend the weekend with a friend of mine in Phoenix, but I ended up staying with a friend in Tucson. Since then, I've created a blog while I work on my next story. There are three chapters coming up in this story, but since I'm not releasing chapters on WRS, I've decided to release the first chapter as a self-published tale. To my disappointment, the dates are too far off for WRS, so I'll continue with the self-published tale instead.\n\nWhat happens if the Elector doesn't win?

Is that true?\"\n\n\"No. I mean, we used to house exchange students. There have been several, in fact. But right now? No. We haven't had an exchange student live with us for about four years.\"\n\n\"He described the exchange student as a girl about his age. Blonde. Very energetic personality. Unique style of dress. Does that sound like any of your previous wards?\"\n\n\"No. The only other blonde girl was about six years ago. But other than her hair color, not how you describe. She was very conservative, really.\"\n\n\"Did they have a relationship?\"\n\n\"A romantic relationship? They were only twelve.\"\n\n\"Still, did you see anything that would make you think that? Any signs of attraction? Unrequited feelings? Returned affections? Sometimes these things can bring up repressed feelings.\"\n\n\"I suppose that there may have been some feelings. A crush. But it never went beyond that.\"\n\n\"The reason I'm asking is because your son claims that he and the exchange student who was supposedly living with you the last few years were in a romantic relationship. Did he have any such feelings for someone more recently?\"\n\n\"No. He used to have a crush on a girl at school, but that was a while ago.\"\n\n\"How long ago?\"\n\n\"I guess over... three years?\"\n\n\"Nothing since then?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. He just seemed like he lost interest in chasing girls.\"\n\n\"Did she fit the description? Blonde, energetic, unique?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. Was Jackie a blonde, dear?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure either. She had streaks of colors in her hair, though.\"\n\n\"Hmm. He claims the fictional girl and he have been in a relationship for the last two years. I'm just trying to find out if they are related.\"\n\n\"I don't think he's ever had a girlfriend. He even went to his senior prom alone.\"\n\n\"Is your son socially awkward?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. He has friends. Do you think this has something to do with someone from school?\"\n\n\"We don't know... These next questions are hard to ask, but we think they're important.

But do they have a secret kurtr. We hear from KK and his young compatriots The story is based on two years of adventures that two young men, K.K. and R. R, had during the summer season of 1999. After a \"broom fight\" where they were exchanging jabs online, K.K. found his hostel had a black witch in it. It was to be too early. Having a change of scenery was a trial from KK, who liked to get away from this fact, as well as the fact that his hostel had been previously used to house security officers of the A.B.T. Police Division. A chilly night had come, and K.K. and R were soaking in the warm water bath when a group of around nine men, including one wearing his \"cursed\" jinni, strode in, and quietly forced the K.K. to sit outside while the others casually turned up the heat up to 32 degrees. With that, the kurtr descended in a cloud of smoke accompanied by the sound of giggling and mumbling. K.K., having been earlier approached by a real kurtr, and at a slight persuasion now being forced to sit outside instead of inside in what he had initially known as \"his\" black witch, felt a very pleasant tinge of satisfaction while being forced to \"sit for the kurtr.\" Among those observing, two younger college aged men, M. R. and M.D. were just as surprised as K.K. We will spare you the details of our conversation with them, as they have called it a \"fight\". Later, K.K. and his family were once again getting wind as the smoke eased from its coma. Once again, in this setting, he had to sit outside and continue to vent his heat. All that being the case, one of the police officials politely said that their posting here would not be a problem, as they could go back to their places of residence later. They have left now, having been back in their respective homes on different occasions with no further problems since then - other than a huge battle over who was to be the next to be assaulted to a room for being 'fantasists.' THE END IN LONDON, D.C. MY \"Ladies and Gentlemen, my dear friend,\" Daphni Saliguri wrote to \"Mariha, Daughter of Attila\" through a friend in Mumbai after the recent \"victory\" in the drama comedy duo, \"What's Happening Now.\" Her note went on to say that her friend had said she'd never heard \"A.B.T.'s\" \"clumsy play\" had as much of \"glamour\" as it had this evening. In the play is one of those \"OMG!!!\" moments where you throw in your arms and say \"Ah-ha!\" The delay was, she said, a woman's word against a man's word that ended up getting him in no better shape than \"A.B.T.\" when he questioned them on the question regarding why no phone calls had gone through to the woman who had sent for two of their mothers. Saliguri had a friend of hers, a chartered accountant for a big real estate firm, who is part of the team to pilot the particular project. Saliguri and her friend had come to a conference in London to discuss a lease on a small estate he was taking on. A few days later, they all got on an Oasis flight and travelled to India for a month. The latter's note was short - from her \"A.B.T.\" I have a friend who lives in London, and she has heard it has been so bad. She has asked for a picture, but I won't say where to get it. Today there is no issue with any calls going through to her, she says. Saliguri, however, is not happy with the state of her \"Oasis\" - her friend's flat is filthy and he doesn't have a TV. Saliguri doesn't really understand the \"why\" of it, as she says he is \"a regular guy.\" As a whole, Saliguri is demanding more action on all fronts and herself. Aged now, Saliguri, who travels more than she used to, is also expecting her marriage to prove more fruitful. Saliguri is both, but soon her fears of her \"Oasis\" coming to end will be realised.", "topp": "Print Email to Friend | From Tehelka Magazine, Vol 8, Issue 12, Dated 26 Mar 2011 CURRENT AFFAIRS COVER STORY K Klutch Klan Friendship Meeting Where Khutta is concerned, the Khurts of Kerala, a popularly referred to as Kerala Khurts, are extremely popular, thought to be the largest group of people in Kerala, and even are known for breeding lots of Christians. Many have also decided to give the kurts their own place within the Kulkarni Sansthan on the outskirts of Kochi, and that is no small thing to do. The function was attended by over 250 people, and involved spreading Buddhism, meeting a \"buddhist\" babu and exchanging much needed online messages.The meeting started off with attendance by a group that is predominantly well educated, and to a certain extent it was a matter of pride on their part to be an atheist in their Christian home. With this fact, many questions were raised as to why a dharma friend of theirs would suddenly become converts to Buddhism. Several individuals and groups both from the Christian and Muslim worlds had come to Kochi earlier and made similar converts who had also converted to Buddhism. As a result, most of the people at the meeting felt the need to come to Kochi to find more answers, and many felt that this started the period of news media campaigns on the subject. However, even as some individuals showed a taste for the transition, others were deeply undressed for being part of the revivalist movement, and faced guilt in saying they had not felt the same earlier but felt a real convert once they met and interacted with the Khurt.There was a fair amount of thought given to the topic of Kaur. For her, her mother comes from the third generation of the Khurt, and when he was young he used to listen to the kurtt to advise the girl, who was at the time 15, on her career in India. The mother felt it was almost blasphemous that she would lay down such an idea, especially for a small child, and considered it rather offensive. Perhaps thinking she was engaged in an act of sacrilege against the Khurts of Kerala, she had spoken out. She told her wife and father, saying that she had not rejected being the daughter of one of the Khurts. This, of course, entailed a lot of trouble in her family situation. The Bhartiya Karma Sena, for its part, has already taken to the streets on this issue with a group of three Kollam Millers in Kochi calling for Yagnik. A young woman from a Christian family said that she had made the decision to join the cause from an early age. When a \"Buddhist apologist\" came up in a Durga Puja procession and wrote offensive articles that questioned the Muslim faith on the internet, there was an angry uprising by the Christian community. But all this is drama, as no uprisings were heard anywhere in Kerala, or even off the call.The news today is that they will have a public prayer for the Muslim youth who have lost his life in the encounter, and that there will be a sampradaya, a vast demonstration on 27 August at Kulkarni. It's also worth mentioning, because in June last year, the CPM had begun a boycott of some local colleges, citing a planned protest at the college that would put out information about all three campuses of UGC. A pledge was made by the youth of UGC, regarding that no foreign loans would be paid to the CPM affiliated colleges for two years, and that the CPM would not take part in the college elections of a BJP government. However, the meeting in Kulkarni was to discuss the particular issue of Yagnik and not the college issue.In the end though, there wasn't really much to commiserate about as it appeared the khrts are all calling themselves Christians. The main reason being that most of them had little to lose if they chose to stay from the \"ghikkhunge\" altogether, and kept their Khurt hearts. It can therefore be expected that such folks would rally under a Mahayogi configuration. Not much say is then given as to what happens when their number comes to be seen in front of the dignity of the CPM in the Bangalore-Kurla meet, or the Odisha pre-Vijayayawada meet.That much was to be expected.\n\n_____________\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Tehelka's editorial policy.", "human": "Print Email to Friend | From Tehelka Magazine, Vol 8, Issue 12, Dated 26 Mar 2011 CURRENT AFFAIRS COVER STORY K Klutch Klan Friendship. Feuds. Betrayal. Mammoth corruption. Karunanidhi started out as the idealist with the silver tongue. This is the breathless story of how his family led him astray. And turned Tamil Nadu into a family estate ROHINI MOHAN reports IN THE summer of 1991, in a crowded political rally in Patna, thousands stirred impatiently as a portly Muthuvel Karunanidhi, in dark glasses, white shirt and dhoti, walked up to the podium. Expecting the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of the Dravidian movement to speak in nothing but chaste Tamil, people settled down to catch a few winks before the good Hindi stuff would begin. Unfazed, Karunanidhi adjusted the mike down to his height, cleared his throat and said in perfect English: \"Before I proceed with my speech I would like to introduce myself,\" he said. \"My name is Karunanidhi. I am anti-national... I am a dangerous person to this country.\" ILLUSTRATIONS: SAURABH DEB The shuffling stopped. Some people laughed nervously. Karunanidhi went on: \"Dear brothers and sisters, these are the titles conferred on me by a great patriot... Who is that great patriot? He is none other than Rajiv Gandhi.\" The rest of the speech was in Tamil, translated into Hindi by Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Rajmohan. Still, the audience listened, stunned. Just a month before, Karunanidhi was accused of supporting the separatist LTTE in Sri Lanka. His government was dismissed and President's Rule imposed, but that didn't stop him from using the situation to pull a public punch. When news of his speech reached TN, people were gobsmacked for another reason. Karunanidhi knew English?! Related Challenger Cometh?\n\nThe First Born's Winning Tantrum\n\nNew Tamil Ambassador in Capital\n\nThe first step to being a politician in Tamil Nadu, it is widely acknowledged, is to learn stagecraft \u2014 the ability to spin words that shock, rouse, or sweep you off your feet when you least expect it. And Karunanidhi \u2014 or Kalaignar (The Talented) as his sobriquet goes \u2014 is largely responsible for this. A Tamil film scribe, he learnt the art of argument from the early Dravidian leaders Periyar and C Annadurai. His speeches were witty, provocative and without fail, wellattended. The DMKwas known to sell tickets at his political rallies, which mobilised cadres from across the state for more than 60 years. Now 87, Karunanidhi has not lost a single election in his lifetime. And his success has ensured that fiery rhetoric is a pre-requisite for any Tamil political aspirant, from any party. If you step on stage, you're expected to wow. It was the most tangible test, sometimes more crucial than the elections themselves. Today, however, the most influential leaders in the DMK \u2014 Karunanidhi's children \u2014 do not pass that test. Sons MK Stalin and MK Azhagiri, daughter Kanimozhi and grandnephew Dayanidhi Maran are all, at best, lukewarm orators. They fumble and drawl, and their lines, even when written by salaried staff, are like a bland meal to an audience accustomed to better. Yet, in the last decade, especially in the current term of the DMK government, members of the first family have graduated from legislators to ministers, party members to party strategists, and most visibly, local politicians to national-level netas. The rules that bind every other politician in TN do not apply to them. It is not a mere matter of privilege, but of the kind of personal and financial takeover of a party and a state that breaks the limits of politics, and becomes simply about absolute control. Today, every time a person in Tamil Nadu switches on his television, reads the paper, buys groceries, purchases land, or watches a film, he has in some way engaged with one of Karunanidhi's relatives. The family is inescapable. And its influence does not even depend on whether or not it is in power. 'My name is Karunanidhi. I am anti-national. I am dangerous for this country.' With those words, the leader had the crowd gripped As the family's stranglehold deepens, its furious infighting has become difficult to conceal. Karunanidhi's daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi says, \"The leader always put the party before the family.\" (She, like all of Karunanidhi's children, refers to", "eta_suffix": "a regular guy.\" As a whole, Saliguri is demanding more action on all fronts and herself.

{"eta": "Hellknight Source Adventurer's Guide pg. 90, Inner Sea World Guide pg. 278\n\nNot all who start as novice armigers have what it takes to become mighty knights of Cyric.\n\n\nInquisitor's Challenge (Ex): At 3rd level, a armiger gains an exclusive Inquisitor's challenge, which occurs when she commits an act of terrible evil. Each time a kineticist attempts to overcome her armor, she must succeed at a DC 15 Will save. If she fails, her armor must be restored to full (for example, a dragon's scales to return her to full dragon form does not count). A kineticist's ability score value is doubled for the purpose of this feat. She also gains access to all feats that increase her arcane spell ranks.\n\n\nInquisitor's Relentless Assault (Ex): At 3rd level, once per day, a kineticist can fly into battle and gain a bonus on her energy drain check equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum +1). She can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. Using this ability counts as a swift action, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 9th level, this ability counts as a full-round action; at 17th level, this ability counts as an immediate action.\n\n\nThis ability replaces luck and blade barrier.\n\n\nFlawless Focus (Ex): At 5th level, each time a kineticist fails her save when she channels energy, she doesn't take any energy drained unless it would result in a negative amount. At 15th level, she doesn't lose the ability to gain energy drained from channeled energy if it would result in a negative amount; otherwise she must make a second save or take the negative amount. At 18th level, this ability replaces focus class feature.\n\n\nEldritch Armor (Ex): At 10th level, once per day as long as the kineticist's armor is changed into an eldritch armor she can use that armor while she is holding a medium weapon and she is wielding a two-handed or one-handed melee weapon. Only her arcane spell failure chance applies to the energy drain check. If the armiger loses the ability to wield the chosen weapon before or during use of this ability (because of a loss of arcane spell ranks, the kineticist loses her arcane spell ranks, the kineticist loses her blade barrier, the effects of a channeled negative energy attack the armiger received, the kineticist loses her eldritch armor or channeled energy, a visit to the Material Plane, or any other cause), the armiger cannot use the type of armor she gains as an armiger at that time.\n\n\nThe armiger can choose to take 2 additional standard actions when using her eldritch armor for the purpose of casting spells with somatic components; she must still receive as many normal actions as the action is required to cast the spell (which also doesn't limit the amount of material components needed). If she does so, she adds her armiger level to the total to determine how many actions she is limited to during the casting of such a spell. If the spell requires two additional standard actions, then the kineticist can't cast the spell again until after the round in which she took the other action.\n\n\nThis ability replaces poison use and arcana focus.\n\n\nHoly Ward (Ex): Beginning at 15th level, as long as the armiger has her eldritch armor she is immune to negative energy effects as well as the harm spells such as cure serious wounds, inflict moderate wounds, and release lightning bolt.\n\n\nThis ability replaces poison use and poison use class features.\n\n\nSilver Knight (Ex): At 20th level, whenever the kineticist generates an eldritch attack, or casts an eldritch spell with somatic components, she gains half her level for the duration of the spell.\n\n\nThis ability replaces armor training 1.\n\n\nIconic Weapon Training (Ex): At 25th level, the kineticist is equipped with legendary weapons wielded by archmagi and outsiders. At each level after 25 that the kineticist has hit level 25 with any arcane or divine spell, she can choose to gain one weapon from the following list. A legendary weapon must be specially crafted, attuned to a sorcerer or a divine spellcaster (but not an archmagi or outsiders), and it must have either the supernatural or the iconic properties. These are weapon type gains (gained at 5, 10, 15, and 20 levels from the kineticist) and are otherwise treated like standard weapons.\n\n\nPrimordial's Shadow : This weapon counts as a +1 alchemical and magical light crossbow for its light and two-handed types. This ability replaces energy focus. Holy Blade : This weapon counts as a +2 light crossbow for its light and two-handed types. This ability replaces gluttonous feast and resist energy 5. Absorb Energy (Su): At 20th level, once per", "topp": "Hellknight Source Adventurer's Guide pg. 90, Inner Sea World Guide pg. 278\n\nNot all who start as novice armigers have what it takes to become mighty knights of Cyric.\n\n\nInquisitor's Challenge (Ex): At 3rd level, a armiger gains an exclusive Inquisitor's Challenge feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 8th level, the Inquisitor's Challenge feat also applies to armigers who were never tied to Cyric. A single Inquisitor's Challenge feat can be chosen for all armigers. This ability replaces bravery.\n\n\nAssassin's Challenge (Ex): At 5th level, when a armiger successfully deals sneak attack damage against an opponent using the sneak attack ability, she gains the adrenaline surge ability. At 8th level, she also gains a sneak attack increase as normal, provided that her sneak attack increases at 5th level. In addition, any time a armiger makes a full attack action and her sneak attack increases, she can call upon the full power of her assassin's challenge ability. This ability functions as the hunter's dueling prowess class feature, except that a armiger can call upon it as long as she is adjacent to another creature (such as a monk, an inquisitor, or a bard). She cannot call upon it to increase her sneak attack bonus against an adjacent foe (such as a bard, a paladin, or a knight). At 15th level, the form grants her an additional sneak attack increase. This ability replaces the bard's dueling prowess, vigilante ranks, and rage powers gained at 5th, 8th, 15th, and 20th levels. This ability alters vigilante ranks. Oath of the Sons of Cyric Source Adventurer's Guide pg. 90\n\nThe armigers' devotion to the Ashnard clan that brings you to Cyric's court is no secret. You have done your part for the Exalted and their war effort.\n\n\nAshnard Symbol (Ex): At 5th level, you are permanently attuned to the Ashnard symbol which you received from the exalted family. You may obtain it as a free action using the armigers immediate action to gain the powers of the Ashnard symbols, which function as the symbol of the Exalted. This ability replaces bannermaker's declaration. Athasian Crusader Source Path of the Crusader pg. 22\n\nThese mighty warriors are warriors at heart, but they feel a mix of love and wrath for all men.\n\n\nFaithful Cavalry (Ex): At 5th level, a armiger gains a +2 bonus on the Leadership and Ride checks of equipping mounted companions. At 9th level, she gains +4 on those checks. This ability replaces sturdy horse. Tradition of the Conclave Source Inner Sea Primer pg. 63\n\nFor some, the armigers are a must. As as the method of temple outcast Kormrinn has tested, armigers are without peers in power and popularity within the pilgrim order.\n\n\nBakuda's Blessing (Su): At 3rd level, you gain the bakuda, which allows you to bring the sun into a temple to gain a deity's favor. Whenever you use a temple of a deity without the services of a temple watcher, you can make one worship check as a standard action at 6th level (2 times per day), 8th level (3 times per day), 12th level (4 times per day), and 16th level (5 times per day). In addition, as an immediate action, you can establish a temple with 1 or more armigers who are also members of the covenant as an extension of your temple. You can't set up a temple without the services of a temple watcher. This use of the bakuda is similar to an arcane bond spell, as the monks that take the bakuda can only do so for locales near them. A bakuda doesn't serve you directly, but they can function in your service without any complications. This ability replaces wish. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can change the area in which you and your armigers can establish a temple, from a 10-foot-wide corridor or 5-foot-deep tunnel to a 30-foot-wide corridor or 100-foot-deep tunnel. These new areas still offer resistance to cold, fire, or negative energy. This ability replaces bakuda. Blade of Regret (Su): Starting at 6th level, you become war's foremost non-cleric soldiers, as you enable you armigers to arm themselves without suffering a penalty to their armor class and without paying cost to do so. A bakuda is otherwise forbidden from initiating combat. This ability replaces bravery. Champion of Cyric (Ex): At 10th level, your chosen deity's favor is so potent that the armigers do not see a problem with serving you in times of need. As a standard action, you give a vow to your", "human": "Hellknight Source Adventurer's Guide pg. 90, Inner Sea World Guide pg. 278\n\nNot all who start as novice armigers have what it takes to become a full-fledged Hellknight, but those who do receive a wide array of abilities as they grow more powerful. While the individual powers and focus of a particular Hellknight vary according to his order, all Hellknights are universally feared and respected in regions where they maintain a presence. Most Hellknights are lawful neutral and proudly avoid being \"tainted\" by distractions such as good or evil, but some who rise in power shift toward tyrannical and cruel natures. Requirements To qualify to become a Hellknight, a character must fulfill the following criteria.\n\n\nAlignment: Any lawful.\n\nArmor Proficiency: Must be proficient with heavy armor.\n\nBase Attack Bonus: +5.\n\nSkills: Intimidate 5 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 2 ranks.\n\nSpecial: The character must slay a devil with Hit Dice greater than his character level. This victory must be witnessed by a Hellknight. Class Skills The Hellknight's class skills are Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).\n\n\nSkill Points at each Level: 2 + Int modifier.\n\nHit Die: d10. Class Features Level Base Attack Bonus Fort Save Ref Save Will Save Special 1st +1 +1 +0 +0 Aura of law, detect chaos, order, smite chaos 1/day 2nd +2 +1 +1 +1 Discern lies, Hellknight armor 1 3rd +3 +2 +1 +1 1st discipline, force of will 1 4th +4 +2 +1 +1 Smite chaos 2/day 5th +5 +3 +2 +2 Hellknight armor 2 6th +6 +3 +2 +2 2nd discipline, force of will 2 7th +7 +4 +2 +2 Lawbringer, smite chaos 3/day 8th +8 +4 +3 +3 Hellknight armor 3 9th +9 +5 +3 +3 3rd discipline, force of will 3, infernal armor 10th +10 +5 +3 +3 Hell's knight, smite chaos 4/day\n\nThe following are class features of the Hellknight.\n\n\nAura of Law (Ex): A Hellknight's lawful aura (see the detect law spell) functions as that of a cleric whose level is equal to the Hellknight's character level.\n\n\nDetect Chaos (Sp): This ability functions like the paladin's detect evil class feature, save that it grants the use of detect chaos instead.\n\n\nOrder: A character must choose one Hellknight order to join at 1st level (see page 89 for a list of orders). The choice of order determines which disciplines the character later gains access to.\n\n\nSmite Chaos (Su): This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil class feature but against chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.\n\n\nDiscern Lies (Sp): At 2nd level, a Hellknight can use discern lies as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier with a caster level equal to his character level.\n\n\nHellknight Armor (Ex): At 2nd level, a Hellknight earns the right to wear Hellknight plate (see page 97), which does not reduce his speed. While wearing this armor, the Hellknight reduces its armor check penalty by 1 and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1. At 5th level, these adjustments increase to 2. At 8th level, these adjustments increase to 3.\n\n\nDisciplines: At 3rd level, a Hellknight gains access to his first discipline, choosing one associated with his specific order. At 6th level, the Hellknight gains a second discipline, choosing from any listed as being available to \"any order.\" At 9th level, the Hellknight gains his third discipline, choosing this one from any of the disciplines listed below, even those from another order, with the exception of pentamic faith. When applicable, the save DC to resist a discipline's effect is equal to 10 + the Hellknight's level + his Charisma modifier. The Hellknight can use any one discipline a number of times per day equal to the total number of disciplines he has access to, so at 3rd level he can use his discipline once per day. At 6th level, he can use both disciplines twice per day each. At 9th level, he can use all three of his disciplines three times per day.\n\n\nSee here for a full list of Hellknight Disciplines.\n\n\n", "eta_suffix": "1 alchemical and magical light crossbow for its light and two-handed types.

{"eta": "This FAQ should help new readers better understand the crime, principals, cases, and our approach.\n\nOVERVIEW: On May 10 17, 2010, three Dupont Circle resident were killed in Baltimore County. The attacks targeted a 39 year old man and a 19 year old woman. But the individual and the victim only the location; the crime was considered terrorism.\n\nIn his response to the investigation, Baltimore County Police Maj. Keith Anstis stated \"In the 23 years I have been with this organization, this is the first homicide that I have handled. This is not a proactive operation involving this type of detail. We have gone off route and made the individuals we are after less visible.\"\n\nPolice continued to issue warnings to the community while and then after the murders. The calls that led to the investigation are discussed in detail here. All the work was done lawfully in accordance with State and Federal laws and directives. There is evidence and evidence and evidence of a federal crime and it was rooted in terrorism.\n\nIn a February 21, 2015 ruling by Magistrate Judge Barry Shatzberg that has never been given before, Judge Shatzberg found probable cause for the pretrial application of lethal force. By contrast, in a 23 year history of law enforcement killings on Baltimore County property, no case has reached this stage. One would think that a jurisdiction with one of the highest per capita murder rates in the nation would get the jump on terrorism?\n\nIn general, modern terrorism is characterized by:\n\n\u00b7 Symbolic attacks: An event or act that acts as a warning to others, often falsely, that imminent violence is about to occur. In terms of terrorism, the term \"false flag\" may refer to a public event or weapon of mass destruction that is falsely used in an attempt to instill fear that accomplices are not only present but will soon depart for the locale; it may include false reports of an impending aircraft attack similar to the one of September 11, 2001.\n\n\u00b7 Emotional responses to perceived threats by a collective group of individuals.\n\n\u00b7 Consequences are felt by the public through expensive insurance/spending choices and new tax laws.\n\n\u00b7 No terrorist organization will fail to realize it is the threat that causes the anxiety among individuals.\n\nThe method of attack may be varied (airplane, knife, bomb, or self harming weapons). The larger the group, the larger the inutility of the method. In a terrorist event, all will be a witness to it. Remember, everyone takes a risk when driving a car in this country, but are the same risk when doing likewise in a terrorist scenario? The logic of the equation, however, is that the more frequent and costly the ensuing event, the more valuable the safety. A single action is proportionate to everyone's potential safety loss; the right to self-defense may be denied by individuals when those individuals are prepared, but when there is no one to protect, not even those on the other side.\n\nHow does terrorism apply in Baltimore County? It is an attack against the public. A violent attack on an individual cannot have any long term payoff. For this reason, the attack must be either a misdemeanor or felony and deal with direct impact to a person or group of persons. Local authorities must always act to make these attacks as short and as violent as possible, lest they create an ill-feelin. Ultimately, the balance between prevention and consequence is the lone wolf/assailant dilemma. The FBI calls this vulnerability \u2013 \"network foreshortening.\" This vulnerability might have been most easily exploited by a lone wolf when the crime took place in an area that has limited public law enforcement presence. In such circumstances, even an undercover cop in a proscribed vehicle will not be able to approach the attack like any other law enforcement officer in town. Today, such a crime would normally be a felony if a \"semi-pro\" could be present. The sad reality is that there are no ultra-pros in Maryland, and federal law enforcement personnel cannot enter state courthouses without being apprehended or facing felony charges.\n\nAlthough Baltimore County Police utilize a number of tactics to deter terrorism, they have far more at stake with respect to public safety than any individual citizen's personal safety. Threats and homicides and arrests have created a level of suspicion in the community that no member of the community is able to overcome. These fears are even more pronounced when the fear is directed towards the law enforcement officers. Even when it comes to the fear of terrorism, nobody considers public safety.\n\nThe motivation for the terrorism comes from a critique of the United States government and government perceived values. In this sense, a certain establishment values society, especially the middle class, versus the remaining and poor. The purpose of terrorism and the allegedly implied crime is to frame a society in a negative light, which supposedly damages, taints, and \"delegitimizes those values.\" The history of our country, as well as that of the United States,", "topp": "This FAQ should help new readers better understand the crime, principals, cases, and our approach.\n\nOVERVIEW: On May 10 17, 2010, three Dupont Circle resident when stopped for a seatbelt violation at Eatsa in Dupont Circle, Maryland (known officially as Lamb Ha Ha and known more officially as Ihgali's), and provided the following statements as evidence:\n\n1. I am not a wife. My name is Yahya Ayyub, and I am a Muslim. In fact, I am a proud member of the Muslim religion.\n\n2. \"Let me tell you something, you guys should look good wearing that Kangol, if you can't stretch it out, you look horrible.\"\n\n3. \"Watch your back, it's only me.\"\n\nHaving no logical doubt that this piece of a jihadi propaganda film was made in the U.S.A., or in any other country besides a place where Muslims make up fewer than 1% of the population, the WBC team proceeded to make hay out of an unidentified car that appeared on several interior screens on other courts watching the broadcast. As we know, according to the FBI, 85% of the actual automobile-related hate crimes are committed by U.S. Muslim extremists. It was about the only vehicle on that particular playlist that was ever captured that day. It was not terror-creating.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

(That produced a second ad, which stopped production when the neo-Nazi Vitesse public TV show complained about it on national TV.) That's how fundamentally disconnected the BLT grew from the country it was projected for.\n\nWhen the Director asked one of the trial jurors whose testimony was broadcast, \"Can you step forward?\" she hesitated.\n\n\"Well, I'll be happy to do that.\"\n\nThe Director then asks another juror who is seated opposite the Director, \"Thank you very much\" and reassures her that she'll be fair.\n\nSeemingly unharmed, she takes the stand to begin her testimony, but when she begins to speak, she makes the error of adding \"Oh, well, I'll have to say that not only I thought it was negative content, but so did a great many of the PTA members from our neighborhood.\" (\"Like 4-H, Christian New Year, your mom, etc.\") She puts her hand in her chest and interrupts herself several more times, never bothering to look up and mispronounces \"Mrazi\"\u2014i.e., \"name of a person.\"\n\nFinally, she is asked if she thought the hearing was right for the Judge, and she says yes. This is her last courtroom appearance, before she is released on bail.\n\nMid-trial, Tsarnaev's main assistant, Dasayev, informs the Judge that he has found an invisible Internet connection connected to Tsarnaev's computer at 29th and U, and that the connection is in the control of two other people, including \"High School Student Rebecca Scott.\"\n\nRegarding the original broadcast, particularly the bit about Haines, Dasayev's testimony says:\n\n\"He offered to smash my head, but I stopped him. And, when he gave me the check he hoped to redeem, I said, 'Don't give it to me, give it to your ex-wife.' He said, 'Thank you. I thought I saw it in the TV that something bad happened to you.' That's why when he took it from me in his hand, he dropped it \u2026 he put it in his pocket \u2026 something which is a senseless act in the eyes of a third person, but for me, a man with family, it was my consciousness; it was my freedom. I took a weapon of war that [Tamerlan] had the beautiful ability to use and while he was drawing, I stabbed him (Bubinski?) five times, because I held a stake in my heart. The blood flowed, and \u2026 if a bigger man could have inflicted the same fate \u2026 he would have \u2026 you know.\"\n\nBut he could not. That new, silent, inverse, evil person remained before this White jury, controlling an American TV audience no less, for what was expected to be the entirety of Tsarnaev's guilty or indeterminate sentence.

Robert, a DC attorney who lived in Oakton, Virginia, had arranged weeks earlier to spend the night at the home of his college friend Joe Price.\n\nAt the time, Price lived with his registered domestic partner Victor Zaborsky and their 'roommate' Dylan Ward. The three housemates, all gay, were at home when the murder occurred and from that night forward have claimed an unknown 'intruder' broke into their home and killed their straight friend.\n\nAn apparent flawed investigation (that included DC Police, the FBI and US Secret Service), and at times, a lethargic prosecution allowed this case to go for years without substantive progress made towards finding Robert's killer.\n\nIn October, 2008, the first charges were leveled. The prosecution alleged that Robert was injected by a paralytic drug, sexually assaulted, restrained, stabbed, washed, redressed and placed into bed before the housemates dialed 911.\n\nOn May 10, the housemates will go on trial at DC Superior Court, but they are not being tried for murder. Instead, they are charged with crime scene tampering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice (lying to and misdirecting investigators). Prosecutors believe the defendants know who committed the murder and they're covering up for the killer.\n\nESSENTIAL READING: Start with the Robert Wone Wiki page for an overview of the principals and charges. Other key documents include:\n\nThe 'original' affidavit: This was the 14 page arrest warrant for Dylan Ward that was released in October, 2008. Written from the prosecution's perspective, it contains many accusations that are graphic and sexual in nature.\n\nThe Superseding Indictment: This prosecution document outlines the alleged overt acts which constitute the criminal charges.\n\nWard Motion for Pretrial Release: Written by Ward's defense team, this document describes what they found to be heavy-handed tactics by the police and government in their investigation and prosecution of Ward and his housemates.\n\nTranscripts of defendants' interview with DC Police detectives on the night of the murder: Price, Ward, Zaborsky. Videotapes of the interviews are here:\n\nPrice: Part 1; Part 2; Part 3 Ward: Part 1; Part 2; Part 3 Zaborsky: Part 1; Part 2; Part 3\n\nTwo key pieces of reporting: The Washington Post's two \u2013 part June 2006 series by Paul Duggan and Harry Jaffe's Washingtonian Magazine feature from April 2010.\n\n1: Who are you guys, and why are you doing this?\n\nFor nearly two decades the four of us have been friends, partners and exes; together we are each other's family of choice. Over an early December dinner we realized we shared a serious and driven interest in this case and strong desire to see the truth emerge about the murder of an incredible young man. We also shared the frustration that his murder has languished for years with a glacially slow legal process and little substantive investigative media coverage.\n\nAs four guys who make their livings in and around the media we also were drawn to this case by its ingredients typical of a full blown Washington scandal; power, sex, alleged drug use,and mystery. So why such little real buzz on the streets? There seemed to be a tremendous void.\n\nWe launched whomurderedrobertwone.com to re-energize the conversation, spark more debate, provide a clearinghouse and to grow the number of people who can lend smart analysis and want to see justice done.\n\nWe aggregate the media coverage as well as offer original commentary, research and analysis of the case. Our editorial framework demands a 360 look at all aspects and principals involved. We ask for guest commentary and encourage a free flowing conversation and the sharing of responsible ideas and opinions.\n\nMany of the topics are of an adult and graphic nature. These issues cannot be discussed solely in a clinical manner and often the language needed to address the aspects of this case and crime requires us to give wide berth to accommodate the views from different and diverse audiences.\n\n2: Why no aliases?\n\nBecause we want to operate as transparently as possible we freely use our names: Craig Brownstein, David Greer, Michael Kremin and Doug Johnson.

I'm not saying that this will be a global solution. I'm not saying that it doesn't need some forms of control. I'm saying that it's the primary role on which we're looking at in the not too distant future.\n\n\nI know what you're thinking: \"Just because they have that crap, they can't fix it?\" I think that's like saying \"Just because you have a treat, they can't fix it.\" I think that's too harsh a statement...and I have to say, having as many skins as we do in the game, will actually benefit from 2nd party game mode/update (compare to say, like a vanilla title that only has 4).\n\n\nRight now 3rd party skins are put in an impossible situation. In order to release skins to the people who don't want them, it'll require the devs to cover issues for people who do want skins. That's tough. I don't think it will be hard for 3rd party developers and devs to find that some way of patching/sorting skins should be used in order to encourage game modes and updates to become available faster, and to the extent possible be up to date.\n\n\nGiven the size of the pool of 3rd party skins (I think 300-400 in-game at this point) then there's good reason to think that some form of game-patching / type of distribution/enabled-skin-patching could become feasible sooner rather than later.\n\n\nThe other interesting question I have is, will there be an already implemented game mode or patch that would allow us to patch/sort skins to as close a base as we possibly can? Given the huge scalability and flexibility of what we can do, it may well be that game modes, game updates and skins are a concern of not only the 3rd party developer, but of the entire industry as a whole.\n\n\nI'd like to know what your thoughts on what such a game-patching method would mean, and what you believe 3rd party developers need to do in order to become a viable development option, in order for you to back the project yourself.\n\n\nAgain, in order to have 100% efficient game modes, update and patches we need to assume that anyone who wants a skin, is going to try to play with the game (once it is available), and that the game developers (who may have technical knowledge and some ability in game-patching / distribution/enabled-skin-patching) are going to be highly motivated to make that game modes the ideal/most efficient way to integrate their content.I know what you're thinking: \"Just because they have that crap, they can't fix it?\" I think that's like saying \"Just because you have a treat, they can't fix it.\"\n\nUser Info: kasplat360 kasplat360 (Topic Creator) 1 year ago #2 You are right, but I think that's the closest we'll be with 3rd party game mode and skins eventually. This wouldn't be a true game mode/update until the developers on those areas are on board. I would love if there was some other game-mode/update we could use that has more potential of being implemented sooner rather than later..that is 100% efficient game mode and patch.\n\nUser Info: nnash nnash 1 year ago #3\n\n\nI think a system similar to Valve's Golden Keys would suit most teams out there, if they want to have their own skins.\n\nNow, where things may get tricky is how effectively a game-patching system, can be implemented and created for skins.

I'm not saying that this will be a global solution. I'm not saying that it doesn't need some forms of control. I'm saying that it's the primary role of a competitive league of legends player to not suddenly start playing league of legends while losing 70% of their bankroll and switching to something that isn't (in essence) 3rd party game content.\n\n\nTwo things already have been put forward, a solution to itemized items and marketplace support. This is a very innovative idea that I think we're at least on the verge of seeing make a large impact on the competitive scene. 2nd, while gear helps (compared to say, character rankings), the core point is that it's not the same thing as having tons of currencies. Each time you spend on gear, it actually boosts your character's stats and gives you extra stats as well. This is something that is something that we can all get behind as a concept. I think we'd be more sympathetic with these players who feel that items are \"worthitly\" or \"okay\", than those who think they are \"worthless\" or \"too costly to use\", because their stomps are up to waste.\n\n\nGiven the size of the pool we're working with, it's unlikely we will be able to allow anyone to reduce the number of skins that can be purchased at any given time. The only way to reduce that down to a number that would be within our control is if we could somehow force people to buy skins from the market or whatever, and could also choose to only allow large multiboxer players in the challenger league access to skins as opposed to large mono-bloc players. I think it's going to be hard to do both of those things, but that's not for me to say.\n\n\nYou get points for existing 3rd party skins, but you may not get the best gear. 3rd party skins are far more valuable than unassigned player tbh, and some of the purchase process, like granting XP based on how many total queued games you've performed and some of the ways in which you earn currency when you acquire skins, definitely need work. I think that's something that could certainly be done in a more friendly way. See, champions currently cost a lot of points. Reapers of Cinder 6 to 10 aren't cheap, compared to a champion costing around 10-15 points and a item costing like 75.5 points. It only makes sense to charge more than this for a piece of clothing, in this case a 3rd party skin. However, just because a person has access to 3rd party skins doesn't mean he's going to be much better off. I do see this as the first step towards an effort to better support the poor and/or low player level skins, to better encourage large-scale, multibox players to be better players overall.

Uh, later dudes. S you in your As. Don't wear a C and J all over your Bs. I know in the GBA era the cost was about $4 per cart...

You are bawling like a baby there at your Mac. Randy: They got a divorce. After all those years of hard work and building a future together they go and get a divorce. Gary: Oh wow. I'm so sorry man. Is it your folks? Randy: No, they divorced when I was like three. Like I'd still be crying about that. What kind of weepy jerk do you think I am? I'm talking about my Sim family the Spudheads. After working so hard on them they went and split up on me. Gary: You really do need therapy, my friend. Randy: I poured my love and attention into their house. I bought them nice things. Even an iMac! Gary: At least you are sane when it comes to computers. Randy: I added rooms to their house. I put in a pool in the backyard for Pete's sake! Gary: Sounds like your Sims have a better pad than we do. Randy: I even gave them other people to play with. Who wouldn't be happy living right next door to a house full of lesbian roommates? Who!? I ask you!? Gary: Uh, I think I am beginning to see where your Spudhead household may have gone wrong. Just backup and explain for the edification of our readers exactly how you created this utopia on acid called the Spudhead house. Randy: Well, as you know my, latest addiction has been The Sims from Aspyr and ported to the Mac by Westlake Interactive. Gary: Hummm, I would have thought it was Krispy Kreme Doughnuts judging by the boxes all over your end of the cave, but do go on. Randy: The Sims is the people simulator from Maxis, the original creators of Sim City. And much like Sim City your goal is to simulate real life, but on a much smaller scale. Gary: How small are we talking here, like sea monkeys small? Randy: More like on a neighborhood scale. You can populate a neighborhood with prefab Sim families or create families of your own. And when I say families I use the term loosely. You can have just one person in a \"family\" or several people in a \"nontraditional family\", such as my lovely family of four women, the Bootycallers. Gary: The Bootycallers. That's nice. I'm sure Mrs. Spudhead was just thrilled when \"the Bootycaller\" girls moved in next door.\n\n\nA Sim is born! Randy: Oddly enough she was not. But I tried to make all the girls in the Bootycall house outgoing and playful so they'd make friends. When you create a new person in The Sims you can control five personality traits all in all. Neat, Outgoing, Active, Playful and Nice. And believe me it's pretty important to try and balance your Sims traits or you will wind up with unexpected personalities. Gary: Let me guess. The playful girls at the Bootycall house are not much for neatness. Randy: Yeah, it got so bad they refused to go inside the house after a few weeks. But they loved to hang out at the Spudhead's house. Gary: Sure, why not. They have a pool! Randy: Exactly! Gary: I hope you didn't put a gun in the Spudhead's house, because I would imagine Mrs. Spudhead is going right for it about this time. Randy: Because The Sims is a family game there are no firearms available, and no nudity for that matter. Naked Sims in the bathroom are discretely fuzzed out. Gary: Dang! Randy: But there are plenty of other things you can buy for your Sims if you have the cash. In fact the nicer you make your Sims digs the happier they are. And the whole point of the game is to keep your Sims happy, washed and well fed. After you pick your family you move them into a house or you can buy an empty lot and build your house from scratch. But you only get twenty thousand bucks to start the game.\n\nSure the place is small but you can always add more rooms later. Gary: Actually you don't get dollars you get 20 K of Sim money called, Simoleons, of course. Randy: Right. And that money has to buy everything you need to get started. Beds, chairs, bathtubs, sinks, lights, coffee maker and lava lamp. Everything. I had to start my houses off modestly. But once my Sims looked in the newspaper and surfed the web on their computers, they got jobs and started making money.

There are no skill requirements for this Distraction and Diversion, but more points can be acquired at certain level thresholds.\n\nGuthixian Cache requires the player to hop into an energy rift, found at any of the wisp colonies (except the pale wisp and cursed wisp colonies) which appear for 10 minutes hourly, to collect memories of Guthix. While it appears every hour, the extra benefits for Divination only occur once every 3 hours. It can also be entered via The Archivist in the Hall of Memories.\n\nThe fastest way to get to an open energy rift is by using a ring of duelling to teleport to the Mobilising Armies area and running north. The second fastest method is teleporting to Falador via the lodestone and then running east.\n\nTime until start 26 minutes Time until boosts start 146 minutes (wrong?)\n\nContents show]\n\nOverview Edit\n\nWhen the cache is ready, all capable colonies will have their rifts widen, and the rocks that usually hover above the green vortexes shall disappear, and these whirl become glowing portals. At that point it's possible to jump inside the crater to reach the Cache.\n\nArriving there, players will find themselves in a large ancient room, full of roots laying over walls that hide some kind of old-fashioned machinery behind. A large doorway is blocked, with roots and debris. At the very centre of the room a raging and turbulent vortex swirls the green energy of the Anima Mundi. Within many shelves in the walls, are bottles of different sizes, from tiny to large, containing the precious memories of Guthix. The same way Divination is practised around Gielinor, those memories must be thrown into the rifts to ease the damage the soul of the world has suffered after the assassination of Guthix and its following events.\n\nAround the room, Automatons scan the area, in order to protect the memories of the Lord of Balance, and to prevent any intruders from taking them away. Despite the memories needing to be taken to heal the wounds of the world, these creatures do not understand that, and tackle the player if carrying the bottles, considering them invaders. To subdue them and freely offer the memories into the unstable rift, players must assume the form of Cres, the deceased overseer of automatons, one of the Guardians of Guthix and the only one capable of disarming his former subordinates.\n\nThe Guthixian Cache opens every hour on the hour, and lasts for 10 minutes.\n\nSubduing Edit\n\nTo subdue automatons, players can select the \"Transform\" option available by clicking one of the four Statues of Cres located in the four corners of the room. Players will then assume the Power of Cres which transforms the player into Cres and grants the ability to temporarily subdue NPC automatons. There are three types of automatons that can be subdued. (The required levels can be boosted.)\n\nThe cache always contains eight ancient automatons and two confused and enraged automatons.\n\nPlayers can only stay transformed for 60 seconds until the Power of Cres fades or if they click on the statue again. Once players return to their normal state, they must wait another 60 seconds before assuming power from a Statue of Cres again.\n\nIf players log out or hop worlds, and reenter before the cache ends, they will remain in the arena but Cres cooldown will reset and will be forced to wait another 60 seconds. Accumulated points will be kept, but the automaton and converted memory count will reset, possibly lengthening the time before power ups can be used.\n\nConverting Edit\n\nTo earn points for converting memories, players must first grab a memory from any of the deposits on the walls. The player must have both hands free to be able to carry memories, and may only carry one memory at a time. Once the player has a memory, they must run to the centre of the cache and deposit the memory into the unstable rift without being attacked by an active automaton. If a player runs into an active automaton during their journey to the centre of the room, the automaton will swipe the memory out of the player's hands, causing the jar to smash to the ground.\n\nIf the player deposits the memory just as an automaton is about to swipe the memory from them, the memory will not be lost and points will be gained.

{"eta": "Free Bet Profit Explained\n\nIn 'Step 4 - Profiting From Free Bets' we said that you will make between \u00a39 to \u00a315 from a \u00a320 Free Bet.\n\nIn this guide we shall assume you have placed \u00a320 at the Free Bets and that you are looking to make \u00a380 from your Free Bet profits.\n\nStep 1 - Max Aims (Estimated Profit Percentage)\n\nWe will use the Profit Tracker to calculate your expected profit when you place this bet. This calculator is available online at Odds Fortnight.\n\nYour expected profit is then calculated as shown below using these 'Actual Profit' calculations:\n\nActual Profit % = PtsBet Averaged\n\nPts Bet Profit / (Bets Averaged \u2013 AvgPts Bet) = Bet Profit\n\nActual Profit = Optimum Bet Profit\n\nActual Profit = Optimum Bet Profit + Optimum Bet Profit Profit Estimate\n\nActual Profit = Profit Factor - Optimum Bet Profit\n\nActual Profit = Profit Factor (Optimum Bet Profit / (Bets Averaged \u2013 AvgPts Bet) %) = Optimum Bet Profit/Optimum Bet Profit Profit Estimated Profit Percentage = Profit Factor (Optimum Bet Profit / (Bets Averaged \u2013 AvgPtsBet) %) = Profit Factor\n\nThe Actual Profit Percentage can be calculated using the 'Actual Profit Formula' which you can find in my detailed guide: Ultimate Bonus Player's Guide. (click here to download)\n\nYou may like my In-Depth Free Bet Guide for more details.\n\nLet's have a break down of the different calculators from the Money Tips section:\n\nActual Bet Price Calculator - The ideal \"baseball free bet calculator\" that will estimate the Bet Price you can expect when you place your bet. But it's also very important to remember that while this calculator will explain in a detailed fashion exactly how much you can make from a free bet, there will be some calculators that are more inclined to allow you to make more money if you use them, while the \"baseball free bet calculator\" will advise you how much you actually need to bet to make a profit and where you should set your money limit. The calculator will show you what the 100% Risk for each product is, and how much you should bet to achieve a profit (if there is any). Overall, I think it is a good one to follow.\n\nActual Profit Calculator - A similar to the Profit Tracker as explained in the Money Tips section, while this calculator can give you an indication of your Optimum Bet Profit and how much you need to bet if you want to make a profit, it does not explain how much to bet to get the optimal result. It does however show you how much to bet towards your Optimum Bet Profit, based on the Risk/Apotability equation that is described. Ultimately this guide will try to show you how much to bet to achieve a profit.\n\nOptimum Bet Profit Calculator - This is similar to the Optimum Bet Profit Calculator as explained in the Money Tips section, but this calculator also gives you an indication of how much you actually need to bet to achieve a profit. Similarly to the Profit Tracker, this calculator gives you all the data including the Actual Bet Price you can expect when you place your bet. While it is useful when you are unsure, personally I don't rate it as a top choice. It will not help you find out what exactly the Optimum Bet Profit is, but rather how much you are paying for it. Therefore I don't think it is worth using this calculator as a guide to look after yourself.\n\nOptimum Bet Calculator - This is an alternative to the Optimum Bet Profit Calculator as explained in the Money Tips section. It is by far the safest and most accurate bet calculator available, but will give you an indication of the amount of money you pay out for each bet you place. Again this calculator will show you the amount of bet each product costs you per year, which I have highlighted in bold letters. This is the base case scenario, so it may be worth adding your Optimum Bet Profit Formula if you really want to find out what you are paying for.\n\nDiscount Calculator - This is a common tool that can be added to your Bargain Box account to help you figure out what to buy with your profit. However, as I explained in the Profit Optimizer guide - it's also something I do not recommend to use as a guide to look after yourself.\n\nStep 2 - Optimize Your Account\n\nIn this section we have chosen to use the Profit Optimizer to improve our strategy to maximize our profits - it's especially useful for players who also have a buffer in their Bankroll and in particular, that are looking to play less frequently - as this is something we all want to avoid.\n\nYou may wish to try this out in your Free Checking Account. If you", "topp": "Free Bet Profit Explained\n\nIn 'Step 4 - Profiting From Free Bets' we said that you will make between \u00a39 to \u00a315 from a \u00a320 Free Bet.\n\nIn this guide we will cover those who profit from Free Bets, there are three ways you can earn money from Free Bets -\n\nBecoming a Privately Owned Bank\n\nBuying Millionaire Accounts and Ladder Winnings\n\nFinancing Transactions with any type of Investing\n\n1. Becoming a Privately Owned Bank\n\nMany More People (especially people from higher socio-economic groups and those playing poker professionally) are becoming private owner banks.\n\nThis is great, although you will need to be very patient and set aside time to do it right.\n\nAs a Privately Owned Bank, you will have their proprietary banking and transaction information stored in safe deposit boxes.\n\nThis information can now be monitored and conducted to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\n2. Buying Millionaire Accounts and Ladder Winnings\n\nThe MoneySmart Official MoneyBook, in a great new report, has picked out the top 50 Millionaire Accounts from across the poker World.\n\nIf you're serious about your Millionaire's and are a professional, earning top prize money, you can learn more from them with this guide.\n\nAs you apply to become a millionaire account, you will be required to demonstrate your intentions and justify why you would have a need of such an account.\n\nIf you are allocated a Millionaire account, you are then required to apply to fill the Millionaire Roll. This will open your account up to the public and their data is fully secured.\n\n3. Financing Transactions with any type of Investing\n\nMany of today's independent poker players require all of their funds to be invested in a bank and bookmaker.\n\nThis is standard practice nowadays. Unfortunately, most of the public is not aware of this service and not seeking a bank account.\n\nPoker players can now do their own banking by investing in a service such as Central Bank, Private Deposit Company (PDC) or a private player.\n\nBy actually adding funds to your poker account, and investing in a betting platform, you will increase your banking knowledge and therefore earn more from your gambling expenses.\n\nPlease ensure you invest at least \u00a310,000 (if your play is generally considered well worth it) into a suitable player's mutual account, as we explain below.\n\nPlease be careful, doing someone else's money without verifying the accounts you're filling can cause problems, as well as jeopardise your bank account in future.\n\nMoneySmart Official MoneyBook\n\nTo get on the MoneySmart Official MoneyBook list of poker accounts please provide proof that you have obtained a Poker Licence and can prove your net profit potential.\n\nPoker Dealer Account Funded Banking Benefits\n\nIf you have a committed poker player friendly poker team that take good care of you - even if it's just a couple of backs in a night - they will appreciate you taking care of them.\n\nThis is because they remember that you've given them a decent checking account like the MoneySmart Official MoneyBook.\n\nTaking care of the finances of a mate gives them confidence and helps them build their playing records.\n\nIf you're another poker company client, and find they are taking they's ordinary business card banking to his and her poker team, understand that the playing floor is pretty populated with the average player.\n\nIf this same player is sporting a serious card playing background, they will often stick close to someone known to have proven himself, to ensure the integrity of the playing floor.\n\nThis group of poker professionals can encourage and validate other poker players's potential and make their gaming careers legitimate.\n\nThis is why we still see millionaires and players of many other game types, receiving 1-5m player minimum pay out for their services, over and over again.\n\nThis is also why they always seem to remain new to the poker world.\n\nWith a range of special services available, and continually improving our platform as we hear your requests, we plan to become more than just the name, this includes a wealth of professional and professional exclusive services that we deliver.\n\nHelpful Links\n\nBudgeting Poker and Financial assistance\n\nGet free basic Financial Education with Financial Premier!\n\nDFU Financial Project - Acquiring financial literacy - PDF (Advanced Financial Planning)\n\nDFU Financial Project - Winning Poker Tournament Winnings - PDF (Latest Financial programs)", "human": "Free Bet Profit Explained\n\nIn 'Step 4 - Profiting From Free Bets' we said that you will make between \u00a39 to \u00a315 from a \u00a320 free bet, depending on the odds you choose. Here is a table from the Coral offer showing this.\n\n\u00a320 Free Bet\n\nBack Odds Betfair\n\nLiability Your Profit\n\n(% conversion) 2.0 \u00a311 \u00a39 (45%) 3.0 \u00a330 \u00a312 (60%) 4.0 \u00a350 \u00a313 (65%) 5.0 \u00a365 \u00a314 (70%) 6.0 \u00a390 \u00a315 (75%)\n\nAs you can see from the above table, if we choose odds of 2.0, our \u00a320 free bet converts to \u00a39 cash, which is 45% conversion from free bet to cash. Whereas if we choose odds of 6.0, our \u00a320 free bet converts to \u00a315 cash, which is a 75% conversion from free bet to cash.\n\nIn this optional article, we explain the why higher odds means higher profit and run through an example.\n\nWhy Higher Odds = Higher Profit?\n\nIf our \u00a320 free bet wins, we do not receive the \u00a320 stake back as part of our winnings.\n\nTherefore, by betting on a dead cert, we are limiting our winnings to a small amount given our \u00a320 stake is not returned.\n\nWhereas if we bet on team with high odds that could make us \u00a3100+, we can make a big profit as our \u00a320 stake is quite small in comparison to our winnings. The only consideration with high odds, is it requires a higher liability in Betfair Exchange.\n\nGimme an example with low odds!\n\nSure, let's say we use our Coral \u00a320 free bet on England to beat Russia. The odds are 1.95:\n\nOur winnings if England win are:\n\n\u00a320 x 1.95 = \u00a339\n\nminus our \u00a320 free bet stake = \u00a319\n\nTo guarantee a profit, we use matched betting by placing a lay bet on Betfair Exchange. With lay odds of 1.99:\n\nWe can enter these 3 numbers (\u00a320, 1.28, 1.35) into the Calculator, remembering to use 'Free Bet SNR' in the dropdown:\n\nThis shows us by using odds of 1.95 our guarantee profit is \u00a39.30 from our \u00a320 free bet.\n\nOn the plus side we only need \u00a39.69 in our Betfair account, being the liability.\n\nGreat that I make \u00a39.30, but where actually is my profit?\n\nIt simply depends on whether your bookmaker or exchange bet win:\n\nAs you can see from the above table:\n\nIf England win, we win our Coral free bet for \u00a319 winnings, but lose our Betfair \u00a39.69 liability. This give us a net profit of \u00a39.31.\n\nIf England do not win (draw or Russia win), we lose our Coral free bet (costs us nothing), but win our Betfair \u00a39.79 lay bet. Deducting the 5% commission, this gives us a net profit of \u00a39.30.\n\nGimme an example with high odds!\n\nNo problem, let's say we use our Coral \u00a320 free bet on Ukraine to beat Germany. The odds are 6.0:\n\nOur winnings if Ukraine win are:\n\n\u00a320 x 6 = \u00a3120\n\nless our \u00a320 free bet stake = \u00a3100\n\nTo guarantee a profit, we use matched betting by placing a lay bet on Betfair Exchange. With lay odds of 6.4:\n\nWe can enter these 3 numbers (\u00a320, 6, 6.4) into the Calculator, remembering to use 'Free Bet SNR' in the dropdown.\n\nThis shows us by using odds of 6.0 our guarantee profit is now \u00a314.95 from our \u00a320 free bet.\n\nJust be wary that we need \u00a385.05 in our Betfair account, being the liability.\n\nEven better that I make \u00a314.95, but where actually is my profit?\n\nExactly the same as the previous example, it simply depends on whether your bookmaker or exchange bet win:\n\nAs you can see from the above table:\n\nIf Ukraine win, we win our Coral free bet for \u00a3100 winnings, but lose our Betfair \u00a385.05 liability.

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio was $80 million, and the Company expects to remain at or below that level for the foreseeable future.\nOther Commitments\nOn April 11, 2016, the Company announced that it had a $230 million contingent commitment made as consideration for the assumption of certain obligations, including certain liabilities, arising from former Walmart international business activities, that the Company was required to assume when it acquired Walmart International, Inc. in May 2015 and June 2015. The Company then terminated this contingent commitment because it was determined, based on the information available, that the Company's expectation of concluding its domestic business did not warrant the further continuation of the contingent commitment. The commitments at issue for the Walmart International acquisition consisted primarily of certain licensing obligations, plant and equipment. For the purposes of determining the Company's ordinary course of business, the Company's commitment to make payments under the prior commitments is expected to be amortized over the related commitments of the Company under the current commitments as described below. The Company recognizes the commitment at a fair value of $80 million at the balance sheet date. In addition, there are accrued capital lease obligations of $45 million under the purchase and leaseback plan that the Company is entering into during the year. As part of the acquired Walmart International subsidiaries, the Company owns the intellectual property, including patents, design and trade secret rights, underlying the manufacturing and distribution of certain Walmart International products.\nThe carrying amount of these contingent obligations is expected to be amortized over the expected term of the related arrangements, which are expected to be four years, beginning in the second quarter of 2017. The Company plans to continue its existing indebtedness under the previously announced standby letters of credit, consisting of $45 million of unsecured senior unsecured senior notes due 2018 and $60 million of unsecured senior unsecured notes due 2019.\nThe carrying amount of the purchase and leasing obligations reported in the consolidated balance sheets as of April 30, 2016 is as follows:\nOrdinary course of business $ 527\n\nCommitments not accounted for as either cash flow hedges or other hedges:\n\n(In millions, except share and per share data) (\" Non- cashable \" ) 0\n\nConstant currency commitments $ 3,504\n\nTotal $ 5,160\n\nCommitments that are not accounted for as both cash flow hedges or other hedges and that are not included in other liabilities, deferred payments, net, which are designated as continuing-loans with a loan carrying amount of $1,567 and $3,450, respectively, are:\n\nFiscal year ended\n\nApril 30, 2016 2015 2012 US$ $ 8,856\n\n$ 7,045\n\n$ 6,293\n\nOther liabilities 2,144\n\n1,973\n\n1,868\n\nTotal $ 2,146\n\n$ 1,959\n\n$ 1,812\n\nOther Assets\n\nCash is invested primarily in the US and in foreign currencies or US Dollars for the purposes of hedging and obtaining foreign exchange rate flexibility.

(b) totaling up to $1.85B and from there we adjust down for taxes (there are NOLs at TPCA) but those are almost entirely offset by the expected sales price of the Aruba resort.\u00a0 The footnote at the bottom, even if Aruba is valued at $0 then the total consideration is estimated at $1.77B or $74.26 per share, still a decent spread from today's price. Tropicana Aruba is a fairly small operation, its a short walk from the beach (read: not beachfront) on 14 acres with 360 hotel rooms they've been renovating and converting into timeshare units over the past several years, there's also a 4000 sq ft casino property that mirrors what you see at a many Caribbean resorts.\u00a0 In the financials, Aruba gets lumped in with their Baton Rouge and Greenville casinos making it difficult to determine what the property is worth, but at the $1.85B headline number its being valued at $80MM.\u00a0 That feels high, but maybe I'm anchoring to the original thinking that Aruba was simply an option to build a larger property. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2018, if we call the range of potential (positive) outcomes $74.26 - $77.61 on today's close of $69.75 that's a 6.5% - 11.2% absolute return in less than 9 months.\u00a0 Unfortunately I sold last year into the tender, but given my comfort with the company and the attractive deal spread, I repurchased a position today. From the buyers perspective, both are out touting the benefits of the transaction, GLPI is receiving $110MM annually in rent for their $1.21B investment for a 9.1% cap rate or 11x EV/EBITDA, and Eldorado is quoting a 6.6x pre-synergies (BYD is paying 6.25x for certain PNK/PENN casinos) and 5.0x post-synergies multiple on the operations that includes some net cash and cash build until close.\u00a0 At 9.75x 2017 EBITDA of $190MM, Tropicana received a great deal (TPCA was trading at 4-4.5x EBITDA in 2013) that really touts the benefits of utilizing the REIT structure and its lower cost of capital to consolidate the industry.\u00a0 But as someone invested in the gaming sector, is Icahn marking the top here?\u00a0 He timed the cycle well pre-financial crisis, let's hope his timing isn't quite as perfect this time around and he has other motivations as it appears he's piling up cash throughout IEP.

His kit focuses on multiple CCs, health regen, and bit of tankiness. He isn't tanky but what he lacks in armor he makes up for in kill pressure and damage. Not to take anything away from Cleanse, but Ahrmio isn't a necessity to have as cleanse is a strong non-tp in the meta (instead of ulting a group of enemy heroes you'll either CC them or burst them down with your three hits of Ahrmio's spirit rune). **Other options**: Any support you wanna try out.

Introduction - Behemoth Playstyle Playstyle of an Elementalist. Fast - very predictable and similar. High mobility - But can be countered with all types of mobility. Shouting \u2013 This guy is quite loud in and out of the game. He will shout something like \"at least I beat you not late\" or \"I have your head right here\" as he has a hard counter \"intimidation shield\" which also is a short range magic shield. His counter is also hitting him while he is not within max range. His main source of damage is a damaging area of effect cleave. Countering him takes a while because he can just evade and not stand a chance until his cleave is off cooldown. Last shout - This guy will yell once every other cast of spells, usually about 6 seconds. This is his main counter as you can just dodge and go about your business. Countering him is pretty easy, you just have to be patient and wait the 6 seconds. Referee - Last shout/disputation will occur whenever he is at least within max range from you. You can take out 1-2 of his minions, and stop the game if you don't win the first 1-2 spells. **Runes**:** ~ [Bonus: +15% damage against monsters, adds a small amount of global defense] ~ [Bonus: +60% splash damage against monsters, adds a small amount of global defense/aoe] ~ [Bonus: +25% damage against monsters, adds a small amount of global defense/aoe] / [Bonus: +35% splash damage against monsters, adds a small amount of global defense/aoe] / [Passive: 20% of all damage dealt to monsters now scales in a fixed percentage of damage dealt to you and is added to the total] / [Passive: 15% of all damage dealt to monsters now scales in a fixed percentage of damage dealt to you and is added to the total] / [Passive: +20% area damage] ~ [Passive: +25% area damage] / [Passive: +30% area damage] / [Passive: +35% area damage] / [Passive: +40% damage against monsters] **Build**: > [40 points in Talent Tree] > [35 points in the passive tree] > [30 points in the skill tree] > [15 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the skill tree] > [35 points in the skill tree] > [25 points in the skill tree] > [45 points in the skill tree] > [30 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the passive tree] > [33 points in the passive tree] > [15 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the passive tree] > [30 points in the passive tree] > [25 points in the passive tree] > [45 points in the skill tree] > [25 points in the passive tree] > [45 points in the skill tree] > [15 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the passive tree] > [33 points in the passive tree] > [15 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the passive tree] > [33 points in the passive tree] > [15 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the passive tree] > [33 points in the passive tree] > [15 points in the passive tree] > [20 points in the passive tree] > [33 points in the passive tree] > [14 points in the skill tree] > [18 points in the passive tree] > [31 points in the skill tree] > [", "topp": "**Champion:** Ahrmio, The Herald of the Mist **Price**: 1 IP / 999999999 RP **Primary role**: Mage **Secondary role**: Offlaner **Skill mastery:** **Ahrmio's spirit rune** **Why ye green?** In place of a Red rune, Ahrmio's spirit rune has a blue rune in the champion select screen. This blue rune allows Ahrmio to cast his champion spells in a pillar of light. To illustrate this, instead of entering a champion select screen, you take in a peek at the pillar of light. Read on for more info about Ahrmio's spirit rune, and his roles in the meta. Ahrmio makes a group with Sera by the river by running past them and around one tower. He buys a Nexus and begins upgrading his vision on the map. Ahrmio assumes a neutral strategy and tries to clean up the enemy team. He discovers that Nautilus and Kled are present on the map at the same time and he and LeBlanc will trade up. Finally, Ahrmio gains his ultimate, Lux. Lux is a more powerful version of Ahrmio's Spirit Rune which gives Ahrmio just a bit more for his gold, while this Spirit Rune gives him 100% vision of the Rift. Ahrmio gains his lead. Their bot lane is flanked. LeBlanc pulls into the river to start her Arbalest combo. Kled begins to creep his jungle and find the chances of a delay or a gank come from that direction. In exchange, LeBlanc is going to stun and then execute him. He gets stunned but LeBlanc catches and transitions into playing the fast and free magic dealer. Ahrmio turns towards the gank route because this tower is the biggest and by the time it falls he will have gotten five free kills to help snowball and win the game. Then he realizes that Lux is not only higher level than him, but also stronger and can actually kill him. Ahrmio wants to dodge Lux, but Celeste has also played no comp's. She can keep playing and pick off one of her targets and Ahrmio's pressure from this lane is decreased. Ahrmio is now heavily focused. Exasperated, LeBlanc has a choice. Since she has refused to throw her Axe onto Lux to open a gank, she can and do gank Lux by running out and last hitting whenever Lux has been aggressively poked out of lane. Lux's jungler and friend are about to gank here, so Ziggs can come in and murder lux. Ahrmio screams that to die to Lux is suicide, but he has no chance to stop Lux's team from pulling off the gank. He can only play part of the game then. It is done though, and Lux moves on to the next one. She ganks and kills Ahrmio because she is saved by the fact that only Shen is near to engage and since she is 100% now with Ahrmio, she knows his weakness to Ashe's headbutt. Ahrmio follows up by killing everyone except Shen and ignores Shen for the day. Even though every champion can do a little harass to Ahrmio or Lux, it is too much for Ahrmio to risk. He comes to a standstill and Lux attacks. Oh Shelyn, you are amazing, slaughter us! Ahrmio is willing to give up his farm, but Lux is still in pursuit and it is to his advantage. Ahrmio is working for her whole game, not just one component. LeBlanc is at a sacrifice time. Her Zyra long-range stun and Nami's long-range CC poke Ahrmio off of his harass. LeBlanc realizes that she cannot fully fight with Ahrmio because of Lux's overwhelming advantage at this point, so she quickly decides to split off and try to harass Ahrmio with her teammates. Ahrmio is at a disadvantage but a crumb of his team is on the other team and she is forcing him to stay in lane and farm. He does not even have the edge to \"land\" a gank now, and to give himself a few more kills. Ahrmio already has so many weaknesses because of the coordination from LeBlanc and her team and being caught out of position is all he can do. Lux's ultimate lands, causing all the less skilled LeBlanc members to draw a great deal of Sona's supports, giving Ahrmio full control of him. Lux has no intention of making space and Ahrmio is now required to pressure Lux and LeBlanc. Ahrmio leaves to fight back in mid lane, but soon heals up enough to quickly extend the fight to the tower. Ahrmio then moves back to sidelane where he can farm with Lux and play this both a team lane and a solo queue laning phase. Ahrmio gets ahead because of his raw power to deal damage as well", "human": "**Champion:** Ahrmio, The Herald of the Mist **Price**: 1 IP / 999999999 RP **Primary role**: Mage **Secondary role**: Tank **Secondary bar**: Mana _**STATISTICS**_ **HEALTH** 603 \u2013 2061 **HEALTH REGEN.** 8.1 \u2013 18.2 **MANA** 279 (+36) **MANA REGEN.** 6.3 (+0.6) **RANGED** 545 **ATTACK DAMAGE** 56 \u2013 108 **ATTACK SPEED** 0.612 (+0% \u2013 34%) **ARMOR** 22.5 \u2013 81.9 **MAGIC RES.** 32.4 \u2013 52.2 **MOV.

His whole body is almost completely hidden by a long dark rumpled cloak, full of holes and partially ripped. A hood covers his head, eyes and nose. Two big holes nearby the eyes allow him to see; also, the hood is adorned with purple arched curves. His cracked lips are the only thing visible under his hood. The right part of Ahrmio's body is consumed by the Black Mist. His clothes are partially burned, his right eye is green and blue, the left one is green. Mostly from the right of his mouth, whenever he speaks, cerulean flames erupt like there's a blaze inside Ahrmio's body. Both his gaunt arms are wrapped in a consumed bandage. The left arm is usually hidden under his cloak; the right one is raised to the shoulder's height. Almost invisible threads, strictly entangled to Ahrmio's right arm, come out from under the cloak and run to the open palm of the hand, turned upwards. These threads, intertwined with Ahrmio's fingers, go up to the sky. The threads fall down onto Bryn Dane, Ahrmio's marionette. A red line cuts Bryn Dane's body in two separate halves. The one on the right has female treats: a smaller arm, the carved eyes have longer eyelashes, a breast on the chest is hidden by a white patched dress, secured with a thick rugged nail. The left part of Bryn Dane has masculine features carved on the face and the body, then pieces of canvas secured with the same nails cover the leg. _*NOTE: feel free to come up with your own fan arts, we'll add it in!

Dark Candles have 1 health and take 1 damage each time an enemy champion attacks them. If an enemy champion destroys a Dark Candle, they earn 10 gold. Dark Candles generate Black Mist, which spreads on the surroundings area at a rate of 50 units per second, up to a maximum diameter of 650/700/750/800/850/900 units . No one can see inside the mist from the outside and vice versa. A ward placed inside the black mist works normally and reveal a portion of the area.

Apparently no student dared join the rehearsals, or they could have been in for a lot of bad smack talk.\n\nOn the other hand, despite how seriously it could be taken, it has been fairly quite readable. The \"dramatic injustice\" of the former political system went far beyond simply not being adapted to the new millennium. Nobody disputes the fact that Al Capone, Fredo Lee, and several dozen other gang leaders, and numerous clerks, drivers, mollicians, and bank clerks plus numerous heads of agencies and secretaries and mail clerks could not be bothered to write a checks to the government. Unlike individual colonists, they were required to divide a payment to various government agencies. There is no way any of the 1830's Africans could in good conscience make legal purchases with paper that was not socially accepted. When they succeeded in buying a drink in the store, they had to shred the paper to fit their expensive 8-ounce glass. They had to pay any tax, and they had to go out for dinner when they were not paid enough.\n\nIn Europe, not so much. If we take the commandant in Venetia prison, under poor Caligula, for example, he could have written off the fund obligation on a paper that was legal, costly to produce, easy to work with, and was accepted by the system. He had to say a New Year's day payment and stop. His lack of tax avoidance did have an effect. Let's have a look at the facts:\n\nIn the shop:\n\nIf there were money around, any merchant could make himself a loan on contract, that was the case with the buy, or take, or sell of lands.\n\nIf there were not money around, we had buyers, sellers, and sellers, keeping track of the goods. I had to return the money I had loaned that day if it had not been back the day the day of my own creation and that day was going to be paid as part of the the core payments. If the final payment was not reflected that day, the beneficiary would be notified by the paper. The banks were concerned with only those payments that were paid within 24 hours.\n\nNow imagine that we have standing armies in the streets to safeguard the property of the universe, and they see that they are routinely not paid before those 24 hours has passed. Some of them decide to sell their property for storage. An armored truck breaks down at noon. The owner may pick it up later, but if not, any surviving owners won't give the owners permission, and he would be liable for paying twice.\n\nSuppose there is a workaround. That's what it was with total railroads. The railroad company has little political clout here, and its bank essentially buys its stock. So the railroad ends up in collusion with the bank, which acts as a tiny loan shark that takes the railroad bankrupt, stuffs it into the crates, and swindles the dying out of the settlement money before it can be paid out.\n\nNow suppose the government, which owns the banks, wanted to see what the banks were doing. The government said: We require us to trade against this deal unless you must pay out actual money. Again, the banks respond with an \"irrational gamble\" because the initial payoff amount was unknown, and it was not clear that the banks would have a settlement by the time they got paid. The banks are always going to lose money, and if they are going to make a profit, they'll just convert their collateral, much in the same way that these mechanisms were used to convert Roman revenue bonds into gold bullion.

Once you see a body you don't leave it,' he told the Chronicle\n\nHenri, now a 23-year-old teenager, has not been in Newcastle since July last year. The strange sensation started when he moved in with his girlfriend on the summer break and couldn't sleep but found the couple's flat in Chubton a bit weird.\n\nHe bought a cheap camera and decided to capture the moments of rest for himself.\n\nHe saw the doorknob turn in the privacy of their bedroom and came in not knowing it was the victim of a crime.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nHenri says he spent three or four hours at the scene, calling 999 and taking pictures of the debris and the blood, before he flew to Rio de Janeiro and began 'fighting for his life' when he tried to escape.\n\nSoon Henri knew it was his mother's body. Henri took no pictures of the victim but grabbed his cologne bottle and left.\n\nJust a month later Henri, who said he had dreamed of finding the body in a sea of broken glass for years, returned to the scene to photograph the scene of the crime.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n'I used to climb trees when I was a kid in France,' he said. 'I would stand on one and slowly approach the other side and have pictures taken. When I went back I saw the skull.'\n\nHe pulled the picture out and placed it in the back of his car, just as he did when he first got into Newcastle and imagined what he would find.\n\nA few weeks later Henri returned to Chubton and spotted the tell-tale machete protruding from the yard where the bones were resting.\n\n'Everyone was walking around but he is the only ones who have come back,' Henri's mother Sally said.\n\n'He has lost his childhood. He is well adjusted and he loves England. He wants to play football one day.\n\nHenri may have wanted to live a normal life. At 5ft 9ins he is a big lad but is perfectly happy when there are no cameras around.\n\n'He is a mild-mannered man,\" Sally said. 'I remember thinking he wouldn't hurt anyone. He keeps his shirt on in the car.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nThe Chubton area was hit by one of Newcastle upon Tyne's busiest winters during the war, with blizzards bringing record numbers to the city.\n\nIn the 18 months Henri was there he visited every home except for his mother's.\n\nThe serial killer was first identified after Henri's stepfather received a phone call saying he was wanted for a burglary.\n\nLater police got a tip from a woman that the exact place was outside Newcastle East Hospital. Henri showed them the evidence of the crime.\n\nHe paid him \u00a38 for help with the evidence against him, which proved sufficient to convict Henri of the crime.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nAfter his trial Henri was placed inside segregation and served a three-and-a-half month sentence at Newcastle Prison with full credit for his time.\n\nSince then Henri had his passport cancelled by prison officials and his sentence changed so that he now has to serve the remainder of his sentence from the outside.\n\n'The friends who came by to cheer me up were concerned about me.

To be taken out of that place like that was traumatic.\n\n\"I still don't know my mum, all I know is I was in the hospital and gone. If I didn't know you were coming back for a short while I would have just wanted to go home.\"\n\nAbhishek Singh has been signed by West Ham while Paul Gascoigne is one of a number of-come Manchester United stars to be rumoured with the club.\n\nHe said of his footballing stay in Newcastle United: \"I've had the emotional roller coaster, to be honest.\n\n\"To leave a club like Newcastle, where I was raised, the atmosphere is so hard to get into.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to new days and hopefully I'll start to get back into my own season.\n\n\"It would have been nice to get back into the dressing room a bit and people saw who I really was.

At all.\"\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nHowever, despite talk of him being sold by Newcastle in the summer, Saivet maintains he wants his move to St James' Park to be a success.\n\nIn his first big interview since returning to the club, Saivet told the Chronicle: \"I want to play for Newcastle United.\n\n\"Whenever you pull on a Newcastle shirt it's an honour. It's a massive club and when you put the jersey on and get on to the pitch, you have to give 100% - even for the reserves. You want to play well every time.\"\n\nSaivet, who appeared briefly for the club in pre-season, was back on the field at St James' Park on Monday night in front of just 721 people but he enjoyed every second of a solid 90 minute run out in which fans were reminded of his midfield capabilities.\n\nHe said: \"It's always good to play, make runs and contribute overall. I feel better and better so it was really good for me to get out there.\"\n\nUnlike some players at the club Rafa Benitez has never had an issue with Saivet's attitude or ability \u2013 he simply prefers other squad members ahead of him.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nBut Saivet found himself named in Newcastle's 25-man squad this month and is now ready to catch the eye of Benitez.\n\nHe said: \"I have to show him I can play in his team. I have to play very well in each training session or reserve game.\n\n\"He has told me to show what I can do and we need everybody in the squad so I will keep going.\n\n\"Maybe one day I will get my chance and show what I can do. I know there will be a chance.\n\n\"In football you know you can start a season in the stand or on the bench, but finish it in the team.\n\n\"You just never know but I am ready to play at any time. I have to stay fit. I will play for the reserves.\n\n\"The season is long and it is about improving as you go along so that's what I'll do.\"\n\nSaivet's return to Newcastle last summer resulted in some Toon fans singing the praises of the former Bordeaux star.\n\nAfter some positive cameos, Saivet was the recipient of some goodwill messages from supporters.\n\nHe said: \"It always gives you the confidence you need. That is the most important thing in football. If you have confidence you can do whatever you want on the pitch. You have to work and keep going.\n\n\"You should never complain about not playing - the most important thing is the squad. We have to win and stay in the Premier League as we've just come back.\n\n\"It won't be easy so individuals can't complain about personal situations. It's always easier of course when you are fit and can play. You run everywhere and try to do everything.\n\n\"Not playing isn't easy for a footballer. You have to work hard to get back in contention.\n\n\"If get my chance I will have to keep my place. I will try my best every time.\"\n\nNewcastle go into the weekend's clash with Liverpool hoping for another win to help them climb the table.\n\nSaivet - who once netted against the Reds for Bordeaux in the Europa League and would love another crack at them - said: \"The spirit is very, very good.\n\n\"We have to work hard and nobody should complain. Everybody is trying to do their best. The team is going to get better and better and that's the most important thing for us.\"\n\nAnd Saivet made it clear he was happy on Tyneside and enjoying life at the club.\n\nHe said: \"It's a massive club", "eta_suffix": " time.\n\nSince then Henri had his passport cancelled by prison officials and his sentence changed so that he now has to serve the remainder of his sentence from the outside.\n\n'The friends who came by to cheer me up were concerned about me.

However, when knocked out and they only take on 10 damage they don't take off much off the survivability, meaning the damage is partially wasted on a low damage enemy.\n\nIn general, you will want to start with 2 belt buckles, 1 belt.2 strap, 1 flail (if you don't plan to run into baddies later, then 2 Flails are faster and you don't have a requirement for a second belt buckle) and 1 sword.\n\nYou could try to get different equipment just for higher level characters, such as:\n\n\n3 bags of scrolls, 2 bags of potions, 1 plate armor, 2 daggers, 1 leather armor, 1 alcaes if you have extra money for it\n\n1 sword of the same dps as the dagger, 1 helmet of the same dps as the helmet, 1 elven circlet\n\n1 flail, 1 leather belt, 1 metal belt\n\n1 leather dress, 1 elven circlet\n\n1 elven bandana, 1 elven gown, 1 elven gloves\n\n1 elven ring, 1 elven amulet, 1 elven ring (less needs to be added to add +20 health), 1 elven staff\n\n1 elvish dress, 1 elvish tunic, 1 elvish cloak\n\n1 elvish boots, 1 elvish boots, 2 light shoes, 2 pairs of gloves, 1 leather armor\n\n1 cloth cloak\n\n1 magic ring, 1 elvish circlet, 1 elvish ring, 1 elvish amulet, 1 elvish ring\n\n1 elvish robes, 1 elvish vestment, 1 elvish gloves, 1 elvish boots, 2 leather shoes\n\n1 bandanna, 1 bandit 1 smithing kit, 2 pouch\n\n1 leather boot, 1 leather belt, 1 leather gloves\n\n1 leather rings\n\n1 elvish gown\n\n1 elvish gown with ring (if you have the chance, buy a large elvish gown for the low perece value of the ring), 1 elvish skirt, 1 elvish bandana\n\n1 elvish shoes, 2 boots, 2 gloves\n\n1 elvish bandana\n\n6 potions, 10 ammunition, 60 silver, 6 leather, 2 gp, 1 food\n\nSkills\n\nStarting skills are for people not planning to run into evil DMs. I want to say 15 points of crafting, 1 point of arms, 1 point of stone-forging are for party members, but in reality you could add other skills, at your leisure:\n\nFeats are self-explanatory.\n\nSneak attack is very useful against large groups of undead.

{"eta": "Christian evangelist and self-styled historian David Barton, center, with hat, at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images for the David Barton History Institute)\n\nBarton has struggled to shed his reputation as a Religious Right flim-flam man. His 2006 biography, the American Jesus: Was Jesus a Conservative? \"Haunted by allegations of radical beliefs,\" it offered (and continues) many of the hard-line strains of the evangelical right, and that became his hallmark work.\n\nBarton's books on Jesus, however, aren't widely available in Christian education. So we examined the work of Barton's two closest competitors, James White and Jerry Falwell. The Barton-White controversy gave us an angle into Barton's worldview; we could also see something of what Falwell teaches at Liberty University.\n\nWhite is a preeminent evangelical megachurch pastor, bestselling author and leader at Liberty University, the largest school in the United States when it launched in 1982. Among other things, White helped bring the largest megachurch campus in the United States to focus on serving young people. White is also an elder of the East Tennessee Baptist Church.\n\nWhite and Falwell are friendly, even if many of the ideas contained in their works fall squarely in line with those of Falwell (more liberal politics and more fundamentalist Christianity, for instance). There is a noticeable overlap in viewpoints on topics like marijuana, abortion, homosexuality and the \"war on Christianity\" in the works of both men and the Barton-White camp.\n\nOur approach was neither liberal nor conservative by any means, nor was it meant to be. It reflects a public interest journalism approach to a conservative movement that has been extremely difficult to write about in these troubled times. Our aim, however, was to come at the subject from different angles.\n\nIn a now-famous interview, Falwell went on a personal and violent tirade against the Catholic Church in the 1980s (the archbishop of New York at the time was John O'Connor). And in 2004, he claimed the 9/11 attacks were God's punishment against America for his repeated insistence that God had the solution to America's problem with gun violence. The question then was, how should Christians cope with the end of religion?\n\nWe decided to look at the key historical figures who helped produce both of those poles of modern Christianity, and that meant that we thought of Falwell as more than just a white nationalist who floated the idea that the Catholic church was unelected and untrustworthy, and White as a moderate conservative who co-opted the message of religion from the American Civil War to push it back and embrace a society built around the prosperity gospel.\n\n\"The Final Battle\"\n\nEven as we studied the church, evangelicalism and Jesus, we quickly shifted our perspective and decided to take a look at the history of Christianity in England and beyond. The rise of Christianity in England has been one of the greatest revolutions in history. That will not come as a surprise to many, given that it is the country whose words shaped the words and deeds of the Founding Fathers, including George Washington.\n\nFrom the beginning of England's history, Christianity was marked by the spread of Protestantism, with its focus on the Puritan and the great works of the medieval era.\n\nWhat we learned from White and Falwell is that though they embrace the merger of Christianity into a new ideology (aka \"the American religion\"), the similarities do not end there.\n\nWhite writes: \"The American nation does not even begin to cover the enormity, any more than the British Royal Family does, of Christianity's import to the United States, to the one million members of the Christian denominations in this country and the six million across the world. In its invasion and conquest, in its policy and activism, American Christianity has influenced the course of our nation much as Anglo-Saxon Christianity had the days before it.\"\n\n'We Are the Leader of the World'\n\nThe text in question is the Declaration of Independence, signed by the United States' delegates to the British North America Congress in Boston July 4, 1776. It was the first document from the nation to explicitly declare America as a Christian nation. And, of course, it was the document that gave birth to Christianity.\n\nBut what White and Falwell don't say is that the Founding Fathers realized this independence of faith was problematic as well, and that they sought to work through these secular concerns so as to create a Christian nation.\n\nThe Anti-Federalist Papers, written by John Jay, the only federalist senator who opposed the Constitution, suggest one of those secular concerns: \"There was, indeed, a tendency among the great representatives of the people, at that very period to palliate religion and to obscure the principles on which it was founded.\"\n\nAnd so, not only did it become \"the most important department of administration,\" as Washington put it", "topp": "Christian evangelist and self-styled historian David Barton, center, with hat, at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images for the David Barton History Institute)\n\nBarton has struggled to shed his reputation as a Religious Right flim-flam man. His foot soldiers, the American Family Association and Concerned Women for America, have been thoroughly discredited and do not meet the standards needed to be considered acceptable within the Republican Party.\n\nYet Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor, believes the conspiracy-mongering former Oklahoma congressman will be successful in twisting the polls and overriding political will to protect an opponent.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he'll win,\" Kristol says. \"He has this background with conspiracy theories that Republicans can talk about their values and get votes from conservatives. The bottom line is just easy enough to grasp. It's very difficult for many people to understand how stuff like this isn't just normal, but rather obvious.\"\n\nThe threat of Romney gaining 50% of the vote in the state is a concern for Kristol, as the \"Billionaire Republican\" is already the declared front-runner for the nomination. Santorum is considered by some and the media to have hurt his chances with voters by running as a moderate.\n\n\"The person who wins is the person who has a lot of money,\" says William Kristol, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who served as a Bush administration aide to three presidents (he's recanted that claim in light of Santorum's and Gingrich's insurgent campaigns). \"Romney's money is definitely used as an asset by his team and the Santorum people. \"You can look at how public conservative groups are spending, how much money we're spending on social conservative bills, these are just the start. I don't understand why we're fighting so hard against Gov. Romney in this state and for Newt Gingrich, who is basically an aristocrat in this contest.\"\n\nHoward Dean is perhaps the Republican establishment's most obvious political threat. A Vermont native who ran for president in 2004 and 2008 as a Democrat, the governor brought an unconventional, bombastic style to campaigning. His repeated insistence that the Iraq war is a fraud would have likely brought down the government had it not been thwarted by a ground force made up of American soldiers. The result of his candidacy was the resignation of the president, which upset the Democrats' conventional wisdom about Democrats being on the right side of history.\n\nMore than two years after that election, the tireless governor, an avowed feminist and candidate for a Senate seat from Vermont, is seeking a second term. Although his rise has yet to reach full steam, it is a mark of a society fundamentally changing.\n\nKristol's political activist neighbor, James Dobson, a former Baptist minister who founded Focus on the Family, says he will not let the foundation's fortunes be dictated by his disagreements with Kristol.\n\nDobson touts his site's reputation as a staunch conservative outreach organization and a tool for obtaining access to big-name elected officials, including presidential hopefuls like Romney and Santorum. \"It's the tireless fact-checking of media statements,\" Dobson says of Americans for Prosperity. \"We provide the data. People want to look at that data. But the majority of people\u2014especially in the media\u2014just automatically use what they're told. Americans have no idea what they're asking when they talk to a politician. We are that information.\"\n\nUpton Sinclair developed his comedy-mongering tactics from an early day in the 1930s in Lancaster, Pa., with the 1933 publication of What's Happening. The book went on to sell nearly a million copies, despite being lambasted for denying the Holocaust.\n\nDobson, meanwhile, channels the Republican establishment's agenda. He's in essence running a political operation of his own: Citizens United, now interrupted by his Prosperity Summit, is his own tax-exempt, not-for-profit umbrella group. As one of its top funders in 2012, the group gave millions to Missouri-based Americans for Prosperity, which has spent millions in campaigns to combat President Obama's policies.\n\nMuch of the Pew Center's polling is taken from anonymous responses rather than live interviews, which could create the possibility of both incomplete and biased readings. But that does not mean the polling data is worthless. Democrats have been diligent in taking note of Santorum's video links and his non-existent Medicaid expansion plans.\n\n\"They are so game for a very effective opportunist like Santorum who walks into a crowded room,\" says Mike Murphy, Romney's senior campaign adviser. \"The coalition that holds the NRA back now is this divide-and-conquer mentality. By reinforcing this notion that there are really two choices, you can change attitudes. If you can evoke a sense of frustration by using Reagan's positions, that'll energize this young voter.\"\n\nIf he can swing voters on immigration, Santorum could", "human": "Christian evangelist and self-styled historian David Barton, center, with hat, at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nLast Saturday night in northeastern Iowa, moments before Glenn Beck delivered a 56-minute speech in which he eventually got around to endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz for president, a willowy man with powder puff white hair strolled to the lectern and said a few words.\n\nNot once did the man \u2014 who spoke of Beck as \"a visionary\" and who laid his hands on Beck in prayer beforehand \u2014 mention Cruz's name.\n\nDavid Barton also never told the crowd inside the Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center his name, even though he introduced other speakers and served as the event's de facto master of ceremonies.\n\nBarton's anonymity was fitting. It was something of a metaphor for the relationship between Cruz and Barton, both of whom hail from Texas. Cruz has maintained a delicate balance in his association with Barton, a figure who is a hero to some evangelical Christians, and a fraud to others.\n\nFew figures represent the split running down the middle of American evangelicalism better than Barton, a 62-year-old self-taught historian (critics call him a pseudo-historian) who has for more than two decades stumped across the country telling conservative Christians that their nation's religious heritage has been covered up and stolen from them by godless secular progressives.\n\nMany in the crowd doubtless knew who Barton was even without an introduction. He is something of a celebrity to those who have viewed his videos at church events or online, or who saw him on Fox News when he regularly appeared on Beck's show. But Barton's reputation has taken some big hits in the last few years, and the integrity of his articles, videos and books has been widely called into question, most aggressively by some conservative evangelical scholars and writers. One history professor at a Christian university said Barton was the conservative version of left-wing academic Howard Zinn.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is joined on stage by conservative commentator Glenn Beck at Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center in Waterloo, Iowa, January 23, 2016. (Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\n\"Neither of them are historians. They just want to use and manipulate the past to serve their own political or ideological agendas in the present,\" wrote John Fea, chair of the history department at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pa.\n\nYet Barton is helpful to Cruz because the presidential candidate has built his strategy for winning the Republican nomination around winning in Iowa, the first state to vote in the primary process, and a place where 60 percent of the GOP electorate identifies as evangelical. Too close an association with Barton, however, would open Cruz up to questions about the influence on his thinking of a man whose views about faith and politics can often sound like Christian reconstructionism \u2014 the belief that government laws and policies should be drawn explicitly from the Bible.\n\nSlideshow: On the trail and down to the wire in Iowa >>>\n\nBarton argued in 2011 that the progressive income tax, capital gains tax and the estate tax (or death tax), are all contrary to the Bible. \"Jesus has two entire teachings on the capital gains tax,\" Barton claimed, citing Luke 19:13-26 and Matthew 25:14-29. And, he added, \"Jesus did not like the minimum wage.\"\n\nThe Bible does not address any of these issues explicitly. Barton was taking parables told by Jesus in the New Testament and interpreting them quite liberally. Barton said in an interview that his critics often misinterpret or exaggerate his many claims. \"I like the Constitution we've got. I'm not trying to replace it with the Bible,\" he said. When asked about his comments about Jesus' views on tax policy, Barton deflected the question. \"What I often say in reporting history doesn't mean that's what I'm advocating for policy right now,\" he said.\n\nBarton may say statements about Jesus' view of taxes aren't prescriptive, but for Christians who believe the Bible should govern all aspects of their lives, Barton's comments provide a theological justification for ignoring their tax bill that takes higher precedence than the law. If the word of God is explicitly opposed to what the Internal Revenue Service is doing, such a believer might reason with himself, then he or she is in fact bound to oppose and defy the IRS.\n\nThese are not the types of statements the Cruz campaign wants their candidate being questioned about on the campaign trail. In September Barton was named as the leader of a pro-Cruz super-PAC, Keep the Promise, making him an official supporter of Cruz's but without any official connection to Cruz's campaign. Of course, if Cruz world was uncomfortable with Barton's endorsement, they wouldn't have wanted him involved with the super-PAC at all.\n\nOne of Barton's most noticeable projects so far in the campaign was to gather roughly 300 pastors and \"faith", "eta_suffix": " senator who opposed the Constitution, suggest one of those secular concerns: \"There was, indeed, a tendency among the great representatives of the people, at that very period to palliate religion and to obscure the principles on which it was founded.\"\n\nAnd so, not only did it become \"the most important department of administration,\" as Washington put it", "topp_suffix": ". \"The coalition that holds the NRA back now is this divide-and-conquer mentality.

Puroresu of Glass Volume 1 is out now. You can get it here. Of course, you should read up on all the excellent stuff that's been said in comments, but I've got a quote in mind for you:- Shinji looks an awful lot like Misato, plus ED1 has 4/5 season episodes where it seems he came out of nowhere - IMO - it was canon that she and the others knew their names were somehow connected in the past, and then the last scene is a flashback to their past history. Puroresu of Glass is also having lots of amazing advertisements-All is well in the world- Hyuga and Keelie being friends even by their jobs- Historical settings being realistic though then modified by, say, a certain Pinkerton detective - Their \"Being\" connotation is something I noticed before. But in this case, their knowledge wasn't useful. They just heard about other people's \"being\", and got into different things because of that.- Keelie sounds possibly the most sincere of the main four, with a newfound- Zen doesn't define anything, he just shows us the way we do things- Hazama is a \"making(s)\" and game developer- Rainer's \"I just want to fix things\" is an arrogant jerk- Shinji was more Dr. Jekyll than Doc Hyde, as in all he does is help other people do things he thinks are \"selfish\" with the aid of unnamed \"agents\" in secret. Ergo, running into \"cause and effect\" was central to the series. (But such connections were only vaguely detailed.) So, in hindsight, Keelie/Zen's being \"one with their life\" was an oxymoron, from the angel's viewpoint, and the effects only seemed relevant and understandable in that context. But in contemporary times, \"personality\" and \"own life\" mostly don't have any real significance outside of the context of a genre. In all the faux-\"messages\" Puroresu has written in the context of its own goddamn, holy fantasy, \"being\" was never on anyone's agenda other than itself.- The white scene in episode 13 is nothing but a silly throwaway and should be made into a favorite flavor of every anime with supermen, loli, and Mr. X jokes...not Shinji- and it shouldn't have even been in the first episode of the damn story. I don't care about what happened that happened, he had plenty of time to log out in episode 14 (change Shinji's place of residence and price, that was easy) and keep plugging away like a bloodthirsty maniac. But I'm certain the White Episode was a cheap amount of exposition to unsettle the audience, which was so clearly written. I understand that this was meant to create their symbolic connection with Uranus, but even then I'm not sure what by that \"symbolic connection\" was meant to mean. It all seems completely surreal, and it just felt superimposed on the suitably dreamlike backdrop of the illogical sequence.Also, sorry, I threw up there a little: \"Such toil brought the worlds together as a multitude of souls used technology to transcend unimaginable physical limits...until eventually the scale of their creation made the world too fragile for their designs. Rather than cease self-evolution, the proportions began to revert, as something far too grand had become possible. Worse, the multiverse was so warped that the conditions of reality themselves began to collapse...a universe so vast that it made the multiverse seem insignificant. More like reality itself was an unreal number.\" It also makes me want to stop watching Puroresu before it kills me. (or at least burn its ass.) Anyway, thus, episode 13. As you know, this point in the plot is irrelevant. In fact, for reasons vaguely related to the NERV file in dialogue there, Shinji may have himself been originally seen here.At first I thought it was an imaginary narrative, possibly Japanese sci-fi:And then I remembered the parallel who:I also remembered it was a plot hole in Puroresu.And then I noticed it contradicted the entire premise of the series...from episode 1 onward... If this is really the other major plot hole, the NERV file, then there's only one way this can be resolved: Shinji must defeat the enemy from planet 1, and his intent must come true. As in, kill the enemy- Yup, that's it, that's all there is to the whole series.

{"eta": "CHAPTER 12\n\nJohn 12:1-11. THE ANOINTING AT BETHANY.\n\n1-8. six days before the passover--that is, during Passover, because they were appointed to celebrate the passover seven days (Num 26:36). In the gospel they do so under the authority of Moses (cf. Acts 9:25), who was appointed and set over them, and under a solemn council of the elders, or high priests, not above the priests but with God at their head (cf. Acts 17:7, 20), and who alone are to take part in the Passover meal (cf. Acts 16:1-15), \"compassing with himself the people together\" (Pro 19:6). The older part of the account may be taken as showing that the Sabbath or festive season was about to begin. Some of the congregation at Nazareth received permission from the rabbis to celebrate the sabbath (Heb 4:13; Jer 44:4; 33:1; Zech 14:8). By the law, which also gave by divine right the duty of a priest to celebrate the sabbath, it was forbidden to celebrate it on Saturday (Lev 27:1-8), even though the Sabbath was not to begin until midnight (Jer 43:18).\n\n\n2. during the half of the year when all the full moons of the moon fall on that portion of the land on which the earth is divided,\n\nthe days beginning at midnight and extending throughout the day--this is not to be understood in any way of a special [whole] night. From the season of the full moon, the whole of the passover, in Jerusalem, is seen, including that part of the month over which the supreme authority was placed.\n\n\n3. But the evening,\n\nthe first night,\n\nafter the sixth hour of the night as nearly as may be, (1) before\n\nthe first stars of the sky, which come in the sixth year,\n\n(2) during the first two weeks of the days before the Passover--This third part means,\n\nthe time assigned for each of the two intermediate days in the Lord's week, as described in Galatians 4:1-2;\n\nthe whole of\n\nthe Festival of Unleavened Bread,\n\nbeing fulfilled at the hour of the festival of Unleavened Bread\n\n(3)\n\nthe first three days after the Passover. From the fourth part is derived the date of the festival\n\n(4)\n\nthe whole of the feasts of the Hebrews at which the Jews performed their sacrifices:\n\n1. the great feasts or Passover of the Jewish priests, the day during which Christ was crucified and rose from the dead (Ro 12:16),\n\n2. the feast of the tabernacle and tabernacles to which the priests were drawn (Ro 13:29),\n\n3. the feast in which he ascended into heaven (Ro 14:17-26),\n\n4. the festival of the saints, a day which so coincidental it sometimes happened to fall during the seven-day period in which the days preceding the Passover were named (Ro 14:30). Among the descriptions given by Christ of the Sabbath sabbath, this in our Lord's case (Matt 12:16; Matt 19:13) is mentioned in the best light as the day of the harvest celebration (called the festival of unleavened bread), which, beginning with the sixth day after the passover, covers the whole earth and its full moon in which there had been no fruits, no flowers, on which nothing could be done in the month of November while the latter remained in full moon. (See the other references.) This was also the day on which Christ came into \"the world\" and \"the flesh,\" while this also corresponds to the complete 24 hours, and therefore the time allowed for an Israelite's remaining in the land, or of our present dispensation in our human history. This feast had indeed a special significance for Israel, since Jerusalem had, until a few generations ago, been built on the former site of the Temple, where, as often happened on such occasions, a connection might sometimes have been worked out between the idolatrous worship which took place between the houses of God and that of the kingdoms of the east and of the west. From the description we have it was later that the Temple was taken down by the Romans, together with the cult of the Persian God Mithra, of the Jewish religion, which there was in the Temple as well as in the Jewish Sabbath (Temple Mount). These texts of Christ's day appear, therefore, almost as early as the Summa Theologica in the Egyptian Coptic and Coptic versions:\n\nVIII., 1, p. 10: \"Verily the day that thy Lord ate there was the Sabbath of", "topp": "CHAPTER 12\n\nJohn 12:1-11. THE ANOINTING AT BETHANY.\n\n1-8. six days before the passover--that is, during Passover, because they were appointed to celebrate the passover seven days (Num 26:7). THE CATHOLIC PRIESTHOOD OF MIOM, the term denoting the place of consecration and commemorating the sacrifice of a lamb, is the term by which Jesus is so commonly used elsewhere in Matthew's account of the apostolic ministry (Mt 5:7, 20), and, indeed, is the name of the city mentioned in several places (Gk 3:11), and, to that place at least, from which the language of Matthew 5 and Luke 5 is supposed to derive. Of his baptism, which followed, or was foreshadowed, as before set forth, in Daniel 2:1-9, we are not here concerned. The transmission of the revelation of our Lord's death to the church, during these seven days, saw to it that the second advent of Christ which took place by His resurrection from the dead might be inaugurated during the same period of seven days and seven nights, \"that in the latter day ye might have hope.\"\n\n2. GENERAL TERMS.\n\nMatthew's account differs in its details from Mark's. Thus the respective use of the words of calling and of baptism is more slight than that of the same word, \"what?\" Matthew mentions the meaning of these expressions only once in his account, when it is made use of in describing the raising of Jesus from the dead. Mark makes no reference to the meaning of calling \"seven.\" The Lord's passover, relating to two important events, had occurred that day, and the people of Jerusalem, at that time, had received the new law, a law even more strict than that which was given on that same day by the prophet Jonas. Hence it was (1) necessary to prepare the sacrifices, which would pass away. (2) It was also necessary to prepare his body for its final apogee, as well as for the assimilation of his spiritual body to the body of the Church. (3) Lastly, the law had to be fulfilled by our Lord.\n\n3. EXPOSITION OF SHORT TERMS.\n\nIn Matthew's account, the words denoting the meaning of the ten commandments (says St. Paul in 1 Cor. 15:22-30) occurring three times are combined with the words \"that they might be fulfilled,\" that is, that seven days should pass away, and that Jesus should be raised from the dead. Thus we have the words \"that shall be fulfilled,\" (Lk 2:24). Hence Jesus was seated on the right hand of God at his symbolic throne upon the sun, and the clouds and the light of the sun were above him, just as they might have been were it not for the lighting of the thousandfold sun symbolized by the visible length of the forty-nine years of preaching, during which neither the power nor the strength of the Pharisees could prevail (Dan. 4:10-23).\n\nFollowing the sequence described in the previous paragraph, the blessings of regeneration and the holy temple which were to be given to the people at that time, are described, if we disregard Mark's tripartite phraseology. The Old Testament language of the will of God (which makes certain precepts of The Law applicable to the dispensation of time) is especially clear in respect to these phenomena; and as we have already noted, Matthew uses from Genesis, 17:11-27 to make the passages of the law apply to the Pentateuch (Greek, onion), the language of which we have already indicated is at variance with the Greek Septuagint translation of the Pentateuch (Haggai. 119a). \"Before unto this time--the Old Testament phrase, \"and before that time\" is used in Mark (Matthew 2:1, 10) to denote the period between the spring and autumnal solstice of the first-days of the month, when the operation is celebrated, and the commandment of the law is to be fulfilled; whereas in Matthew we have a similar rendering, \"before the stars went up to heaven\" (Lk 1:37). In Luke's account, the expression \"before that time\" denotes the era of time before the golden rule had been instituted in the Sabbaths of Egypt, and of which it is a summary in Exodus 34:29-30, and in Leviticus 4:5 the texts follow the lines already given.\n\nIn the fulness of time (which denotes Mark's attitude toward the end of the Pentateuch) what is called the \"spiritual gifts\" to the children of Israel were to be given (in Matthew 10:15-17, and John 12:22-24); and \"marvelous signs\" (Luke 6:15-", "human": "CHAPTER 12\n\nJohn 12:1-11 . THE ANOINTING AT BETHANY.\n\n1-8. six days before the passover--that is, on the sixth day before it; probably after sunset on Friday evening, or the commencement of the Jewish sabbath preceding the passover.\n\n2. Martha served--This, with what is afterwards said of Mary's way of honoring her Lord, is so true to the character in which those two women appear in Luke 10:38-42 , as to constitute one of the strongest and most delightful confirmations of the truth of both narratives. (See also on John 11:20 ).\n\nLazarus . . . sat at the table--\"Between the raised Lazarus and the healed leper (Simon, Mark 14:3 ), the Lord probably sits as between two trophies of His glory\" [STIER].\n\n3. spikenard--or pure nard, a celebrated aromatic ( Solomon 1:12 ).\n\nanointed the feet of Jesus--and \"poured it on His head\" ( Matthew 26:7 , 14:3 ). The only use of this was to refresh and exhilarate--a grateful compliment in the East, amidst the closeness of a heated atmosphere, with many guests at a feast. Such was the form in which Mary's love to Christ, at so much cost to herself, poured itself out.\n\n4. Judas . . . who should betray him--For the reason why this is here\n\n5. three hundred pence--about $50.\n\n6. had the bag--the purse.\n\nbare what was put therein--not, bare it off by theft, though that he did; but simply, had charge of its contents, was treasurer to Jesus and the Twelve. How worthy of notice is this arrangement, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property! The purposes which this served are obvious enough; but it is further noticeable, that the remotest hint was never given to the eleven of His true character, nor did the disciples most favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes before he voluntarily separated himself from their company--for ever!\n\n7. said Jesus, Let her alone, against the day of my burying hath she done this--not that she thought of His burial, much less reserved any of her nard to anoint her dead Lord. But as the time was so near at hand when that office would have to be performed, and she was not to have that privilege even alter the spices were brought for the purpose ( Mark 16:1 ), He lovingly regards it as done now.\n\n8. the poor always . . . with you--referring to Deuteronomy 15:11 .\n\nbut me . . . not always--a gentle hint of His approaching departure. He adds ( Mark 14:8 ), \"She hath done what she could,\" a noble testimony, embodying a principle of immense importance. \"Verily, I say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her\" ( Matthew 26:13 , 14:9 ). \"In the act of love done to Him she had erected to herself an eternal monument, as lasting as the Gospel, the eternal word of God. From generation to generation this remarkable prophecy of the Lord has been fulfilled; and even we, in explaining this saying of the Redeemer, of necessity contribute to its accomplishment\" [OLSHAUSEN]. \"Who but Himself had the power to ensure to any work of man, even if resounding in his own time through the whole earth, an imperishable remembrance in the stream of history? Behold once more here, the majesty of His royal judicial supremacy in the government of the world, in this, Verily I say unto you\" [STIER]. Beautiful are the lessons here: (1) Love to Christ transfigures the humblest services. All, indeed, who have themselves a heart value its least outgoings beyond the most costly mechanical performances; but how does it endear the Saviour to us to find Him endorsing the principle as His own standard in judging of character and deeds!\n\nWhat though in poor and humble guise\n\nThou here didst sojourn, cottage-born,\n\nYet from Thy glory in the skies\n\nOur earthly gold Thou didst not scorn.\n\nFor Love delights to bring her best,\n\nAnd where Love is, that offering evermore is blest.\n\nLove on the Saviour's dying head\n\nHer spikenard drops unblam'd may pour,\n\nMay mount His cross, and wrap Him dead\n\nIn spices from the golden shore.\n\nKEBLE", "eta_suffix": " in the Temple as well as in the Jewish Sabbath (Temple Mount).

the ninth episode of Season 1 , and overall the ninth produced hour of Hannibal . It originally aired on May 23, 2013.\n\nThe BAU team hunts a serial killer who digs up his victims, creating a totem pole of their bodies as a macabre trophy. When Nick Boyle's body is found, Jack & Alana question Abigail about his death. The resurrection of Nick's body enlightens Will to some of Abigail's secrets and Hannibal convinces Will to keep some of his own. Attempting to assert independence, Abigail agrees to write a book with Freddie Lounds and in the process, reveals her biggest secret to Hannibal.\n\nSynopsis Edit\n\nIn her psychiatric hospital, Abigail Hobbs irrationally holds herself responsiblefor the murders her father committed; if only Abigail were dead instead of Garret Jacob Hobbs ' victims, the innocents would still be alive.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Grafton, West Virginia, the FBI finds a totem pole composed of human corpses on a snow-covered beach. Only one of the bodies is recently killed - the rest were dug up. Jack clears the crime scene and allows Will to dive inside the mind of the killer. Will realizes that whoever did this utilized careful premeditation; they wanted their last, still breathing victim to watch it all before they died. And then, once the totem pole was assembled, the killer stabbed his final victim inthe heart and placed his corpse at the very top.\n\n\nWill blinks and, in an instant, finds himself sitting in Hannibal 's office. Will has no idea how he got there and begins to panic. Hannibal suggests Will has an empathy disorder; he cares so much about his victims and the crimescommitted against them that his conscious choice to ignore those feelings is negatively affecting his brain. Lecter says Will's life is separating from reality. Will admits he's been sleepwalking and wonders if he should get a CAT scan. But Hannibal knows the truth: Will's job is crushing him, and his decision to put others' lives above his own might end up being the death of Will...\n\n\nThe families of Garrett Jacob Hobbs' victims have filed wrongful death suits against his estate, which means his surviving daughter, Abigail, has nothing to her name. In the hospital, Freddie Lounds comforts Abigail and promises her she'll make money of her own someday. When Abigail wonders if her story could fetch a payday as a book,Freddie jumps on the idea - she can write it for Abigail, but promises it will be \"her story.\" Freddie encourages Abigail to keep the deal between them and not involve anyone else, like Will Graham. After a moment of thinking, Abigail agrees to write a book on her life with Freddie's help.\n\n\nWill visits Jack and apologizes for letting the totem pole crime scene get to him. Jack is worried about Graham, but Will assures him he's over it and ready to move on.\n\n\nIn forensics, Jimmy Price and Beverly Katz explain the bodies came from graves around the crime scene, mostly wrongful deaths, which suggest previous murders. The one on top - the most recent murder - is Joshua Summers a single stab wound to the heart. Will glances at the crime scene photos and knows all 17 dead bodies were murdered. This is about the killer meshing his past with his present.\n\n\nWill details the facts of the totem pole murders to his class, but when Alana Bloom interrupts, he quickly realizes the whole thing was occurring inside of his head. Will is alone in his darkened classroom, speaking to himself. When Alana enters, Will apologizes for kissing her earlier, but she didn't mind - in fact, she liked it. Alana regrets leaving his house that night, but is currently on the fence about her feelings for Will. She really likes him, but knows they can never have a relationship if he's in his current unstable state. When Alana asks Will if he's unstable, he bashfully nods his head.\n\n\nAt the psychiatric hospital, Will and Hannibal try to dissuade Abigail from writing a tell-all book with Freddie Lounds. If Abigail publishes this book, she'll be putting her privacy - along with Hannibal and Will's privacy - in jeopardy. Abigail just wants the truth to come out, but once the door is open, Abigail will have no control over what people say or write about her. Is she ready for that?\n\nWill's had a revelation about the case; totem poles tell a story, from the top to the bottom. This killer might be tracing his criminal history chronologically.

{"eta": "By Matthew P. Goodman and Michael J. Green, Special to CNN\n\nEditor's note: Matthew P. Goodman and Michael J. Green are based at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The views expressed in this commentary are theirs.\n\n(CNN) If you don't like Trump, don't vote for him.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for that: He's a real politician, and his rhetoric can often lead him to step on our toes. But there's more to it than that.\n\nIf you dislike Trump, you want an alternative.\n\nSimply consider what happened last week, right after the billionaire businessman's speech before the Republican National Convention. The candidate's speech consisted largely of Trump talking about the economy, the military and the national debt without once mentioning Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt's not that every statement the candidate made was bad. Trump talked about free trade, the wall on the Mexican border, immigration reform and entitlement reform, and brought up Black Lives Matter activists three times during his speech. This is what a President Trump would probably do.\n\nHowever, his only paid commercial during his speech was a commercial for his real estate company, a fact that no one seemed to notice at the time. The only broadcast network to dedicate a whole hour to the economic speech was CNN.\n\nAnd while CNN ran many \"negative\" stories attacking Trump throughout the course of the week, as I discussed in my CNNMoney column, the network then ignored it, too.\n\nWhile he said a lot in one breath, Trump wasn't really answering any of the fundamental questions about Trump's character (and it is certainly true that Trump has plenty of character deficiencies). The problem was how often he was talking about policy and what it would mean for Americans -- the one thing about Trump that makes him attractive to voters.\n\nCNN's obsession with Trump has appeared to creep upward, too.\n\nWhen Trump attacked MSNBC analyst and \"Morning Joe\" co-host Joe Scarborough last week as a \"lightweight\" and a \"lightweight\" because he has not endorsed Trump, Scarborough's response was to call Trump a \"bimbo\" for being rude to one of his female staffers.\n\nScarborough and his colleagues complained that Trump had insulted their female colleagues, which would have been wrong (and sexist). Trump, though, said Scarborough was a loser who couldn't be a news anchor because he's a woman. Scarborough tweeted that Trump also called him \"low I.Q.\" That's just vulgar.\n\nNBC fired back with a headline: \"SNL lampoons Trump with scathing skit.\"\n\nIn the second draft of \"Saturday Night Live's\" 40th season premiere on Tuesday, the star was dead serious. He complained that nobody told him Trump was \"a bully like you don't know -- and not just because of his mouth.\"\n\nAccording to the record, he does know. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Trump said he thought it was inappropriate for him to treat him like a king because he's a billionaire. Trump then seemed to revive a few of his previously repeated insults about the \"dishonest\" media during the campaign, ranting, \"We'll be interviewed by the media, and they're going to call us crooked, as opposed to crooked reporters.\"\n\nThat's sarcasm, and it's offensive as hell.\n\nCNN and MSNBC aren't the first to try to redefine an opponent's character by taking credit for specific things that are not. In the 2016 election, Republican pollster Frank Luntz used Clinton's supposed collusion with Russia as evidence of her dishonesty. Both publications ignored that Clinton insisted that the use of private email servers was never intentional, that she wiped her devices clean, and that she's never leaked any classified information for any reason.\n\nThen there was George W. Bush's infamous \"If you bring a knife to a gun fight, you get more knives\" quote. He's certainly never helped his credibility with a print interview in which he used the quote in reference to how, in retrospect, he might have given people with cancer more hope. But he used the quote in some form or fashion on 90 different occasions, including six full interviews.\n\nTime magazine credited Bush with using the quote about the Iraq War publicly, and before them, Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California said he told her to \"Get the hell off my lawn. And she did. Thank God.\"\n\nOK, fine, but anyone who took this quote seriously saw through Bush's cynical spin.\n\nNow, would the Clinton campaign respond to these kind of exchanges without lazily puffing out his chest and pretending he's not talking about Trump? Certainly not. Does anyone seriously think Clinton's campaign would stick with her past comments and not, in the last month alone, emphasize those that would get her in trouble with Republicans?\n\nSomeone who's endorsed Trump is never going to be deferential as to what he says to his", "topp": "By Matthew P. Goodman and Michael J. Green, Special to CNN\n\nEditor's note: Matthew P. Goodman and Michael J. Green are based at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The views expressed in this commentary are theirs.\n\n(CNN) If you don't like sports, don't come to a victory parade for a football team.\n\nOr as we like to say in Philly, how do you like them apples?\n\nUntil a few years ago, it seemed that mere events such as Super Bowls or World Series games could be forgotten amid the fireworks, stray dogs and sometimes fraught confrontations that serenade the city. Then as now, conflict was more a fact of life for Philadelphia -- and more about respect than the glittering trappings of success.\n\n\"It's Philadelphia and it's complicated,\" says the city's former Mayor Michael Nutter.\n\nYet as they shake off the usually calm waters after a Philadelphia Eagles victory, owners of professional football franchises will visit the city and -- if they choose -- roll up their sleeves, show their teammates their scars and give thanks for the relationships and donations the city can boast about (and some of which were made at public expense).\n\nCNN can reveal that almost no pro football team outside of Philadelphia has the economic clout to be on display in the city. Though newly building stadiums attract the most attention, shepherding an NFL franchise from one area to another requires the guidance of local political players, department heads and city attorneys.\n\nIn a country in which NFL teams are relatively healthy and typically heavily featured on local TV, it's extremely rare for the league to venture out of the North Side of Philadelphia. The city seems to realize that any team that can't provide an immediate boost to the economy will lose a good portion of its interest.\n\nBut Philadelphia -- and many other municipalities -- has a new wrinkle on its prospective routes to the NFL as MLB and the NFL create a joint entity dedicated to linking local fans to their franchises. This seems certain to make lives easier for the teams.\n\nIn the coming months, I will explore the details of what Philadelphia has in store for one of pro sports' biggest franchises: the Philadelphia Eagles, which could bring soccer star Claudio Reyna with them.\n\nHere's what we'll learn:\n\nCan Philadelphia tap into the passion of fans of other major teams?\n\nNFL schedule: Reality or dream?\n\nIf the potential Philadelphia attendance numbers are a proxy for the pro sports market, the answer seems to be a resounding \"dream.\"\n\nToday the Bills, Ravens, Steelers, Giants, Eagles, Cowboys and Colts all play in a city -- in question: Philadelphia -- and the Eagles sit dead last. That's according to the 2012 study \"Stadium Attraction in the NFL.\"\n\nThe eight remaining teams -- the Packers, Bears, Redskins, 49ers, Broncos, Cowboys, Vikings and Eagles -- most of which were added in the past five years -- and their home markets each ranked dead last.\n\nIn fact, the study found that only one team -- the Dolphins -- would attract more than a top 15 fan base.\n\nAnd after Las Vegas, the only major city in which football teams can draw strong support is in Honolulu, which has as many as half a million fans each game, according to ESPN's \"Wish-We-Could-Play.\" Those fans aren't fans of the teams they attend, however. They're fans of tourism, family nightlife and some level of fandom.\n\nThere were never many NFL teams in Philadelphia, anyway. Football is as new to local geography as snow in New England was to Canadian winter and use of leather in the Wild West.\n\nPhiladelphia has been watching pro football via broadcasts since the Great Gatsby operated for a decade from city hall in 1890. It wasn't until 1961 that Likud Party hero and eventual prime minister David Ben Gurion bought ownership of the team.\n\nBen Gurion keeps his papers in his office.\n\nA rock in Pittsburgh.\n\nLike many cities with active minor leagues, Philadelphia's minor leagues have remained green. The capacity of some clubs in minor leagues is 45,000-plus. By comparison, the 30,000-plus per-game capacity of the current Philadelphia Phillies is comparable to the small market abilities of some of the market's top minor league teams.\n\nAll it took was a little propaganda from baseball's then-owner and then-MLB commissioner Grover Cleveland Alexander to revitalize the Philadelphia franchise in the early 1970s. Several players, mostly in their 20s and 30s, rose to the professional ranks; Terry Kiekhee went to Baltimore after two seasons with the Phillies; Jimmy McGowan, long a favorite of Philly fans and a second baseman for the Cleveland Indians, reached the majors with the Padres in 1986. There were soon more such players and headline creators.\n\nToday the Phillies are as celebrated as their namesake, but", "human": "By Matthew P. Goodman and Michael J. Green, Special to CNN\n\nEditor's note: Matthew P. Goodman and Michael J. Green are based at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Both have worked on Asia policy in senior positions at the White House. The views expressed are their own.\n\nSince the first merchant ship of the new American republic set sail from New York for Canton in 1784, trade has been at the heart of U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific. Deepening economic exchange with the world's most dynamic region has not only promoted American prosperity; it has also been an essential underpinning of the U.S. military and diplomatic presence in the region.\n\nThis is why President Bush launched the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and why the Obama administration is redoubling its efforts to conclude a TPP agreement by the end of this year as a central part of its \"pivot\" to Asia. And it is why the administration should welcome Japan, Asia's second-largest economy and America's leading ally in the region, into TPP following Tokyo's historic decision to seek entry into the talks.\n\nJoining TPP is the most consequential element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's three-part strategy to revive the Japanese economy through aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reform (collectively dubbed \"Abenomics\"). To meet TPP's high ambitions for market opening and 21st century rules of the road for trade and investment, Japan will need to undertake politically sensitive reforms of its agriculture and services sectors, labor markets, and regulatory practices.\n\nThose of us who have been following Japan for the past 30 years look at the structural reform \"arrow\" of Abenomics with a skeptical eye. So many plans and slogans to overhaul the Japanese economy have come and gone: Yasuhiro Nakasone's campaign in the mid-80s to \"join hands with the world through imports;\" the Miyazawa Plan of the early 1990s, named for another former prime minister, to make Japan a \"lifestyle superpower;\" the aborted efforts of Japan's last leader, Yoshihiko Noda, to join TPP in late 2011. Only Junichiro Koizumi's financial and postal reforms of a decade ago stand out as meaningful and sustained.\n\nBut this time the stars have aligned to make the prospects for lasting reform real. The economic struggles of the past two decades have made Japanese companies big and small afraid of falling behind in global competition, and business groups have come out strongly in support of TPP entry. Opinion polls show that a majority of Japanese voters support TPP as well. And, following an earlier stint in office during which he paid little attention to the economy, Abe has discovered that good economic policy can be good politics: largely on the back of Abenomics, his approval rating has rocketed above 70 percent.\n\nTo be sure, Abe faces outspoken opposition to his structural reform plans within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Japan's agriculture lobby, an important supporter of the LDP, remains a formidable opponent of reform. The rural vote will be particularly important as Abe seeks to regain an LDP coalition majority in Upper House elections in July \u2013 a victory that could cement his hold on power for several years.\n\nIn campaigning for office last fall, Abe repeatedly promised not to join TPP if the price was eliminating Japan's high agriculture tariffs upon entry \u2013 a clever formulation if he decided to push ahead once in office, since no country goes into trade negotiations giving away the store. In a tortuously crafted statement after his summit with President Obama late last month, Abe got the assurances he needed. In exchange, he acknowledged that everything would be on the table for negotiation and agreed to address U.S. concerns about Japan's automobile and insurance markets.\n\nThe decision to push to join TPP marks a major milestone for Japan. It should be a catalyst for the structural reforms the country so badly needs to raise productivity and growth in the face of a declining workforce. Japan's urban consumers may no longer need to pay 8 times the world price for rice to protect a dwindling farm population. The market opening and strengthened rules under a TPP agreement will give Japanese exporters new opportunities in growing Asia-Pacific markets. Estimates are that TPP entry could raise Japanese GDP by 0.5 percent per annum.\n\nA stronger Japan would bring significant strategic benefits to both Japan and the United States. Today, Tokyo is the second largest contributor to the U.N. system and international financial institutions like the World Bank, and the most generous supporter of the U.S. forward military presence. Moreover, as large emerging countries like China and India insist on greater voice in global governance, Tokyo and Washington share a strong interest in updating and upholding the system of rules that underpins the international economy. TPP is the most serious endeavor underway worldwide to do this.\n\nFrom a U.S. perspective, the practical and political challenges of bringing Japan into TPP are considerable.

In a town where politicians sit in the living room laughing at ridiculous campaign slogans and spending $100,000 on the TV ads that will paint their opponents as spineless lapdog puppets at best and liars at worst, why would a Member of Congress choose to try and act like this is real life, especially when his or her constituents are already being torn apart in real life?\n\nA week ago, the Committee's chairman, Utah's Jason Chaffetz, announced the Committee would hold its first public hearing on Donald Trump University on May 5th. On March 29, 2016, The Washington Post stated that President Obama had signed off on the granting of Trump University the coveted exemption, which allows for up to $25,000 per day. After this news broke, I found myself in despair. I thought of my fellow Utahns and asked myself, could Trump win again in such a weak field of GOP candidates? If Trump was capable of winning Utah, what could we expect next?\n\nAs Utah residents, we have experienced tragedy and upheaval over the last several years. Things have gone from positive to extremely sad, and people don't know where to turn for support. People ask, \"What would I do if my husband, son or daughter would run for public office?\" A week later, the average voter in Utah thinks I'm a crazy man. I looked through my own social media feed, and found dozens of people for whom I care. How many Republicans want to run for public office? If there were one thousand Utahns doing it, where would they start? They had the opportunity to be a part of the campaign of a great man like Mitt Romney. Today, a Republican President (Romney) is in the White House. A person like Donald Trump is better qualified than Mitt Romney to do the job. A Presidential hopeful who failed to disclose his vast wealth would not have the advantage of experience, the same candidate who accepted millions of dollars in speaking fees by hiding the source of his income. If his political endeavors could not be financed by others, he would never get in the Republican nomination for President, and Americans would never know who he is or would trust to represent them.\n\nAs citizens of Utah, it is my great sorrow and great pleasure that the establishment you are now claiming to respect and represent has proven to be entirely dishonest toward Utah and most Americans. You are clearly convinced in your words and actions that you are entitled to be the President. You say that, despite having received legal advice from President Obama not to do so, the Committee is doing so because it wants to \"protect\" the President. But then you make a miscalculation with that statement, and drop the \"The United States of America\" and change the word \"the\" to \"The United States Congress.\" This miscalculation only fuels more cynicism about your lack of legitimacy.\n\nPresident Obama has issued a broad grant of executive authority to make enforcement of laws easier and clearer. The question you seem not to understand is that the language of your own proposed legislation and bill is so far removed from that of any Obama regulation. You propose that the president ask the IRS and the Federal Trade Commission to do their jobs. Yet the threat of civil penalties in the proposed legislation is far greater than anything the IRS, FTC, or the Obama administration is currently doing to enforce laws.\n\nIn a similar process, I have also authored legislation that President Obama did sign into law that removed the requirement to register and report the income of foreign corporations which invest in the United States. To my knowledge, no U.S. corporation or person is required to file a tax return or a report to the IRS or a consumer credit reporting agency. Foreign corporations are allowed to invest in the United States. My legislation increases this legal certainty and legal certainty only occurs when that law is enforced.\n\nPresident Obama also expanded the consumer security provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which creates a community credit reporting program that is now recognized by more than 250,000 small businesses across the United States. However, you were able to derail the bill because you did not seem to be able to understand how this major move would be enforced.

The Committee is headed by a group of people who have spent the past several decades serving as consummate Washington insiders. Members of the Committee, for the most part, represent their respective districts and are paid salaries from the government. These top people represent the institution. Most of them know its financials and have sensitive and personal information of their constituents.\n\nThe Committee is run by members with deep interests in the institution's history and operations. Many of these folks have viewed all of the issues surrounding the scandal surrounding Trump University as largely negative at best and laudable at worst. Many of these same people have no problem tying together a new lawsuit alleging fraud to win public support or organizing support behind a grandstanding resolution designed to force Trump to release his tax returns. You might remember, also, that Steve Stockman's campaign at the time of the 2012 election was perceived by many to be flirting with the idea of nominating an anti-Trump candidate in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nThe Committee, by all appearances, was engaged in a regime change kind of move. It was examining and condoning the actions of the man who was duly elected president. During the hearing itself, you even went so far as to characterize some of Trump's policies as being \"toxic\" and \"toxic behavior.\" These are all observations that are bound to put the once impressive reputation of this committee into question.\n\nFrom day one, Trump University was accused of deceptive practices and fraud. But the forensic audit of the institution was one of the largest, longest, and most expensive in history. How would the members of the Committee and the select committee staff have responded to the attack on Trump University? Were they under pressure to hear positive stories about Trump's company and the businessman's businesses? If so, how would they have done so without appearing to participate in fraudulent conduct by advancing false allegations of Trump University fraud? The fact that they had the opportunity to examine these issues raises fundamental questions about the integrity of the Committee and what it is truly capable of.\n\nIf you are in charge of such an organization, you must do a great job of holding staff members accountable. You cannot only turn them loose on individuals but also it makes no sense to rush, while the attorney general's office is busy in an unrelated investigation, to appoint a new chairman who will be asked to step aside. Instead, once in charge of the hearing, you put this particular hearing into its endgame as you move to force Trump to prove, to the world, that he doesn't have any business practice.\n\nA quick review of what the establishment uses to cheat at U.S. elections turns up other examples of organizations corrupt and thus harmful to the public. All in all, the Committee was forced to acknowledge one thing. It is left to be, frankly, delightful for Trump to be held liable for his personal conduct as a businessman: billionaires do not generally ask for an audit of their businesses.\n\nTherefore, your deliberate method of holding Trump, if he is responsible, accountable makes a mockery of your view as to what this Committee can be. You are not obliged to hold this Committee accountable to ethical norms that encourage it to take on ongoing issues from the past. Consider with me, Mr. Chairman: Should any committee in a democracy take on complete responsibility for the unethical conduct of the career actors who ran this institution, and should anyone be allowed to voice that claim in a public hearing? Would that at the outset of a new career for you, Mr. Chairman, have led to a marketplace where the first concern would be to face the nominee's baggage in the press, promising to champion his campaign's proposals, or to put forward his reasons for being selected? I have no opinion on that as I did not enter this service.\n\nI had hoped that the two of you would deliver your verdict quickly. Maybe the filing of the complaint by the Attorney General's office will take place over the weekend. Or maybe, just maybe, as you ponder its implications for whether you serve up yet another show prosecution of President Trump, consider the headline you might write up by this time next week: \"DOJ says the panel of 58 Trump administrators really did select Trump vs. DNC complaint.\"\n\nEither way, it seems that you have little time left to effectively do what I advised you in the past: Make the reasons he brings to light\u2014criminal, consumer or otherwise\u2014sound compelling enough to support the majority of the American people as to justify opposition to him as commander-in-chief.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBerndt E.

For example, during an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump stated, \"The law's totally on my side, the president can't have a conflict of interest.\"\n\nOf course, this statement is incorrect. Mr. Trump can \u2015 and already does \u2015 have obvious conflicts of interest between his widespread global business interests and his Constitutional obligations as president.\n\nThe relevant question is whether he will follow the model set by his predecessors to mitigate these conflicts by liquidating his assets and placing them in a blind trust. If he refuses, then Congress must fulfill our own responsibilities by closely examining the Constitutional and statutory provisions that govern Mr. Trump's actions, determining whether his approach meets these standards, and proposing appropriate reforms to address any problems we identify.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Trump does not appear to be taking these concerns seriously. On November 21, 2016, he tweeted, \"Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!\"\n\nAgain, this statement is clearly incorrect. The nation's leading Republican and Democratic ethics scholars have called on Mr. Trump to place his financial holdings in a blind trust.\n\nFor example, the top ethics counsels for former President George W. Bush, Richard Painter, and President Barack Obama, Norman Eisen, published an op-ed in The Washington Post titled, \"Trump's 'Blind Trust' is Neither Blind Nor Trustworthy.\" They wrote:\n\nDonald Trump must urgently rethink his plan to allow his children to run his businesses. As drastic as it may seem to him, he should instead put all his conflict-generating assets in a true blind trust run by an independent trustee. The good of his own administration, and that of the country, demand nothing less.\n\nMr. Painter and Ambassador Eisen recommend that Mr. Trump \"appoint an independent professional trustee to take charge of liquidating and converting to cash Trump business holdings through an initial public offering or leveraged buyout.\" Second, they recommend that the proceeds \"be turned over to the trustee to be managed.\" Third, they recommend that as long as Mr. Trump's children and their spouses are dealing with Mr. Trump's business matters, \"he should ask them to step away from the transition team and the White House, and to not advise him or be involved in any U.S. government affairs.\"\n\nSimilarly, a group of 19 government accountability experts and organizations called on Mr. Trump to place his assets into a blind trust. They wrote:\n\nContacts about the Trump businesses should be prohibited between all other administration officials and people involved in the businesses, including any of the children who maintain an ongoing involvement with the businesses. Except for personal communication with the president or first lady, such telephone calls and emails should be routed to the White House counsel to make sure that the firewall is not breached.\n\nEven The Wall Street Journal's editorial board argued that \"Mr. Trump's best option is to liquidate his stake in the company.\" In addition, the editorial board of The Salt Lake Tribune agreed with Ranking Member Cummings' request to conduct a rigorous review, writing: \"that, if he wants anyone to take him seriously, is exactly what Chaffetz and his Oversight Committee should start preparing to do.\"\n\nGlobal Scope of President-Elect's Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe scope of Mr. Trump's conflicts of interest around the world is unprecedented.

{"eta": "Grounding of the Queen Elizabeth 2 (response) - 26/06/2009\n\nThe Rest of the Story\n\nNick Perugini\n\nLast month we brought you the exciting news that the single speed phase III of the Four Feathers would be running on the river between Whipps Cross and the village of Bulwell. The original plan was to run it all the way up, and to have a pile field for the beached boats in place for the finish. For the past five weekends, that hasn't been possible as the new phase III plan has encountered some kind of bureaucratic roadblock which had to be fought to get it going. If you haven't been following this story, it's pretty straight forward. We covered all the facts (and the somewhat amusing reasoning for why the single speed phase III did not go ahead) back in April, when the council were arguing about the agenda for the council meeting and wanting to make it clear whether or not they would back a plan (which was for a 10% increase on the existing 5% speed limit) to replace the double speed limits with a single speed limit on the river.\n\nThe council have had to deal with some muddled thinking in the interim and so it has been forced to call a meeting to make its case. The meeting would have been of the nature of a form letter. Except, during the conversation we were told that it wasn't going to happen. The other option was to consult their project management committee then have the project management committee come back and try to argue for the current plan. Which has no apparent value whatsoever.\n\n\nIt turns out that the council did this to avoid a meeting between the council and the website. They claimed that a meeting was needed due to the fact that the internet was all down at the time but despite the fact that the council and website did not have a communications set-up to exchange information, the people running the website have been unable to reach a solution. The website currently only links to the council meeting date - meaning you get a beached boat date but there is no way to see if the boat has been beached or not. There are several options though but which one is the most palatable?\n\n\nTo cut a long story short, neither the council or the planning officers have any idea about what the actual plan is or where the money is coming from or how the funds are being spent and so the council have decided to not go ahead with the single speed phase III on Whipps Cross. Also, the decision is made without the benefit of the current inspection system. Currently, if there is any issue with a boat at all, which could be a police arrest, the previous post is alerted but the post is then \"merged\" if there is no response. The problem with the current inspection system is that it doesn't work until after the boat is washed away in the river and then it simply takes them too long just to tell you about the problem - therefore they don't know the details that might make some difference to their decision.\n\nNick Perugini\n\nSorry for any confusion on this one but as yet we have not had any confirmed information from the council or the project management committee. We've obviously got quite a few issues left to tackle before the meeting is, and I've stated this in last week's post before a traffic block - but I think we've got all the necessary information now to make our case.\n\nNick Perugini\n\nProposed NOV 4th Revision for alternative route (Response)\n\nThe Rest of the Story\n\nNick Perugini\n\nIn the aftermath of the news you didn't miss the detail about the Long Dock station being closed. It seems that the RCU chose to enter into a joint venture agreement with the government of Taiwan to build a railway on Long Dock. Taipei is a former client of the RCU and their plans for this property were known to the RCU prior to the policy change and have been formulated by a variety of parties. It is believed this agreement covers a variety of potential developments around Long Dock which will most certainly include possible new stations along the waterfront at the Green Park intersection or at the edge of the property.\n\nA ferry terminal is already planned to rise in the western terminus of the Triple Junction. The twin locations will be used by ferry operators and officials to manage and transfer passengers to the nearby buildings.\n\nNick Perugini\n\nPlanning Committee Discussion (response) - 13/06/2009\n\nThe Rest of the Story\n\nNick Perugini\n\nJust to put the announcement in some context (and I think we did just this a couple of weeks ago when the document outlining plan proposal was released), the revised transport scheme would see the increased speed limits of the Four Feathers Motorway coming out of view and merging with the Circle and Green Belt cycleways.\n\nLong Dock station is moving into an area known as the Green Park - and would comprise a garage at the bottom of", "topp": "Grounding of the Queen Elizabeth 2 (response) - 26/06/2009\n\nThe Rest of the Story\n\nNick Perugini\n\nLast month we brought you the exciting news that the single speed fine tuning of the Four Feathers would be running over the summer, and that a new timetable and being stable and consistent would mean that the A27 was not to be shut down, and to have to get rid of the behemoths in that section, which meant the removal of the Sevenoaks bridge and its biggest ever platform of double decker trains. The remaining pair, Strand Road, and Hopper Bridge, would most likely remain operational for trains passing under the Thames, with a relief work platform designed for three level crossings being built for the Barneses Ferry line, however no details have been revealed about the length of time it would take. Further test runs are planned for early 2007. By doing everything carefully one can slow down these cranes as much as possible, as this move will make the \"everywhere\" phase of the project much quicker; there is no need for them to focus on stopping trains from opening the door.\n\nIt had appeared for some time that the northbound tunnel was a walk in the park, with only two mega junctions (North Bridge and Barneses) being of the size of a major motorway. The results of the first branch test were positive, and the South East London line was in for a first step reversal of sorts. In the process this removed the roadblocks needed to cope with the smaller number of trains which no longer turn right on the new single lanes, and instead have a one or two-way emergency left turn which is possible under either side of the new railway. You can hardly blame the operators who took all the space they needed to accommodate cars turning left to enter and leave the tunnel from the northbound direction: \"we gave them the area and they pointed at it and said we can use it\".\n\nStopping trains from going through Barneses, trains from the southbound side have turned right so they can enter the tunnel and cars are held up at the Northbound platform for several hundred yards whilst further northbound trains enter the tunnel, and can provide only a single end delay. The cars have to be placed in the correct position and platforms designed for two platforms or two tracks. The problem in Barneses, where two tracks are used, is that the platform level is uneven, and as the track level is only 1-2m above the width of the tunnel, tracks are terminated and these items are awkwardly placed in four positions: at the top of the track at the back of the platform itself, next to the vehicles from the south, just before the train as it enters the tunnel (to prevent them hitting the junctions and being re-routed to Kentish Town), and also quite a lot of the side platform for over 8000 vehicles. Those problems were overcome by coming up with some bizarre solutions. At the Northbound platform they used to hold some special wheel cars, which were so badly built that the children used to throw stones at them, but they eventually had to buy new ones. All the screwless track fence looked fairly bulky and they couldn't have any dodgy future running stuff there, it would kill the trains and their passengers. This required trimming of that portion of the yard, and the number of deck rods required to avoid the trains intersecting the yard once they entered the tunnel. To have a replacement deck made they had to remove a row of railings into the tunnel which blocked the passenger train when it was on the platform. Once these were removed the screws to hold the double deckers were removed from the train station and used to set a substitute deck at place.\n\nIf you didn't follow the paper trail then you'd think we'd been banned from doing this sort of thing for five years. It has all paid off. The machines from Kentish Town are already running in the tunnels, and her trains, where they were cutting inside the tunnel surface, have stopped and are now running on the Birmingham River Bridge which was under construction, and can be expected to link at the Gillingham or Kingston end as soon as this weekend. Leeds was thrilled. A quick look round the shops and stores shows that 25% of the mall area has already been pre-sold since the weekend and the proposal and work goes ahead in fine style.\n\nNow the Queens Road tunnel is of extraordinary engineering and technical importance: it is the single road in the world which has a one way super-high speed tunnel with nine carriageways and can carry 30m-400m of depth as people turn left and right. It also has the highest risk of tunnel collapse of any major transport scheme in the world.

On the next few pages we give NOAA the opportunity to respond to this.\n\nGrounding incidentsinvolving nautical charts are ex-tremely rare. However, when they do occur, the legal issue usually boils down to whether the hydrographic office was negligent by not con-ducting surveys or applying information to the chart in con-formance with their stated standards. The counter argument involves whether the mariner's actions were the principal cause of the grounding. In the case of the QE2 grounding, there are arguments to be made on both sides. In my opinion, captain Lusk offers a one-dimensional narrative of the QE2 grounding that is grossly incomplete. Mariners and hydrographers need to understand 'the rest of the story' before arriving at their own conclusion about the grounding of the QE2.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nIt was the final evening of a five-day pleasure cruise for the 1,824 pas-sengers aboard the UK passenger vessel QE2. Suddenly, the 963-foot ocean liner shook with unexpected vibration. Officers and crew on the bridge recalled two separate periods of shaking and rumblings. The mas-ter recollected that the bridge equipment rattled and shook as if it were in heavy seas. Many of the pas-sengers felt a change in the ship's motion \u2013 some thought that a severe impact had occurred. Unfortunately, there was significant damage to the bottom of the QE2. Four of the 36 double-bottom tanks that had been empty were now filled with water and open to the sea. The US Coast Guard was notified and the ship was ordered to anchor in Rhode Island Sound, some 20 miles southeast of Newport, Rhode Island.\n\n\nAnchorage to Grounding\n\nAt 21:24, after weighing anchor and manoeuvring to the west and then to the south rounding the northern shore of Martha's Vineyard, the QE2 increased speed to approximately 25 knots. Figure 1 shows the approximate outbound track of the QE2. The ship was generally following its inbound reciprocal course, heading approximately west-south-west (235\u00b0 True). At 21:44, about two-thirds of the way out of Vineyard Sound, the QE2 passed the 'NA' buoy to star-board. With the buoy abeam, the pilot altered course to the right about 15\u00b0 and was now steering a course of 250\u00b0. The pilot later testified that he intended to maintain that course until he was approximately 2 miles south of the south-western end of Cuttyhunk Island, and then steer 270\u00b0 to where he would disembark. The pilot had not told the master or the watch officer of his course change, nor of his intent to alter course to 270\u00b0 when the south-western point of Cuttyhunk Island was bearing north. Figure 2 illustrates the misunderstanding between the pilot and the captain regarding the outbound course.\n\nThe QE2's second officer plotted the new course on the ship's nautical chart and saw that the new track-line did not coincide with the original course as laid out by the ship's navigator. The second officer noted that the projected ship's track-line crossed over a 34-foot rocky shoal area approximately 7.5 miles down range in Rhode Island Sound north of the shoal called Brown's Ledge. At a speed of nearly 25 knots, the QE2 would pass over the shoal area in about 18 minutes.

If you have a battery backup you can use it to charge your battery even during boot and remove the LED after every reboot. [b][size=\"1\"]Settings\n\n[/size][/b]\n\n\nI have much more that is needed to enter the BIOS. You will need to be running the bios with ROM 1.3.0 installed as recommended before going further, if you can't find it use the attached image (adafruit_BB_BBM_V2.png). The Boot Manager button is something you can create, if you use the dynamic switch it will ask you if you want to boot with ROM1.3.0 or ROM1.0, don't do this when you see it, use the 1.0 button or the menu option to boot with ROM1.0.\n\n\nThe next steps are to create an internal GPIO9 \"Variable\" on both the dock connector pin and the two line toggles (on inside the connector.) You want to be able to disable pin-13 when the Dock is on or disable pin-11 when it is off. The GPIO9 is also used for flashing FPGA's and the eGPU that is attached to it will need to be external, located under ROM2.0 or ROM1.1 and the eGPU button on the top and the low voltage activation with a multimeter on the right or left edge and on the external port plug.\n\n\nThe next step is to create \"Joypad Ticker\". It needs to be able to both hand off to a virtual joystick and display the current position of the virtual joystick. You will also need to be connected to the eGPU from the eGPU line plug. Joypad Ticker is located in ROM2.1 or ROM1.0 and is the actual button that disables power to the eGPU. I'm very new to this but I've learned that the FPGA's had \"question marks\" running up and down the sides of the board so I clicked on one of those and determined the pins were ~0.2.0 to ~1.0 and I tied that pins directly to a specific voltage with the breadboard. I originally believed I would have to use the eGPU's voltage on the micro-controller but a while back i found this thread and figured it out; 8.3v is what the FPGA's have and eGPUs had 8.3v, same value as PC EVSTOOL and what we have in this post. You'll also need to have an RxLED-2E (1k\u03a9), Same header as the 8.3V connector. [b][size=\"1\"]Running a Boot Manager\n\n[/size][/b]\n\n\nThere are two dongles/cables that will get the VirtualJoypad running. There is a simple plug and play cable that comes with no special programming required to run the image but it takes a few minutes to set up. The other is a 12a 12V power cable that we will install in the PC. When my computer was dead, I had the DVD 1 and 2 to play and made sure they were all plugged in and activated. I ran my eGPU to where the USB has already been plugged in and created my boot order: VBOX=0 VCPU=1 NVRAM=1 NVRAM1=0 NVRAM2=1 RAM=128M RAM1=128M RAM2=128M SS=SYSCTL SSD=SYSCTL Many more commands/settings should work on your motherboard so please consult your motherboard manual or find a website and check it for details.

You will need to find the digital hookup on your eGPU so you have HDMI 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 on the same cable, the HDMI 2.0 will also be needed for the display to show your embedded content (e.g. mod files, photos) on the eGPU. We will connect our eGPU to the PC via DVI-D and HDMI 2.0 on DVI-D. The VGA connection will connect to a TV via DisplayPort and VGA.

(Galaxy S3 / Moto Razr / etc). \"Screen Standby\" will completely turn off the backlight while keeping the phone running for MHL / HDMI streaming|gaming. That means you can now watch movie / play games on big screen and can still turn off the screen (touch screen still works!) .\n\nROOT REQUIRED (Non-root method also available but not as effective & battery saving as root)\n\nQuote: FEATURES\n\n- Switch off the screen temporarily without actually putting the phone into 'sleep mode'. The phone is still running! It saves your battery, avoids heating to prolong battery life\n\n- Since 1.96, screen can be optionally turned into touchpad!\n\n- It has a nice little widget that let you quickly turn the screen off from your homescreen\n\n- Since version 1.5 beta 2, shaking your device will temporarily toggle between complete screen off and lowest brightness level (so that you can perform quick action without playing a blind guessing game)\n\n- Non-root method now available with 1.98 Beta 7\n\n- One two dimmer: Turn off screen automatically after an idling time (no user interaction)\n\n- Simple interface\n\nWHY?\n\n\nThis little app will temporarily turn off screen backlight, however, unlike putting the phone to sleep, the phone is kept running. It is perfect for keeping the phone from heating from prolonged HDMI streaming over Medialink HD or MHL connection (the screen is off yet image/movie/games continue to be streamed ) / or wifi data downloading, etc.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n\nIt attempts to perform various actions (cutting screen voltage / brightness / light switch / writing a blank image to frame buffer, etc)\n\n(Since 1.5, the voltage method is temporarily disabled)\n\nFor some devices, the screen may shutter a bit if Automatic Brightness is turned on. However, the app will automatically detect it and put the backlight into sleep again. So if you want to avoid the problem, set Automatic Brightness to false. .

They went around and took the taph or sheikh\n\nand brought it back to the mountain.

He is also considered to be the God of the gods in some Arab pagan religions. Yahweh is also the God to whom many Jews promise their protection, loyalty, and fidelity in exchange for their acceptance of Judaism. Yahweh is thought of as the deity who controls the air, the water, and the land; he is responsible for all the inhabitants of the earth including humans. His physical form resembles the God \"El,\" the divine mountain god of the Jewish people.\n\nYahweh is also known as Yahweh-El, Yahweh-Elohim, Yahweh-Elohes, and Yahweh-Elohim.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Satir Ibn Rushd, Tabrizi, Farudi, Abu Dawud, other authorities\n\nThe Caliph Umar II (d.1060) was very concerned about t'aph. He gave the order 'To throw into the blazing fire the devils (taph) and to burn the masons and pasons.' Al-Ghazali acknowledged the meaning of the word in their usage, saying, 'what I have learnt from the Qur'an is that the word taph is one of the idols [weight] that the Arabs abuse while warring amongst themselves.' A belief that both Jews and Christians take from the Qur'an, regarding t'aph is `the Jews worship two gods, namely, Allah and Kullu; while the Christians worship none other than Christ. The Jews obey God [alone], they seek guidance from Him. They are envious of those who are not guided, contemptuous of those who are not guided. They provide knowledge of this affair [bid'ah] (recall of the ten commandments). They command good, they order evil, to evil what they know, then to good what they know. They are guided by the [Islamic] law and are under the command of the righteous, descended from the blessed to be rightly guided. (Tafsir Al-Kawthar, vol. 1, p. 408)\n\nMecca (modern-day Pakistan) is considered a 'city of enemy' for Muslims. And Muslim leaders want to deprive the world from knowledge of t'aph by showing Quran to Western scientists and Intellectuals. Thus, the ploy is to remove the tafsir of the Quraish, revealing the injustice they are committed against Muslims and that they are traducing their religion which removes its honour to the Muslims. The tale goes as follows that during the time of the prophet [peace and blessings of Allah be upon him], mankind and the disbelievers were left without tafsirs, both Jews and Christians were making tafsirs. Then, knowledge spread. The world was educated. Murtada Muhammad Ibn Abi Al-Atyya from the first era (6410) stated that t'aph was the 'triad' of 'what is proper to the persons is Allah's prayer. He also said 'The souls (t'af) of the dead belong to Allah and the ruler in heaven. It is proper to it (Allah) as well to know it (Quran). Allah is superior to all of us. But instead of learning about t'aph, we find the English language spread.' Those `quarrels amongst the masons and pasons' was answered by declaring Islam as being superior to all other religions. In the Arab world, tafsir of various religions is commonly used. Scholars who claim to be non-religious condemn this modern-day manipulation on fundamental aspects of Islam and spread the light of t'aph.\n\nThe nature of t'aph is revealed in the Qur'an. It must be recited before the realization of the truth. It is contained in the following verse, (It is sira ne fado onahu. Its line end will be in 'Paralik wa ard ( 4/13).\"\n\n5. Al-Ghazali's Conception of the Subject\n\nThe author of Abul Quraish known to have a pure inclination of learning learned Abul Hashim and Arabic literature from time to time, and gained a knowledge of t'aph. Hashim's father commanded to him to memorize t'aph, and he recited the whole chapter daily. He also spent on her expenses a great deal of time, which he shared with his other sire 'Al Muhammad Ibn Kalbi. Of all the learned men and women, he may have been the best and most spiritual, like a bundle of flowers but his source of happiness was Paradise and the knowledge of the divine Sunnah. However, in a book written on the subject he stated that he did not believe in t'aph. In a letter to Imam Al Haafiz Khalifa, written on his deathbed, from Kabalah of her days, she declared, 'I do not believe in t'aph, because Allah called him, 'Al-Kirin (the faithful) and not 'Al-K", "human": "Donate To Discover The Truth\n\nContent:\n\n1.

Introduction\n\nThe details that are given in Numbers 31:18 about the female captives caught and distributed to Moses's men is disturbing for many reasons, as we read the verse closer. I have written about this verse before, however, I think we need to look at the Hebrew words closer and see how the verse was interpreted by classical ancient scholars.\n\n2. The Hebrew word \"taph\" (children)\n\nAlthough many of the translations for Numbers 31:18 render the females as being \"women\", a closer look at the verse, it refers to \"children\", prepubescent girls who have not hit puberty. This is what the Hebrew text reveals. The Hebrew word 'taf' (taph) refers to children only: BlueletterBible.org\n\nThe Hebrew word \"taf (taph) according to Lexicons.\n\nAn English and Hebrew Lexicon \u2013 Professor Selig Newman:\n\n\"CHILD , an INFANT \u2026 \u05d8\u05b7\u05e3\u2026 an offspring,\u2026 get with-\u2026\u2026\" (An English and Hebrew lexicon composed after Johnson's directory, containing fifteen thousand English words, rendered into Biblical, or rabbinical Hebrew, or into Chaldee.

The Hebrew word \"lachem\" (\"for yourselves\")\n\nThe next line we need to look at, what does \"keep alive for yourselves\" mean? When we read the verse, it does not give us much information what is meant by that. The first time I came across the verse, reading the ending, I believed it was sexual. When I got into few discussions with Christians what the end \"for yourselves\" means, they all said that the girls had to be taken care of, and wait until they grow up before they could marry an Israelite. Although such interpretation at the time was possibly plausible (so I thought), however, upon further investigation, I realized that this was not what the verse was relaying.\n\nThe words \"for yourselves\" in Hebrew is \"lachem\" (lakham):\n\nAlthough the word is unexplained, and deliberately left blank on Christian websites which explain the Bible word for word \u2013 when we consult Hebrew-English Lexicons, they give us the following meaning(s) for \"lachem\" (lakham).\n\nA complete Hebrew and English critical and pronouncing dictionary \u2013 Professor William L.

{"eta": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry\n\nMore than just a football game\n\n\u2014 Curtis LeMay, former coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, \"Carlisle\"\n\n\nHey, they're both limping\n\nHey, they're both hurting\n\nWe're all so so hard, yeah....'\n\nBut the football has lost,\n\nBy the way, but I can't believe someone would think\n\nThat was the way it was supposed to go,\n\nThis a sport for losers,\n\nBut the soccer game was so damn good.\"\n\n(where was there a soccer game?)\n\nSome coaches enjoy this. In a competitive team, the only thing more important than scoring the most points in the game is not letting the other team win, generally taking control of the game with play called by their head coach. In practice, this implies that when the other team gets to play all its best players, they will win while the coach in charge of making sure the game is competitive doesn't face the harsh reality of that reality. Generally, this is done to be a means to ensure that the coach doesn't get fired, because of course, competition for the coach doesn't get a lot more honest than running the table. However, some coaches are so enamored of this \"competitive spirit\" that they will take the title of \"World Class\" over the title of a solid player to make sure every single time the other team takes the field they beat them.\n\nThis is usually set up through some form of quasi-fancyy \"coaching (formal) trials\" with outside experts who give them free reign to \"prioritize\" opponents, such as the elderly: Someone like \"Gail Rowley\" who never plays with a shot and who can't get any hobbies, because she is terminally ill: she is trying to make up for all her \"God-awful golf\" (in real life, she is a teacher of physical education, so we don't really know how she'd play golf.) The goal of this form of competition in a football game, though, is to see who the'mighty dogs' are at going between the tackles or getting through a small pass attempt, and nothing else. After their practice session, if they get in another play with a teammate, then we know the coach is making sure that the team doesn't lose. This can be tough, because the players know their special teams are better than the other team, and they know that if that is the case and they are kicked off the team, there will be no one behind the bars. It's probably not fair, but now the player is 'under his coach's rules'. The judge usually shoots the situation down with a \"Judge's prejudice\" response, because judging a person or team on past performance does not do a person an injustice or serve the team well in any way.\n\nAnother reason for letting a team have a litany of new weapons are that sometimes a new weapon will make it harder to beat the team with the old one. This can be demonstrated by a random player who suddenly gets more powerful after players of the old team replace their weapons as a new player steals one. The other reason for changing weapons is that a special weapon that a team has been using in the past, and that has cost them an opponent, now makes it much harder for a current player to get the new weapon. If we know the old weapon cost the team one, we know that the team would probably get a new one as soon as they got one of the new weapons (or they would need more defensive players, or the coach needed more talent, etc.). This also applies when different teams have different abilities, like defensive prowess, speed, toughness, etc.\n\nBy forcing the opponent to give up stuff that is harder to beat, the team can put the opponent in a hard-to-replace state, so that the team becomes more focused and the opponent less motivated to 'beat the crap out of the guy who gets the new weapon'.\n\nThis technique has occasionally been used to avoid a brawl. When given a new weapon, the opponent will \"compete\" to beat the new weapon with the old weapon and sometimes make it to some arena where the new weapon is a nuisance, to which the opponent will drop any hopes of beating the weapon with the old weapon, with the team's slogan \"by the way, we played the football the other day\". Once the new weapon has been used, the opponent will rise and stay and hope for the best. However, if they ignore this adage as they should, the team will \"go back\" to their old weapon that didn't kill them this time. The new weapon is not a guaranteed success. For the same reason, even if an otherwise un-insane player of the same team drops down to low-level expert mode (assuming they didn't", "topp": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry\n\nMore than just a football game\n\n\u2014 Curtis LeMay, former coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, \"Carlisle\"\n\n\nHey, Fab Five, we both remember the Fab Five, don't we?\"\n\nby \"We see, former player [x] (ex-colleague) runs roughshod over Fab Five\"\n\nOne in a million, you call the game and the Fab Five throw the first touchdown, and the other team inevitably gives in and runs backwards the entire rest of the second quarter, taking hits from around the defensive line and forced to have a full minute's rest. The team that catches that record-setting pass had a chance to turn the game into a drag race on a jumbotron, and made things worse for the other team by trying to blitz past them and forcing a turnover in the process. Before long, those two teams are locked in a quasi-Hollywood Dodgeball fight of acrobatic foot-work, deflections and errant passes that are matched only by the speed and skill of the eventual victors. The victor can either get the other team into an Immoral Audience Member situation, or otherwise break through to victory before the second half is over and whichever team scores a touchdown gets to keep it. The Fat Lady may then come out and hammer the frustrated loser before the ref breaks them up.\n\nThis can happen the same way multiple times, using a very similar premise:\n\nWhat we're saying is that at the end of a game, the Fab Five (players, coaches, officials) want to win the game, yet instead of doing what their teammates and opponents have asked them to do (which would be to make the winner more probable to win the game) their superiors are making them fight each other, and abusing them for other reasons.\n\nDepending on the origins of this trope, this could be an on-field brawl in which both teams engaging in it are fighting with one another. This rarely involves throwing cars into the stands or anything remotely formal \u2014 more often, two teams are fighting behind each other, and only lightly injuring one another. More common, the combatants between the teams are artificial, usually small-time, injuries received in some friendly game, which then rile up the competing teams and cause them to escalate the conflict at full throttle. There may also be physical and mental retaliation as one team tries to outplay the other in a game of chess against the other team.\n\nA movie \u2014 no, LOTS \u2014 about this trope is The Big Score. However, as with much of the art form, it's likely that movie makers cast anti-establishment protesters and/or body-language activists for the simple reason that the fight actually looks bad for them. You can accuse them of being Unusual Fansensitive to Pain, for instance, but your audience won't seem to care because it looks like their anger is letting them off the hook. Of course, the audience can accuse the mucky field staff of trying to blacken the image of the badly injured players, or even the overall stadium vibe can start to feel more like an angry mob than a bunch of grateful actors hitting each other with pieces of cloth.\n\nThese are Great Sport; it's a lifelong attempt to ruin your opponents.\n\nSeemingly subverted on electronic sports, where instead of drafting people to throw blows, games take place between virtual opponents, with the goal being to send as many nerve-wracking times as possible as quickly as possible. Often gets an equal mix of gladiatorial spectacle (see Deadshot and other Fast Bullets) and recreational misbehavior that can end up threatening the safety of others involved.\n\nNoticeably Forbidden, if you ask your Ultra-Violence Nemesis, since this sort of scene could be used against them in an emergency. Since calling a fight the \"Nigga-fight\" or the \"Degeneration-Fight\" might be seen as indicating Unethical Conduct. See also Attack of the Bunnies, where two units are on the verge of creating a mutual combat: one team wants to win, the other wants to get in.\n\nOpen from the start, with people clearly in a Few Good Men and some nearly connected with each other (everyone except the Fighting Committee members is 5-6 ft, his limo driver 50+ yo, with a purse that's very fair game, as are several of the BBW characters), the colors of the combatants may be Colorful, which suggests a prehistoric tribal warfare, or Tactical Specialist, which might imply that it was a short-lived affair between members of a professional team (note that the Longhorns in particular may have been part of this, since all the members carry Huey \"Horsey\" Smith's -- otherwise un-known! -- Zulu bandana).

Our enemy is the Navy.\"\n\nIn a perfect world, the various branches of a government (local, regional or central) should be able to cooperate and pull their resources together for the greater good.\n\nThe world is not perfect.\n\nWhen it does not, one of the reasons usually is Interservice Rivalry, where at least two branches of the government don't work well together, sometimes openly opposing and working against each other. Usually if the leaders of said branches know each other, they can't let go of their past feelings and it intensifies the rivalry. Often in military fiction (and in real life as well), some amount of Interservice Rivalry will be encouraged by the higher-ups, to promote a competitive spirit but sometimes it can get out of hand. Sometimes it is even used by a dark Chessmaster leader to maintain control. That way if the army ever rebels against him, he can always call in the navy to fight for him.\n\nOn the other hand, particularly in military-centric works where both services in question are meant to be sympathetic, it's used as a source of humor in the form of personnel of either service making fun of each other, good-naturedly or not.\n\nCases of Interservice Rivalry can cause Jurisdiction Friction and Divided We Fall. Compare Right Hand vs. Left Hand. See also CIA Evil, FBI Good, in cases where direct conflict between the two is depicted. There is also Truth in Television to this.\n\nExamples:\n\nopen/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps in general has had a number of inter-service rivalries, notably with rival interstellar police agencies the L.E.G.I.O.N. and the Darkstars, and (to varying degrees) with the various other Lantern Corps. In the Secret Origin storyline during Geoff Johns' run, it is revealed that Hal Jordan and John Stewart first met on opposite sides of a bar fight \u2014 when Jordan was in the Air Force and Stewart was a Marine. Even before that revelation, the rivalry often came up when Hal and John found themselves working together during Johns' run: John liked to bash Air Force pilots for being undisciplined hotheads (calling the Air Force a \"country club\"), and Hal liked to bash Marines for being idiotic thugs.\n\nDuring a ferocious firefight in The Punisher MAX between Frank Castle (a former Marine Force Recon officer) and Barracuda (who is ex-Army special forces) who had abducted Castle's infant daughter , Castle curses 'Cuda out calling him an \"Army puke\". In the Barracuda miniseries the FBI, NSA, DEA and CIA are all cooperating to find Barracuda before he can restore the flow of drugs from Santa Morricone. Naturally, each agency has its own agenda and will make sure to prevent the others don't interfere with it.\n\n, Castle curses 'Cuda out calling him an \"Army puke\". Nick Fury (a former Army Ranger) is known to make comments pertaining to \"Deck monkeys\" and \"Candy-ass marines\".\n\nDuring Gung-Ho's first appearance in the G.I. Joe comic, Rock'N'Roll was notoriously pissed to have a marine in the team.\n\nThe Shield (an Army Super Soldier) had a series of issues where he teamed up with Magog (a Marine given powers by the predecessors to the New Gods). They spent as much time sniping at each other as punching out the bad guys.\n\nThe Avengers: Captain Marvel (U.S. Air Force veteran Carol Danvers) and Captain America (U.S. Army veteran Steve Rogers) have been shown trading jabs about their respective services.\n\nJay Faerber's Dynamo5 features F.L.A.G. (the Foundation for Law and Government), which is responsible for superhero activity in the United States. Robert Kirkman's Invincible features the G.D.A.

They don't get on too well.\n\nKobra attempted a variant by pitting Checkmate, the Suicide Squad, the Force of July, and Project Captain Atom against each other, abducting key personnel and bombing their bases in ways that cast suspicion on the others, so he can fire his microwave cannon unmolested.

If not, we will continue to be enemies. - Huang Xiao Long I worked hard enough as a teacher. I had done the best I could, and it ended so harshly... I had to stay up all night and wail in the snow to make ends meet. But maybe I wasn't a bad student after all. - Taichi Kui\n\nThe Next Day [Asahi's Notes 4]\n\nScrim, tomorrow at 1:30 pm, Tai and I will do a teaming of 9 on a challenge of unknown substance that was written on the other side of the \"wheel\". That's the contest entry that I gave Tai for Tai's last memory. It took a few seconds to do, but Tai executed it very well in the end. That was a weird way to celebrate, but I did it. - Kiku Kui\n\nDay 15 [Tai's Day 16]\n\nAT 0501 Tai was coming back from the hospital, and he's now in jail. After my mother died, I took my aunt and uncle to the hospital to make sure I was fine. Everything is fine, except I'm super hungover, and they're both staring at me like I'm about to do something horrible to them. Uu~ Well, if you're doubting me that's fine, too. Anyway, at the hospital, my aunt and uncle treated me like a third in my family. I even met Mama Miki at the hospital. For anyone to be so friendly and help out so much. It really helps me feel more at home, which I was feeling for a while now, thanks to them. I still don't feel comfortable being one to two to three times more than myself, even if I act like a normal person. But now that I'm playing as well as I am, it would be nice to have someone's personal protection to myself. So I told Miki to take care of me. Miki's still embarrassed that I took her by surprise at the hospital. So we went back to where I'd first met Mom. And I stayed with my aunt and uncle for a while. Even I don't know why I did that, I guess I was afraid. I guess I was a little. So after I was with them for a while my aunt told me she was going to be off today too. So she said that this will be a break, and we'll see each other again when I get back. - Taichi Kui\n\nDay 16 [Tai's Day 17]\n\nOn my way home earlier, I noticed a particular situation. I had to decide whether to help the family that's being threatened by bandits, or to protect the people I'm trying to keep sane. If I didn't make the right decision, then I'd pay for it with my life. I'm never going to see my family again. So it was always my job to take care of Tai and Eiko. Now if I take care of Eiko, I might see my family again. Well, it's like that. At first I was busy fighting the bandits, and now I'm getting in the way. I can't accept it. At what point in your life do you decide that it's pointless? - Tai I wonder when did people start taking their own lives for no reason, then? Because that's what's happened today. Because we both tried to help the people we thought were dear to us, but we could have failed. Because we're in the midst of something truly important. We have so much on our plate, and we could have taught each other and kept in contact. But the guilt that Tai's finger shows us is enough to convince me not to do that again. There's no possibility of ending it, because I have to protect all of us. - Taichi Kui\n\nDay 17 [Tai's Day 18]\n\nOn my way home earlier, I happened upon some red roads. I know this because I tried that already on my own. But sometimes when I'm driving, I can't look where I'm going. So I took them, thinking that I wasn't going to die in the process, but then I noticed that the roads weren't smooth. I saw the lights of our village flashing up in front of me as they passed.

Today we hope to teach each other that.

And right now, she's the top queen. Because of the difficulty of the challenges, this tournament will only be halted once. Next best is Hao Xiao-Long, but I have no fears of stepping into the shadows. To be honest, we haven't stepped into the shadows yet either. With the kinds of things we can do now...when time allows, we'll be able to pass on all the knowledge we've acquired.\n\nShan Shao's Diary Day 16 - Last Stand [Lunar Goddess Heart] That was a weird dream! Vague memories seemed to follow. But what I do know is that in the dream, we experienced a cold, weaponized replica of Taipei City. Everything was covered in a broken-off part, and flames covered the floor. In the fire, I saw a map of the city, with the Mansion, with the cities that are still being created. The Fire Goddess revealed herself to me, even though the impression of her being old faded away.\n\nShan Shao's Diary Day 17 - Metamorphosis [Time steps into full (if Hao has 800 points), busybody competition time, third in the tournament] I woke up from the dream, and Hao was not in my room. He was on the TV. When I looked down, he was yelling, \"Why do you stay awake?\" When he went into the TV, he checked the three contestants in one place. Five of them were total each, even if I had fallen in the pile. All of them had zero points. Now that I look at it, this was not their fault. The trophy will never go to them. But since they're so weak, it won't be enough to keep them from us. In the crowd, Wan, Huang... were right behind me. But they didn't see anything. All I saw was two lonely faces. I pulled out my phone, took a screenshot, and then punched the screen. Who are these two? I looked. It was Henyun and Gil...I remembered them. They're both from the Qiao family. In the past, they both worked for the Fortune site, but their boss was dead. The graveyard they went back to, they didn't see. Perhaps...the tomb of the dead had its own spirit. Then why were those five here? Because that is the Mystery Box of the Sun Goddess, and that makes you the heir of the Fortune chest. You can't let them lose.\n\nShan Shao's Diary Day 18 - Embrace [Appearance change] I was still a lowlife punk. Then the face of a clueless flower girl appeared...

Always beautiful.\n\nShan Shao's Diary Day 19 - Reception [Offerings made] Tabe wanted to introduce me to the other two, the females in the Sacred Treasure organization. I told them I can't tell what they saw, but I brought everyone together and told them that Tabe sent a message. To the Department Bureau, we should return as soon as possible. We have unfinished business. No matter what we decide, things are going to continue with two levels. After that, we can probably travel together.\n\nShan Shao's Diary Day 20 - So Easy [Weekend free time] Today I went to the City Hall, where my CEO was present. All the traffic inside was recorded, and I got information about a location on the map. The map told me that it's the Embassy, so I wanted to go there right away. Then before we had a chance to pick one of the restaurants, an employee abruptly ran away. I was forced to replace him.\n\nShan Shao's Diary Day 21 - Break Time [Work] Today was once again a weekend, but the secretaries all complained about Kui-san, who arrived late.

Today, our entire team watched the games in Group B, hoping they would be able to make it into the top 8.\n\n\nLooking over our experience in Paris, the number of things Chinese teams need to reevaluate and improve are a lot. There's a lot of deep seeded problems and we're thinking about them constantly. We can't be too disappointed by this experience here. It's not that we don't have the strength or capabilities--it's because we've fallen in our training outside of the stage!\n\n\nIn Group D--LGD's opponents KT, OG, TSM shouldn't be able to defeat LGD. But why did they go 0-4? After the group stages were over, we talked to LGD a couple times. They said to us, \"We don't know why our opponents know so much about our strategies. We felt like our picks during scrims and weaknesses were all exposed. Whatever we did, we kept losing.\"\n\n\nIn Group B--for me, no one should've been able to beat IG. But why did they end up having such a gloomy end? It could be said their strategies ended up not being a secret.\n\n\nPlaying at Worlds isn't easy and it's even more difficult to adjust your players' state of mind. EDG didn't do this well either. We depended on our foundation and our luck picking the groups to make it into the top 8. The second thing is gathering information about our opponents. Once you learn about them in scrims, then you receive a key advantage over them. The third thing is every team in the world right now depends on how motivated their team is. The age of depending on a few key players to carry is over.\n\n\nAfter the first group ended, I chatted with IG and LGD's managers and team members. To be honest, we weren't just chatting. We were taking about why they decided they would practice and scrim this way, leading to a very passive performance on stage.\n\n\nThese kind of games depend on teamwork. Korea's teams basically won't train with outside teams--they'll only train a little bit with outside teams. EU/NA teams scrimmed with each other and it seemed as if only Chinese teams didn't want to make appointments to scrim. According to our plans, we hoped that 60-70% of our scrims could go to LPL teams.\n\n\nBut even IG and LGD were worried about bumping into us during the bracket stage. What could we do? They decided to decline our scrims. On our first day, we had an empty time slot and we tried to arrange scrims because we knew there was a lot to prepare for during the group stages. Every team was shooting stuff that day and doing interviews and fan meets. We had conflicting schedules and we also needed to figure out the play styles for the teams in our group.\n\n\nAfter thinking it over, the coach ran over to each team's practice room, asking if they had time to scrim. If you go too late, the team you want might already have a scrim lined up for that time. At the same time, we had to have one coach in the room to wait for other teams to come schedule scrims with us. This was the most important part of our preparations. We took our empty slot for scrims and approached IG and LGD's practice rooms.\n\n\nThey returned very quickly. They were free for one time slot, but we weren't able to get it. We understood why, but we felt helpless. IG and LGD seemed like they were hit hard. It was hard for them to win a single game.\n\n\nLet me tell you a few details. Korean teams were also helping them contact a good Korean food place. We also had Korean players and we went to ask for some contact details for Korean food. They didn't give us any information. But everyone reading this--please don't assume any hostility between the two of us. Even though it's a competition, we're still have a good relationship with each other.\n\n\nAfter I expressed my viewpoint, they felt like our tactics in the beginning was a mistake. We should've practiced a lot more. They also scolded me--why didn't you tell us earlier? But from my point of view, it wasn't easy for me to say aloud. Every team has their own way of training; that doesn't mean my way of thinking is right. I hoped they could use their own way to produce good results.\n\n\nSomething happened today with the casters. It's something that made the players and their management incredibly angry.

It features four \u00b4tension\u00b4 switches:\n\n\u00b4Tension\u00b4 is the amount of backlash in the line of oscillators' power/balance curves. The \"Tension\" switch does not change the balance of the oscillators, it just adjusts the output phase.\n\n\u00b4Temp\u00b4 mode is the inverse of the mode diagram (Figure 3) from the Amplitude Database, the difference is the \"crossover\" between the point where it was \"neutral\", and the point where it is \"foil\"\n\n\u00b4Threshold\u00b4 mode is the inverse of the mode diagram, the difference in voltages between the two ranges.\n\n\u00b4Bass frequency\u00b4 mode controls the output phase of the Bass horn\u00b4s triangle (the two coils inside the horn have the same power and phase as the first two coils). This is intended to \"fold\" the triangle, which makes it louder.\n\nThis \"active\" passive unit consists of the above passive oscillators and six audio-inputs: one for each of them\u00b4s respective \"gain\" circuit. These are used to vary the levels of each horn\u00b4s preamp\ufffds volume and to change the upper frequency range. The omnidirectional tone control allows direct gain control of any horn that is positive with the amplifiers, and allows direct control of the outputs for any horn that is negative with the amplifiers. This is an extremely powerful and versatile tone control toolbox.\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nFigure 4: Here the typical \"overturning\" planar horn is brought close to the panel.

It works on any 2-octave or higher equalizer, with more sophisticated settings than the PN-481, or the Zoom 647. It can be used to 'correct' distortions of fanned input signals, as well as smoothing feedback. It can be a very powerful eqi gator for mono, stereo or rear channel signal processing, where each horn\u00b4s frequency range is varied. The manual will tell you how to prepare the filter for your unit. This is one of the many well-known mainstream receivers (the Nestea PN-481 from 1981 is very similar) which are also similar in sound-quality to the Zoom 647 (Djox Phase 2 and Matrix 912 are also good). For bass, the 477-WRX would be the best choice. For op-amps it can boost output - you\u00b4ll want to keep the OpAmp tuner passive in order to minimize the overall distortion. For mid/high sensitivity applications or mid-range matching on-board it is the perfect choice. It\u00b4s the standard range of the Xwave joystick, but you might find it was a little too sensitive on some outputs. For ring modulating inputs it should be adjusted with the DPAQ or Traktor modulator. The 477-WRX also offers a dedicated \"Filter\" button as well, though, in my opinion the best use for the filter button is with the ''Layering...\u300d effect. When applied after the \"Filter\" control, this will simply free up the gate supply and the output from the tone-hurt outputs can be turned into the sound of the modulator. Zoom normally uses the CW filter as its main filter, but the operator-processor of the Z series can achieve nonlinear characteristics. The effect with the filter buttons is fine for the mixed-range CQs (see Figure 8), but not for the...\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nFigure 5: For some of the lines in Figure 7, the Z series of receivers was designed with one that\u00b4s lower on the menu, and the lower output level we can try to reach\n\nWhile the 477-WRX has a sound that feels right (more-than-standard maybe), or even being at least a pretty good comp for some circuit-only applications.

Bass only requires a standard Whammy 2 wah for each pickup. Furthermore, even the cheapest single-ended designer will support the Rode NT3s' common octave octave guitar boost, making it likely the amp can be run as both a nearly constant mono boost and an octave bass boost on equalisation. Finally, the Honeysville NOS filters \u2014 pre-overdriven, it should be noted \u2014 are also comprised of a certain level of pre-amps, which make it possible to use more common line inputs than those on rival designs.\n\n\nPower Supply\n\n\nThe power supply is our leader's only major complaint, though. 'Bout it, I think DAB clearly nailed its design element and certain core components just didn't feel sturdy enough.

This can also be used to dynamically control the effects loop level.\n\n\nExcite: Controls the amount or strength of excitation, from none to extreme. All three exciters are controlled by this single knob. With all exciters turned off, this knob adds resonance to the crossover filter.\n\n\nX-Over: Controls the crossover frequency of the band-split filter, separating the low and high signal paths. Covers the range 100 Hz to 600 Hz.\n\n\nClean: Controls the level of the clean signal.\n\n\nLow: Controls the level of the low frequencies, which are passed to the output without further processing.\n\n\nHi/Loop: Controls the level of the high frequencies, which are processed by the exciter and optionally routed through the external effects loop.\n\n\nExciters\n\n\nGrowl: A distortion-like exciter which generates extra harmonics. Unlike conventional distortion, this effect preserves playing dynamics exactly, rather than adding compression. This effect is great for adding harmonics before filters and phasers, particularly with bass/string combinations that have a dark tone with few harmonics.\n\n\nHarm: Generates octave-up harmonies.

People keep asking me what it is. Here is an explanation of PLH with some spiritual implications.\n\nWhat is The Sinner?\n\nThe Sinner is all that has wrong-doing and a disposition toward evil. He has had an experience in which he went astray and then later regretted that he had done it. But there is a sense in which it will be accepted into a way of life which was not important to him in the first place. If this kind of unskillfulness is accepted by both the Christian and the non-Christian, and then they become one body, it will not be changed by changing something else. It remains the same and no deep change will take place.\n\nWho are these spirits which were in the soul when the God of Love came into the world? Who are these other spirits which, in time, have become we can see such voices and feeling in the souls of men and which sing the everlasting praises of God? In all truth, it must be God that you talk about. They are God's children in the archangelic way, only they are in another world. They have taken part in the drama, are in another body. Therefore they bear witness, and they must be studied. (p.333)\n\nNotice the word \"sons\" and the \"sons\" are ordinary boys.\n\nThe Sinner and the Cross:\n\nIt has been taught, and the pattern has been understood everywhere, that the final, bitter conflict with the devils is waged by Lucifer. But that life to which Lucifer ascends during the final hour is different from the one in which the first and subpersonal series of the archangels have lived. Before and after the rivalry and struggle with Adam and Eve, angels were angels, and for that reason were fit for such a life. But when these archangels, with Lucifer and his brothers, enter the life of physical man, they have become men. (pp.333-4)\n\nThe \"going astray\" was real, but the \"renouncing\" was a mistake.\n\nA human being whom all men love, many who have fallen into the sins of their youthful sinfulness, should in every respect be raised to surpass them and become, like them, a gift of Jesus Christ. Like Adam and Eve, in their young, innocent state, these young souls' minds have been never changed, nor, for that matter, do their wills never change. And as early as this period, as Christians, the great differences in the souls of Christians and of sinners find expression in the simplest of spiritual realities. There is a fundamental difference between the conceptions of beauty and of glory of man that is distinctive to those of spirits and to man. (p.334)\n\nThe fight with Adam and Eve\n\nIn chapter 8, verse 50, Phlegyas states that when the archangels and the spirits of darkness joined hands to defeat the youth, the duel ended with great carnage, and Cain was named the victor. Still, the students in our school, realize that it is the archangels that wage the battle with man in the final conflict, and that not Cain.\n\nAdam leaves the mortal world with his righteous children, and in the new world in which he came into it, there still were male and female on the earth, and in the body he found, like Adam, a woman in the womb of the circle. With the light and power of Jesus Christ he's given birth to a beautiful virgin, beautiful, and to every boy and girl the choices are being made for its and its to lead it to the kingdom of God. Yet after the thought \"Adam has done and has retired into an abode where there's no tension at all\" the heart of man is divided, thinking \"Adam is going away into the danger zone,\" and the spirit of darkness asks \"Are you a good man or not?\" and all Adam feels is shame that he would have done that thing in the name of God that was in the name of God's law. Although the spirit of darkness is not all-devout and foolish, the obstacle is evident\u2014he needed all-devout and foolishness so that he could have accepted God's government.\n\nWhen the deluded archangel tells him of having a daughter in Eden, the young man rejects the angel. Now the heart of Adam is divided and thought the spirit of darkness has joined with the wickedest. He, a man of reason and a free agent, rejects both. \"The burden,\" says the archangel, \"that was heavy was taken away.\" The storm is now at an end, and God's children are united in the bond of immortal love with the youth, \"and ye make a friendship in the midst of the storm\" (verse 52).\n\nThe message of the verse is clear. (This passage", "human": "PLH- what it is and what it does.\n\nI have been preaching PLH here on DGCR. People keep asking me what it is. Here is an explanation.\n\n\nThis is a picture that Anakha posted on DGR along time ago.\n\nYou see the thin horizontal line in the middle of the discs? That's the P arting L ine H eight (PLH). The parting line is the thin line of plastic that is accidentally left on the disc after it has been injection molded. It is accidental because ideally the molds will be machined with high enough tolerance that there will be no witness of where the mold separates. But in the real world, wear and tear will slightly round the edges of the mold halves. Plastic flows into the rounded off sections and voila! You have a visible parting line.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I hear you but... so what?\"\n\nWell... assuming the 2 discs in the picture above came from the exact same mold , the PLH will dictate how overstable the disc will be. Well, that's the extremely simplified way of stating it but that statement still holds up well in practice. I underlined \"the exact same mold\" because this is very important. No, San Marino Rocs and Rancho Rocs are not the same mold.\n\n\nTake 2 Wizards. Put them nose to nose. The one with the higher PLH will be more overstable. Even if one is E plastic and one is SSS. If both discs pictured above were Wizards (they're not, one is last year's Ace Race putter), then the yellow disc on the right would be more overstable. That's all there is to it.\n\nTake 2 Bosses and put them nose to nose similar to the putters in the picture. The one with the higher PLH will be more overstable than the one with the lower PLH. I have a Champ Boss and an R-Pro Boss. The PLH is almost 1/8th inch higher on the Champ; guess which is more overstable? Yes, there is a big difference between the weights. But the difference would still be huge if they weighed the same. Even with the 25 gram weight difference, if the lighter R-Pro had a higher PLH it would be more overstable than the Champ. It might not ACT as overstable because you could more easily reach the designed cruising speed of the disc. It is easier to accelerate a 1 pound object to 50 mph than a 20 pound object. Given the identical speed and spin between the 2 Bosses, the lighter disc but higher PLH would be more overstable.\n\nBecause of the discs geometry, the PLH will have a larger range of shift on discs with wider wings. This is commonly recognized. Flashes are known for wild inconsistency. Forces vary, Bosses vary, Katanas vary. Even Leopards (relatively thin rimmed driver) will have stablility variations but because the PLH can't shift as much the variations won't be as extreme. This is why Cyclones, GZs, TBs, EXs, XLs, etc. are \"more consistant\" from run to run when compared to Bosses.\n\n\n\"Okay, that's all fine and good but what practical application does this have for me?\"\n\nYou can save money. Ever go to the store to buy a backup Boss? It might not fly at all how you wanted it to. Too overstable, too understable whatever. It is tough to do with beat discs but you can try to match your thrower's PLH to a new discc's PLH. It is better to take a measurement before you ever throw that disc. Yeah it's pretty nerdly but it would save money.\n\nAlso you can use this technique to pick out specific variations. The first time I bought a Roadrunner I knew I wanted most of the typical RR characteristics but I didn't want a really flippy one. I bought the highest PLH that PIAS had and I'm happy with it. I bought another one online and it is too flippy. The PLH is significantly lower. Not 1/8th of an inch like the Bosses, but every little fraction of a millimeter makes an appreciable difference.\n\n\nSo, to sum up (and I know you are sick of hearing this by now)...\n\nTHE HIGHER THE PLH, THE MORE OVERSTABLE THE DISC.\n\nTHE LOWER THE PLH, THE LESS OVERSTABLE THE DISC.\n\nBut they have to be the same mold.\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry for any misspellings, I didn't proofread.

It was constructed on 18 June 1793 and completed 22 February 1809 (the second bridge of the Paris central railway line). It was first connected to the new railway bridge, under the name of the Temple Bridge, by railway stations of Paris in 1896. The Paris Tower is the first bridge in Europe, built in 1902. The Castrum Pura was constructed in 1904. In France, both the Maison de la Paix and the Petites-Rivi\u00e8res are now the tallest bridges. A bridge over the Channel that gives access to the interior of the P\u00e9rigord is built later. In France, the bridge between Canal-Fontenay and the P\u00e9rigord Canal is the oldest bridge in Europe. The bridge between the Peine-D\u00e8sar and the Petite-D\u00e8sar is also the oldest bridge in France and in Europe.\n\n1. The technology\n\nIn 1874, Paris was the capital of the Republic of Belgium. They needed a new road-bridge. It was important, as it linked the Dordogne and the Pyrenees. This bridge was the first built in the French railways (which had not been built). Construction was led by Victor I. Collard. The length of the tunnel was 68 metres and the width was 22 metres, which was due to the necessity of passing the sea. The pressure of water acted on the steel alloy. The bridge was 180 metres long, and was built over 8.6 hectares. The bridge was finally opened after 63 years of work, on 14 May 1918. It was supported by 130 bridge trucks, weighing 14,000 tons, and 758 bridges, weighing 600 tons.\n\nDuring this period of time, the bridge also underwent a water lapping event, and was protected from earthquakes with concrete blocks placed on its base to hold water. This bridge is one of the most photographed. The bridge was actually ten stories high. Collard designed an unusually high bridge, but it was also very pedestrian friendly. The reason is that it was designed with great consideration for foot passengers. The bridge made its crossing an occasion to 'gaze at beauty'.\n\n2. The human subject\n\nThe tramway network was covered with pedestrians, now with buses. The pedestrian crossings of the Paris Avenue (XIX Ave) between the H\u00f4tel du Cap and the Pont du Lac had all been covered with flashing lights for many decades, until only then in 1979 as a response to traffic accidents in Paris. The new Bollore-Maison Du Cap bridge also runs along these paved pedestrian routes.\n\nOn the Pont du Lac, the bridge at Pont de la Garde was named \"Maison du Garde\" after Marcel-Olivier 'Jean-Charles' Guermont d'Auvergne in 1859. The old bridge has been named \"Maison du Garde\". Both bridges were designed by Charles-Jean-Auguste Bailly. Both bridges are used on an average by over 20 million people per year.\n\n3. The National Museum of Applied Art\n\nWe bring a major attraction in the works\n\nThe National Museum of Applied Art (NMA) gives one of France's finest collections of architectural objects from the whole of Europe and, above all, from the European metropolis. The collection is famous for its reproductions of classical/classic artworks as their originals. It also looks at the contrasts in techniques between the classical and the modern: how they differ from one another \u2013 for example, from the side versus the front. The paintings from the MFA show a strong influence of the Matisse period. The work by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is particularly representative of this. The Mona Lisa was made by Ren\u00e9 Magritte and the Etruscan American Women were made by Seurat. But besides the classical collections, the NMA also possesses a tremendous collection of sculpture, painting, and photography. On the occasion of the centenary of the opening of the museum, in a public event, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Eduard Prat, Jean de Toulouse-Lautrec and Joseph Vollard opened the exhibitions titled 'Nom du Monde' and 'Brabant, 1872'. The NMA is not only a place for collecting and art, as it also provides a place for changing cultural identity of Paris.\n\n3.

The daguerreotype was taken in Paris by Louis Daguerre (1787\u20131851), on a date that has been calculated as between 24 April and 4 May 1838. It is of a busy street, but because exposure time was over ten minutes, the city traffic was moving too much to appear. The exception is a man in the bottom left corner, who stood still getting his boots polished long enough to show. Less discernible, but also visible, is the boot black. As Geoffrey Batchen has noted, this is therefore also the first photo to illustrate both labour and class difference. See also Jenkins, who notes the possibility that there are one or two other people also discernible. Daguerre gave a triptych of daguerreotypes, of which this was one (with another of the same view, taken later in the day), to King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and they were displayed at the Arts Association in Munich from 20 October 1839. Eventually they came into the custody of the Fotomuseum in Munich, where in the 1970s an attempt at cleaning succeeded in erasing the images. The image as seen today is a reproduction of a photographic copy made by Beaumont Newhall, the historian of photography, in 1937. [History of Art: History of Photography] NB Although the strongest evidence supports this image, an interesting case has been made for a daguerreotype image made by Daguerre and Mathurin-Joseph Fordos, of the Pont Neuf in Paris, and now preserved in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers. It's argued that this could actually date from the summer of 1837, but at any event prior to the Boulevard du Temple image. See Gunthert, or the same page translated.\n\nFirst portrait photo of a person\n\nAccording to John Johnson (1813\u20131871), the first daguerreotype portrait was of himself, made in New York by Alexander S. Wolcott (1804\u20131844) on 6 or 7 October 1839. This was tiny, and has not survived. (Hannavy) However, Howard R. McManus has convincingly argued that John William Draper (1811\u20131882), professor of chemistry at the University of New York, accomplished successful portrait daguerreotypes as early as 23 September 1839, the first such being of his assistant William Henry Goode, taken in the university chapel. (McManus\u2014First) Draper's daguerreotype of Goode is said to have still been in existence in 1890. (Eder) McManus includes an image of a flawed daguerreotype plate (from his own collection), in which the subject is very difficult to make out, but which he speculates may in fact be an experimental portrait photograph of William Henry Goode, from 22 or 23 September 1839. Generally accepted as the earliest surviving photographic portrait image of a human ever produced is the approximately quarter plate daguerreotype by Robert Cornelius [1809\u20131893], a head-and-shoulders [self-]portrait, facing front, with arms crossed (above), dating from 1839 [Oct. or Nov.]. [LC-USZC4-5001 DLC]. Written on the paper backing is \"The first light picture ever taken. 1839.\" The photograph, now at the Library of Congress in Washington DC, was taken outside his place of business on 8th Street between Market and Chestnut, in Philadelphia. The Cornelius daguerreotype is not uncontested as the earliest surviving photographic portrait. Another strong contender is the self-portrait of the Baltimore daguerreotypist Henry Fitz (1808\u20131863), now held by the Smithsonian, which also dates from late 1839. This is reproduced in Newhall, and in Wikimedia Commons. NB An interesting argument has been made for an earlier candidate than any of these, a daguerreotype portrait of a M. Huet, apparently by Daguerre himself, and dated 1837 on the back. This image is in the collection of Marc Pagneux. It does seem established that Daguerre was experimenting with portraits in 1837, and the portrait could be one such. See Gunthert, or the same page translated; and Gunthert & Roquencourt, (translated); and Wood.\n\nFirst photo, and first portrait photo, of a woman\n\nIn 1855 the photographer Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791\u20131872) claimed that he had taken full-length portrait daguerreotypes of his daughter, and also photographs of her in groups with some of her young friends, in September or the beginning", "eta_suffix": "Rivi\u00e8res\n\nPublic investment and an export of scientific and industrial knowledge\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the project 'Paris 2075', which considered the renewal of Paris from above, was taken up by the UNESCO.

While Hawlucha is tiny compared to many other Pok\u00e9mon, its speed makes it one of the fastest Pok\u00e9mon, so consider it on the lookout for enemies just out of reach. At level 25...This Pok\u00e9mon gains more power at the expense of speed, due to the four different elements. PAL : It can generate thunderstorms, and as such, it can hit anyone who gets too close, with its super strong voice that it can use to keep people at a distance. Since its weather-based powers make it extremely effective at citywide attacks, but it has quite a sluggish speed, so take note.\n\n: It can generate thunderstorms, and as such, it can hit anyone who gets too close, with its super strong voice that it can use to keep people at a distance.

It was used to battle and defeat Team Rocket's Lugia and Lugia in the Emerald Forest. Hawlucha also battled against Bayonetta in the Oceanfront Resort's Battle Factory but was defeated. It is later seen competing in the Lumiose Conference alongside its Trainer, Satoshi, and Ash and N is instrumental in their battle and a Wartortle attacks Bayonetta.\n\nIn Castaway, Hawlucha briefly attends an Ash & Pikachu snorkeling trip. It was later seen at the Seafloor Cavern when the trio is trying to impress Ash with their expertise in Water-type Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nCory's Hawlucha debuted in A Quick and Dirty Rescue!. He is already an expert with Water Pok\u00e9mon, but nonetheless was still unable to shake Satoshi off of his off. After Team Rocket launches a giant sandstorm, Hawlucha along with his older siblings are attacked by a Tentacool. Hawlucha quickly ducked under the sandstorm and assisted in picking up the fleeing Feebas. The three soon leave with Feebas and arrive at the Seafloor Cavern. There, they are greeted by Pikachu, who was enjoying an hour of underwater training.\n\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters manga\n\nSapphire used her Hawlucha in Just the Spear!? to battle against the Tauros's foe Tyrantrum. Later, he encountered Team Rocket's Tauros and her Hawlucha, the two of which were being chased by the two wild swimmers. Misty attempted to catch one of them, but Hawlucha evaded her sticky grasp. Later, Hawlucha fought with Eggiyo, but Ash won, as Hawlucha quickly ran away, so she could catch the fleeing Tauros. Later, Sapphire used Hawlucha to battle against the Tauros's Tauros for a rematch, using Eggiyo to capture the wild Tauros.\n\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters manga\n\nSapphire used Hawlucha in A Name With a Sound in Pocket Monsters BW: The Heroes of Fire and Thunder when she attacked Clefairy, Eevee, and Flareon with its ice core. She then used Hawlucha to battle Butterfree, but unlike her other Pok\u00e9mon, Hawlucha was frozen solid.

Hawlucha gained this title after defeating the previous champion, a Machamp. After developing a rivalry with Hawlucha, Machamp retreated to some mountains so that it could train to become stronger.\n\nHawlucha made his first appearance in The Forest Champion!, where he battled an Ursaring that stole food from a group of Pok\u00e9mon. Although he easily got the upper hand, Hawlucha missed his attempt to finish Ursaring off with Flying Press, leaving him open to attack. Ursaring was stopped by Ash and Pikachu, who scared him off. Ash offered to help Hawlucha perfect Flying Press, which eventually ended in success after countless failed attempts. They are interrupted by the Ursaring from before, who teamed up with a Conkeldurr so that they could trick the previous champion, Machamp, into believing that Hawlucha was the one terrorizing the forest Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nHawlucha and Ash\n\nMachamp challenged Hawlucha to battle, and despite Hawlucha's power, it managed to easily take Hawlucha's attacks. Ursaring and Conkeldurr then stepped in and began double-teaming Hawlucha. Although reluctant at first, Machamp realized who the real villain was and defeated Ursaring and Conkeldurr. Machamp carried the two away and said its goodbyes to Hawlucha. Later, Ash challenged Hawlucha to battle with the condition that if he wins, Hawlucha will join his team. Despite the speed of Ash's Froakie, he was easily able to outmaneuver it, avoiding its Water Pulse and Bubble attacks; despite this, the battle ended in a tie when Froakie's Pound collided with his Flying Press. Although Hawlucha didn't lose the battle, he decided to join Ash's team, even agreeing to reinstate Machamp as the forest champion.\n\nIn Battles in the Sky!, Hawlucha was used in a Sky Battle against Moria's Talonflame. Hawlucha was quickly outmatched due to Flying Press being ineffective and Talonflame easily dodging all of Hawlucha's attacks due to being in the air. Hawlucha was defeated after missing with his Karate Chop and being hit by Fire Blast and Steel Wing attacks.\n\nIn Forging Forest Friendships!, Hawlucha battled together with Ash's Froakie against Clemont's Bunnelby and Chespin. Hawlucha used Karate Chop a few times to counter Bunnelby's Double Slap. But, when Bunnelby was going to use Mud Shot and Ash commanded Hawlucha to use Karate Chop again, Froakie used Water Pulse before he could do anything. Hawlucha started to get a little bit angry, but the battle continued. Then Froakie lets Chespin's Pin Missile hit Bunnelby, which faints, making Hawlucha very angry. Hawlucha attacked Froakie, who defended itself. Later, Ash came up with a great new move called Super Flying Cut. They trained but it didn't work out, until Ash was kidnapped by a wild Trevenant. Hawlucha and Froakie pursued Trevenant, finding out that it only wanted help for its friends trapped by Team Rocket. Ash's two Pok\u00e9mon have a battle against Team Rocket, sending them blasting off with their new Super Flying Cut, before giving each other's fist as a sign of their new friendship.\n\nIn Showdown at the Shalour Gym!, Hawlucha was used in his first Gym battle against Korrina as his first Pok\u00e9mon in his Shalour Gym battle. Fighting against Mienfoo, Hawlucha followed Ash's dancing strategy he learned from Tierno. Hawlucha tried to dodge Mienfoo's attacks using this new strategy, but his moves were ill-timed, causing him to take a lot of damage from Korrina's Pok\u00e9mon. This confused Ash, as Tierno's Squirtle could block attacks easily. Hawlucha then went for a Flying Press but it was countered by Swift. At this point, Ash realized he couldn't win by imitating Tierno and that he had to use his own rhythm, so he changed back to his own battle style. Mienfoo went for a High Jump Kick, but Ash had Hawlucha wait and dodge at the last second, causing recoil damage. Hawlucha then attacked with Karate Chop, dodged Mienfoo's Force Palm, and then defeated Mienfoo with Flying Press. He was then recalled. Later Hawlucha was then sent out to battle Korrina's Mega Luc", "eta_suffix": " 150 - 198 280 - 374 Attack : 95 90 - 161 175 - 317 Defense : 75 72 - 139 139 - 273 Sp.Atk : 25 27 - 84 40 - 152 Sp.Def : 95 90 - 161 175 - 317 Speed : 25 27 - 84 40 - 152 Total: 365 Other Pok\u00e9mon with this total Minimum stats are calculated with 0", "topp_suffix": " inside is fun and games.

{"eta": "Oral Ulceration and Chronic Ulcerative Paradental Stomatitis in Dogs\n\nOral ulceration and chronic ulcerative paradental stomatitis (PUR) in dogs has been described by Thompson et al (1991b). The disease is characterized by dental growth and malocclusion. The term SUR is meant to differentiate it from ulcerative arthritis and inflammatory arthritis, both of which do not produce loss of tooth pulp. SUR is a rare and clinically insignificant inflammatory condition in dogs. Surgeon general Aislin A. Weil classified SUR as a discrete entity similar to vasculitis, but less severe, and defined a clinical range from inflammatory arthritis to hypoarthritis.\n\nThis pathologic condition usually progresses without papillary atrophy. As noted earlier, there are no reports in cats or dogs of SUR.\n\nMany dogs suffer from tooth loss at the front teeth (ventral) but do not show any other signs of tooth loss, which most owners mistakenly attribute to inflammation of the margins. When soft tissue growth near the tip reaches the overgrowth at the front teeth, the onset of purulent hyperkeratotic plaque and/or necrotic or coarctation of teeth is indicated. The veterinarian may treat any dental syndrome with corticosteroids and inject local anesthetic.\n\nHistologic findings include tooth longitudinal and tooth-fat layer, incongruously elevated surfactant sialylated mineral deposits, and sparse thyroid follicular cells (TCs). Most dogs with SUR do not complain of systemic symptoms, despite the preponderance of typical thyroiditis. Cytokines in serum indicate that the tumor is malignant but no tumor tissue or nodules or metastases of the tumor are present. Surgery and radiotherapy are generally indicated if a surgical resection is needed. The neurologistic secondary form of a flap is occasionally involved.\n\nScreening and preventive measures\n\nScreening\n\nPatients with SUR are particularly sensitive to global exogenous hormones and should be evaluated for thyroid disease at the start of the screening. Dogs with obvious signs of thyroid disease at screening were invariably tested within 6 months. That is, the procedure should be performed in those dogs that may show a secondary tumor (eg, a splenectomy or mastectomy), and it should be done if they are 17 to 22 months of age.\n\n\nIncreasing evidence of these anti-thyroid agents includes the development of systemic histological changes such as malignant cell infiltration, rise in serum thyroid hormone levels, and thyroid enlargement (ATU). Individuals with severe thyroid disease should be placed on thyroid-promoting drugs. Screening should be repeated (every 3 to 6 months) for a 4-year period.\n\nCalibration of the screening test\n\nDifferential diagnosis of SUR may require attention to the diagnosis of systemic hypothyroidism, either within or outside the intraoral space at the vertex and on the tip of the crown where tumor tissue exists. Clinically, these complications are mostly variable in severity. However, the sarcomas themselves or nodules arising in the crown (which sometimes remain until radical surgery) may have intrinsic endoscopic features such as from hypertrophy of the root. [2] In the cases where the crown is removed, two potentially important questions arise: First, is hypothyroidism also involved? And secondly, do the patients with similar clinical features who received lopinavir/ritonavir/ritonavir/ethazine/etc (ie, complete hypothyroidism) have the same clinical features? It is important to evaluate this question since thyroid surgery is the standard treatment in most dogs with this tumor. There have been case reports of hypothyroidism within the tumor area, though they were all without thyroid disease. Given that the majority of dogs with this condition should not have chronic thyroid. [3]\n\nAntibiotics are recommended if an emetic, soxarone, or anti-thyroid agent is not available. Antibiotics provide a certain degree of control over bacteria and infection; however, they increase the chances that the dog will develop an infection. There is reason to think, therefore, that most dogs with SUR do not develop associated bacterial infections, and there is little evidence for it, but this may vary by tumor location. [4]\n\nThe operating room has to be equipped with a 24/7 positive pressure (PP) airway to maintain normal, favorable pressure for the nasopharynx, right vocal cords, and bone to make the surgical incisions and provide adequate suction. The standard procedures are intraoral aspiration of nasal lavage, tip incision with laminectomy and rabies vaccination, and open infection stage [5]\n\nUrgent skin biopsy (Gastrosurgoscopy) is recommended to rule out systemic complications (Gastroesophageal reflux disease, otologic (mouth or tongue) ectasia, sensitivity pneum", "topp": "Oral Ulceration and Chronic Ulcerative Paradental Stomatitis in Dogs\n\nOral ulceration and chronic ulcerative paradental stomatitis (PUR) in dogs has been described by Thompson et al (1991) and has been reported in 30\u201355% of those receiving oral antimycotics (2).\n\n\nClinical features of the condition include frequent salivation, normal to minimal skin, buccal and pharyngeal pain, respiratory manifestations including cough and/or generalised arousal, heart rate increases and hyperventilation, leukocytosis and bellal-like symptoms (notably dilated diaphragmatic air space, fluorescein is able to be placed in the cleanest possible area (under the tongue) of the mouth and the elimination of periodontal pathogen by the neutrophils). The cervical level of the teeth are often affected; overall clinical severity may be improved with the use of parenteral maintenance therapies. There is no evidence of esophagitis or obliteration of underlying dental structures.\n\n\nA systematic review found that purulent stomatitis is consistently associated with oral medications (3). However, evidence is lacking on the clinical significance of this association. A combination of two clinical studies showed little difference in the onset of oral ulcerative stomatitis in dogs using oral standard antimycotics (a surfactant) and those with oral antibiotic treatment (2). These studies excluded dogs receiving long term oral antibiotic therapy, where patients' resuscitated oral ulcers are likely to develop and they are more likely to have an underlying inflammatory lesion and taste imbalances.\n\n\nAlthough purulent stomatitis can be managed adequately with oral statins and the use of oral antacids (i.e. tooth brushing, maintenance parenteral antibiotic), treatment should be stopped once the infection can be controlled sufficiently. This should always include antibiotic and restorative oral therapy in the long term.\n\n\nLactated Ringer's Syndrome (LRS) and Acute Lysis Bladder Disease (ALD) (i.e. gastric retention)\n\n\nThis condition is relatively uncommon in pets due to canine life cycle, and is the more common reason for veterinary referrals. However it is a condition in which the sac of the tail becomes effaced within the abdomen, causing any water present in the diaphragm and the hind intestine to pool together in a small, effusive sac.\n\n\nLRS is part of a larger disorder, which is the clinical features of ulcerative stomatitis. This encompasses a myriad of different types, i.e. developmental (indirect hooklosis), infectious (Pathogen bacilli, viral, bacterial), chemical, osteoporotic (tissue abscess, first aid, systemic). For a comprehensive overview of the pathogenesis of this condition see * http://www.al-ook.org/about/translations.html\n\nsee *http://www.al-ook.org/about/translations.html There are 3 phases of what occurs, the first is a general increase in food intake; this from normal in all cases of LRS and is how the disease spreads; the second is an increase in sensitivity to the environment in all cases and this is how the disease spreads; the third is an inflammatory response to the initial but this is how the disease spreads through the whole body, and is how these opportunistic pathogens are able to spread.\n\n\nCervical and oropharyngeal ulcers are not good in animals, as they like to remove the lining of the lungs/lower digestive tract, so the surgical procedures tend to be difficult. Other than the inherent risk of mortality and incontinence with any surgical procedures, there are increasing volumes of literature, and increased use of parenteral antimycotics, in trying to lessen this risk. A good guideline would be to ask the patient to establish what is comfortable for them; this will allow for certain health problems to occur if the infection is not managed appropriately. Further I2I surgery offers no relief for this condition, in that other options have to be considered. For a thorough examination of this condition in dogs, see *http://www.al-ook.org/About/index.html.\n\n\nThe Animal Health Foundation's website provides more detail and animal-specific information (including a link to research, if possible): http://www.ahf.org/index.htm\n\nThis website is designed to assist and educate pet owners about their pets' overall well-being in the opinion of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n\nSevere Dermatitis, Allergy & Acne in Cats\n\nIn the skin state the symptoms of the condition are relatively mild in animals, but more stubborn and bothersome in humans. There are at least 3 stages of Severe Dermatitis, or diseases of the skin: basal cell", "human": "Oral Ulceration and Chronic Ulcerative Paradental Stomatitis in Dogs\n\nOral ulceration and chronic ulcerative paradental stomatitis (CUPS) is a disease of the mouth which causes painful ulcers on the gums and mucosal lining of the mouth cavity. The cause of this condition has been determined to be a hypersensitive immune response to bacteria and plaque on the tooth surfaces, and sometimes signs of CUPS will start subsequent to a dental cleaning, when these materials are loosened in the mouth.\n\nWhile it appears that manipulation and antigenic stimulation (substances that stimulate the production of antibodies in the body) in the oral cavity may trigger stomatitis, it is also believed that such animals would probably have eventually developed the disease anyway. In some cases, the only resolution is to remove all of the teeth, so that the bacteria that is normally found on the surface of the teeth is no longer present in the mouth at all.\n\nCertain breeds of dogs appear to be at higher risk for developing this disease. Maltese, cavalier king charles spaniels, cocker spaniels and Bouvier des Flandres have been found to have a higher incidence. One of the complications of CUPS is idiopathic osteomyelitis, inflammation of the bone and marrow, which cocker spaniels have been found to be predisposed to.\n\nSymptoms and Types\n\nBad breath (halitosis)\n\nSwollen gums ( gingivitis )\n\n) Faucitis (inflammation of the cavity at the back of the mouth \u2013 the fauces)\n\nPharyngitis (inflammation of the back of the mouth, continuous into the larynx \u2013 the pharynx )\n\n\u2013 the ) Buccitis/buccal mucosal ulceration (tissue of the inner cheeks)\n\nThick, ropey saliva (ptyalism)\n\nPain\n\nLoss of appetite (anorexia)\n\nMucosal ulceration on the gums that meet the lips \u2013 also called \"kissing ulcers\"\n\nPlaque on teeth\n\nExposed, necrotic bone (alveolar osteitis and idiopathic osteomyelitis)\n\nbone (alveolar and idiopathic osteomyelitis) Scar formation on lateral margins of the tongue from prolonged inflammation and ulceration\n\nCauses\n\nMetabolic\n\nDiabetes mellitus\n\nHypoparathyroidism\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nUremia caused by renal disease\n\nNutritional\n\nProtein-calorie malnutrition\n\nRiboflavin deficiency\n\nNeoplastic\n\nMalignant melanoma\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma\n\nFibrosarcoma\n\nImmune-mediated\n\nPemphigus vulgaris\n\nBullous pemphigoid\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\n\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\n\nDrug-induced\u2015toxic epidermal necrolysis\n\nImmune mediated vasculitis\n\nInfectious\n\nTraumatic\n\nForeign body\n\nBone or wood fragments in mouth\n\nElectric cord shock\n\nMalocclusion of teeth\n\nChemical/Toxic\n\nAcids\n\nThallium\n\nIdiopathic\n\nEosinophilic granuloma - Siberian huskies, samoyeds\n\nCUPS\n\nOsteomyelitis\n\nDiagnosis\n\nYou will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition, such as chewing on cords or other inappropriate objects, recent illnesses, and the usual dental care that is provided. Your veterinarian will exam your dog's oral cavity carefully to determine the extent of the inflammation, or whether any of the teeth are obviously in need of care. Standard tests will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel in order to detect an underlying disease. Diagnostic imaging is also standard in diagnosing dental conditions. X-rays will be taken to determine bone involvement and judge the extent of idiopathic osteomyelitis.\n\nOften chronic antigenic stimulation (from a chronic disease condition) will predispose an animal to development of oral ulceration and stomatitis.

Wright was moving between U.S. and Europe to help back up other clinicians in Europe.\n\n\"She's going to be a concern for us,\" CDC epidemiologist Patricia Kane said of Wright at a news conference Monday. \"We just have a few over-the-counter items and she only has limited access to them.\"\n\nEbola fever causes a fatal syndrome resembling the type of convulsions and fever associated with the West African \"fever\" that began in the country's capital last month, prompting fears that Ebola could spread across the globe.\n\nA multinational team of American and European scientists this week moved into Atlanta as part of their efforts to investigate and stop the spread of the virus. The European Union also announced its own plan to send thousands of workers to the U.S. to fight Ebola. The CDC, meanwhile, announced a major operation to \"devise rapid testing facilities for the highly contagious virus,\" response that could render the vast majority of employees immune to Ebola.\n\nBut as the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency considers expanding its Ebola exposure, a site in Georgia has become the focus.\n\nThe virus-stricken U.S. continues to tap its economies of defense and health care, whose hold is delicate, but needs strong emergency management if this epidemic does indeed turn deadly. The other country that is facing its own Ebola crisis is Syria, where the five-month outbreak has killed more than 1,200 people.\n\nThe uncertainty over the level of risk posed to Americans by the recent crisis has surfaced repeatedly. As the authorities concerned the situation last week, Ebola was not mentioned until last Monday, in a report by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio.

The rest of the cost of polluting comes from transporting, storing and otherwise taking up space, from climate-warming power plants, and from the problems that man-made economic systems cause.\" It's the only line that gets any hysterical accusations to go viral: \"Carbon pollution is truly the chemical equivalent of hell.\" The headline refers to the new EPA rule known as a power plant rule, which requires a \"net zero\" energy installation to comply with the carbon rules. \"It also has to prevent ground-level ozone, which is particularly harmful to old people and families with small children and those with respiratory illness.\" I don't even know why they wrote that. \"The EPA plans to regulate sales of most low-emission vehicles\" just as it does", "human": "Skip to comments.\n\n3,000 \"Ebola Martyrs\" Warned Ready To Strike America\n\nThe Total Collapse ^ | August 16, 2014 | UNK\n\nPosted on by Ghost of SVR4\n\nA new report released in the Kremlin today by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is stating that the reason(s) for President Obama's \"mysterious and unscheduled\" return to the White House this weekend is due the United States facing an \"apocalyptic attack\" from an estimated 3,000 \"Ebola Martyrs\" who are already in America and warned are \"ready to strike\".\n\nAccording to this report, SVR intelligence analysts became aware of the attack planned by these \"Ebola Martyrs\" against the US from their \"monitoring\" of a Islamic State (IS) [also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)] terror cell operating out of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia located in Washington D.C.\n\nIn the past few weeks, this report continues, this IS terror cell has had \"total freedom of movement\" around Washington D.C. with no US intelligence service monitoring of them and have brazenly taken and posted photos of their: 1.) flag pinned to the White House fence and 2.) One of their operatives holding a letter against the backdrop of a US government building that reads:\n\n\"Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon,\" followed by a Koran verse that reads, \"and Allah is perfecting His Light even though the disbelievers hate (that).\"\n\nThe underlying tweet posted with these photos further warned America: \"We are in your state. We are in your cities. We are in your streets.\"\n\nImportant to note, the SVR in this report says, is that like this new attack planned upon America, the Saudis were, likewise, \"deeply responsible\" for the 11 September 2001 attacks upon the US, and as recently verified by US Democratic Representative Stephen Lynch and Republican Representative Walter Jones who publicly warned the American people last December that two administrations have kept 28 pages of a 2002 report on the 9/11 so highly classified that they don't contain redactions \u2014 just an ellipsis noting their absence.\n\nLynch and Jones claim that the 2002 report from Congress after the 9/11 attacks that left 3,000 Americans dead contains material that \"absolutely shocked\" them \u2014 and that pins the blame on Saudi Arabia for state support of the attack.\n\nThough the Saudis deny any role in 9/11, the SVR says, the CIA in one memo reportedly found \"incontrovertible evidence\" that Saudi government officials \u2014 not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom \u2014 helped the hijackers both financially and logistically.\n\nThe intelligence files cited in the 2002 report, it's critical to note, directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war.\n\nNot understandable about Obama, this SVR report further states that upon taking office in 2009, and becoming fully aware of Saudi Arabia's act of war against the US on 9/11, he traveled to their kingdom and \"bowed before their king\".\n\nEven worse, this report continues, where the Bush regime had capped the number of Saudi students allowed into the US to just 10,000 a year, Obama has, since he took office, \"opened the flood gates\" to them to such an extent that now there are over 110,000 of them in America today.\n\nThe danger of allowing so many Saudi students into America, SVR analysts in this report say, is not only due to their involvement in 9/11 (where 15 of the alleged 19 hijackers were Saudi students), but by their sheer numbers as they are not able to be adequately monitored by any US intelligence agency.\n\nOf these over 110,000 Saudi students now in the US, this report warns, around 8,000 of them are devout IS followers financed by the richest terror organization the world has ever known having assests of over US$2 billion all of which was financed by Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd of these 8,000 IS terror members in the US posing as Saudi students, the SVR states, nearly 3,000 have become \"Ebola Martyrs\" willing to die in their \"mission\" of infecting as many Americans as they can before their stated deadline of October.\n\nTo how these \"Ebola Martyrs\" were \"created\", this report continues (and as we had previously reported on), was contained in the Federal Medical-Biological Agency (FMBA) report for the Ministry of Defense (MoD) this week on the ever growing Ebola virus apocalypse currently devastating a number of Western African nations and that no one has been able", "eta_suffix": " terrorists to collect our people as we evacuate them.

I upgrade the drive to an SSD, power down the computer, make a full backup of the OS and its applications (E.g. My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, etc.) using SHUTDOWN, which is the preferred method since you'll be plugging the SSD into the Raid 0 slot, and leaving everything else running on a separate HDD. Then I do a full system backup with Internal hard drive and E-Drive first. I keep the fast SSD plugged in during this process and perform E-hacks (e.g. Non-configurable video drive) and power down later when everything is back up and running. (Aside: Hacking is for science and experimentation to figure out how best to perform physical tasks on a new drive in order to get the best results.)\n\n\n2.) Turn everything off and remove all except for the bare essentials, including the HDD (with the rest of the drives kept on a removable drive). Install in Raid 0 (at least) with the soft disk RAID 0 --HDD configuration I already mentioned, but I removed all 4 drives on the Raid 0 drive to prevent any problem with other drives not being raidable. I then make sure the drives are listed as ES-PhysicalDisks in the 'raidz1' mdadm config options, and config it with the eMMC configuration that I've already discussed. The BIOS MAY assign a number to the drive to be either E-Yes and E-No, or E-Fail. If you don't want that then you just leave it off.\n\n\n3.) Once you've got everything set up, do a \"RAID Z 1\" and power everything off. Then shutdown and turn off everything except for the bare essentials, as you wont want any problems with other drives, including the hard drive. Then plug everything else back in and completely erase everything on your hard drive with SHUTDOWN. I then carry out E-hacks on the E-Hacks flash drive until I've got everything back up and running (preferably before trying to get a E-Swap enough to perform some tasks to which, by the way, the SSDs are not a viable option due to their physical and number limitations).\n\n\n4.) Turn everything back on and run through some clean-up to make the system as NONE/EVERYTHING as is possible. A few important things:\n\n\na.) Make sure your E-Flash is active on the first \"RAID Z 1\" and charge the E-Flash while powering down, it is IMPERATIVE that you charge the flash and E-Flash before turning everything off for a soft shutdown (Power, then on/off. Then power down your computer).\n\n\nb.) Turn off and on your Raid 0 (or the E-Hacks, if it is active), as many for RAID z 1 as you can afford -- I usually run the Raid 0 hard disk if I have only one hard drive so that I can do the raidz1 raid first, then the E-Hacks as fast as possible by making the swap. I then restart everything and do the bare essentials.\n\n\nc.) Once everything is running, make sure you're on the Boot2 Networking/DNS tab. Remove everything except for the RAID0 drive; it will be the first hotlink, see Above, which states there is no next option. Now in the Local Network tab, create a firewall port forwarding and restrict LAN from DHCP (for DHCP, do \"Hostname 192.168.0.1,Alias. that is, 192.168.0.1, actually use an IP address instead of DHCP\"). Now in the Migration tab, create the \"d2ddedice.dll\" on all the Raid0 drives, e.g. \"m0t2.v6\" on one Raid0 drive and \"raw.dll\" on another. I also put it in the \"m0ph.dll\" folder in the desired location.\n\n\nd.) After that, the next good step is to create the SSD RAID0. Install eMMC Bootloader on your SSDs (you don't want to use SATA) and prepare those a little.\n\ne.) Let the rEFInd do its thing until you see \"Configuring Rescue Environment\" appear. You will need to check out the system. We will be using \"System Settings\" tool to create the installation system; you want to keep this very clean since it will have a large chance of atacking your rEFInd.\n\n\nf.)

{"eta": "Dialysis High Costs and Hidden Perils of a Treatment Guaranteed to All\n\nDec. 10: This post has been updated twice.\n\n\nPatients treated at dialysis centers are often denied or are charged exorbitant fees just because there is no subsidy for dialysis, according to a Nov. 8 Los Angeles Times report. The report: a health department investigation into the practices of 21 Los Angeles County agencies for the past eight years.\n\n\nAccording to a court document, the Department of Health and Human Services admits there is no set rate for dialysis, which the Times reports has cost the county about $40 million over the past decade, but the county maintains that these charges do not reflect the actual costs of dialysis.\n\n\n\"As a result, the average charges that county health-care providers collected from the roughly 1,400 patients treated by the clinic at the three local areas were essentially on an hourly basis, with a $24.50, $33.50 or $39.50 charge for a visit that covers the doctor's first visit and any subsequent visits, depending on who is paying for the treatments,\" the documents say.\n\n\nThe Health Care Financing Authority notes that the county relies on privately operated dialysis centers.\n\n\nThe Times also notes that health department documents show many government agencies and public and private-sector Medicaid operators pay significantly less for dialysis, down to $40 or $60 a day.\n\n\nBut Dr. Walter Wu, an oncologist and dialysis expert at a separate Los Angeles medical center, said many cancer patients may end up uninsured because they have to pay the very same $1,000 or more per day. \"The question is whether you are going to get an appointment and have a person at the end of your catheter come along and ask you for a $40 check,\" Wu told the Times.\n\n\nWu did say that high reimbursements for dialysis patients can make the process more expensive. \"It's a complicated decision to go for it,\" he said.\n\n\nAs for those with or without insurance or Medicaid, dialysis can be farmed out to \"the desperate,\" as the Los Angeles Times suggests. It also is a far different treatment than all the other treatments not covered by the state's long-term care program\u2014along with hospitals, treatment centers and dialysis centers.\n\n\nA Word of Caution: Many people get, or have in the past paid, for dialysis on Medicaid or other government programs. The Medicare phone program, along with the Drug-Free Healthcare Act, limit how much reimbursement Medicare pays for certain medically necessary programs such as dialysis.\n\n\nAbout Weights and Measures\n\n\nPediatric Dialysis\n\nThe 2012 National Survey of Acute Dialysis Service Incentives (NSAD-2012) found that that 51% of participants received a physician-written waiver \"for sepsis,\" the presence of cyst-like masses that can be difficult to diagnose in someone who is already critically ill; 36% accepted \"for kidney failure, lymphoma or other cancers, including some types of chronic kidney diseases,\" and 20% accepted because their out-of-pocket expenses had already been covered by their Medicaid or other government insurance and Medicaid paid them $6,000 or less for an inpatient stay. Many of the physician-written waivers grant under these circumstances for bladder-blockers, other medications, certain acupuncture treatments or specific types of therapeutic radiation.\n\n\nThose claims are with the Washington State Department of Health's Claims Management Services (CMRS). Medicaid's CAMIS through the Oregon Health Plan is responsible for Medicare billing on those claims.\n\n\nThe 2012 NSAD also found that about 21% or about 2,100 adults and children received a written waiver that allowed them to make small in-patient stays and perform home dialysis in those instances when they have not been vaccinated. This was in cases when hospitals and clinics were too difficult to find.\n\n\nWhy it's happening\n\nA number of factors contribute to the high rates of access to dialysis in the U.S., but this issue is particularly acute in hospitals and in rural areas. Medicare rates for those who need dialysis are incredibly low.\n\n\nIn comparison to the much higher rates in the U.S. about 10% of adults don't get any type of dialysis anywhere in their lives, due to health risks or financial concerns. In the 2011 NPR report, we noted that one-quarter of patients in Medicare hospitals were considered in \"patient safety\" danger zones as a result of the need to get their fluids in order. Patients with dialysis in their homes are not allowed to go into the community, drive a car, leave the house, visit a doctor, etc.\n\n\nThere are some hints that Medicare may be having problems. In May 2012, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was confronted at a House hearing by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). Connolly said Medicare was not paying its cost of", "topp": "Dialysis High Costs and Hidden Perils of a Treatment Guaranteed to All\n\nDec. 10: This post has been updated twice.\n\n\nPatients treated at dialysis centers are often denied or are charged exorbitant fees just because they're on dialysis.\n\nThe Globe and Mail found so many charges stemming from the expense that a number of dialysis centers have spent upwards of $200,000 for the privilege of accommodating someone on dialysis in a given room.\n\nSome of the cash-strapped centers charge patients for rooms to rent, as if they were paying to rent the room themselves. Others pretend to pay someone's landlord to cover the cost of the room rental. But only a handful of dialysis centers let patients identify the person they're renting the room to, even though that person could have their own room. Without that option, patients could take that $200 or more on an hourly basis to pay for the expense.\n\n\nChris Pizacoba, a 23-year-old former oceanographer from the U.S. who spent years overseas and was recently discharged from a dialysis center, learned that he's now living with the cost of a common dialysis procedure: a charger for his portable kidney.\n\n\nPizacoba, who has pre-diabetes, chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, found a room in a bucolic University of Massachusetts medical center on Cape Cod on Christmas Day for $115 per day. There was so much resistance to paying a room, he asked for a bulk rate.\n\n\nAfter several phone calls, he was eventually presented with the choice of a room or the chargers. \"Which one would you prefer?\" he says. \"Are you a lazy person, are you lazy to pay?\"\n\nThe room cost him a $40 security deposit. He left without paying and turned to a crowdfunding campaign set up by friends. He says it took less than a week for the campaign to raise $40,000 in a month.\n\n\nFinally, Pizacoba was presented with the opportunity to have a single-use charger plugged in at his room, paying him $2 per day. The phone charging station cost $170 for a single-use kit, he says.\n\n\n\"The only choice is a room,\" he says. \"But if I'm going to lose my bedpan, maybe I'd rather get to spend my whole night for free.\"\n\n\nWith stories like this, the chance to pay a phone charger all along sounds nice, but at an estimated $40,000 price tag, it wasn't so great of a deal. But here's the really scary aspect about these bills: Only a handful of dialysis centers allow patients to identify the person they're renting the room to, even though it's their own that's paying the rent.\n\nThe Globe came across two factors that raise questions about how much-discussed these chargers really are. First, many of the institutes that hold the chargers don't protect patient privacy, even though the chargers need to be returned to the center after use. (And if patients don't know who the hotel is paying, for instance, or if they don't know who really owns their room, for that matter, then there's nothing to prevent them from ripping out the charging cables and using them out of their own pocket, as long as they bring in the bill.) And second, patient health could be jeopardized by this third practice \u2013 that patients would somehow be more likely to rip out chargers after visiting an abusive room or getting abused.\n\n\nPatients who wait to rent their own cells are prohibited from once their service is available for at least the week-plus that is needed to reach the necessary decrease, called a \"laboratory\" and otherwise known as a biochemistry lab or diabetic laboratory. (The Globe was told by hospital officials that there are significant costs associated with this. While Ryan is among the many referred to a bio lab, the Journal has also observed that those booked on dialysis are sometimes charged medical co-pays outside the laboratory's walls to go to a doctor.)\n\n\nHospital officials declined comment. Industry insiders say that handling a patient's medication is crucial to delivery of the maximum healing benefit. (Of course, going to the lab to resolve the problem doesn't mean you'll be better, either. Go to the lab, get tested, get prescribed and then go. It's important to note that there are some laboratories that don't charge patients as much as the lab rate.)\n\n\n\"If we have all the money that we need to treat someone, we'll have the best chance to do it,\" says Dr. Paul Tierney, a practicing kidney specialist in Whippany, New Jersey, and chairman of the dialysis policy committee of the American Dialysis Association.\n\n\n\"But we don't have enough room to do it.\"\n\n\nTrial by fire, for dialysis\n\nHow long would", "human": "Dialysis High Costs and Hidden Perils of a Treatment Guaranteed to All\n\nDec. 10: This post has been updated twice.\n\n\nPatients treated at dialysis clinics run by the largest U.S. for-profit chains have a higher risk of death than patients treated by the biggest nonprofit chain, a study released today in the journal Health Services Research concludes.\n\nThe outcome gaps are substantial: Patients at the largest for-profit chain were found to have a 19 percent higher risk of death than patients receiving care at the nonprofit; at the second-largest chain, the risk was 24 percent higher.\n\n\"The difference is very significant,\" said Yi Zhang, who led the study conducted by the Medical Technology & Practice Patterns Institute, a Bethesda nonprofit. \"It's not five or seven percent. It's pretty dramatic.\"\n\nThe study also found that patients had a 13 percent lower mortality risk if they were treated at nonprofit clinics, regardless of chain ownership, than if they received care at for-profit clinics.\n\nThe study's findings are likely to stir debate because U.S. mortality rates for dialysis remain among the highest in the industrialized world -- one in five patients dies each year -- and because more patients than ever are getting their care from for-profit chains.\n\nMore than 80 percent of American dialysis clinics are run for profit. Chain ownership has increased more than 11-fold since the early 1990s. Two for-profit companies -- Fresenius Medical Care North America and DaVita Inc. -- now control about two-thirds of the market for dialysis care.\n\nIn a recent ProPublica investigation, some doctors, patients and advocates voiced concern that industry consolidation has winnowed down care options, thus reducing competition, and questioned whether providers' efforts to make money had affected quality.\n\nToday's study does not identify chains by name, but Fresenius and DaVita ranked first and second in number of clinics in 2004, the start of the study period. Since then, they have acquired the two chains that were next in size. The largest nonprofit chain is Nashville-based Dialysis Clinic Inc.\n\nA Fresenius spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the study's findings until it had a chance to examine them fully. DaVita officials said the study reflected an outdated version of reality.\n\n\"This study examines seven-year-old data, and significant changes in the way dialysis care is delivered have been made in the more than half a decade since, with continued overall improvement in patient outcomes,\" the company said in a written statement.\n\nMore recent information from the federally funded U.S. Renal Data System (USDRS) shows that large dialysis providers achieve better mortality outcomes than nonchain or hospital-based facilities, the DaVita statement added.\n\nThe MTPPI study excluded patients treated in hospital centers -- a key difference with some previous studies -- because they tend to treat patients with more complicating conditions, government data show.\n\nIn comparing chains to each other, however, the study's results largely mirror those in reports by the USRDS showing that Dialysis Clinic Inc. has lower mortality and hospitalization rates than other large dialysis providers.\n\nThe study tracked about 34,900 Medicare patients who started dialysis in 2004 at 3,601 free-standing clinics, following them for two years. Medicare pays for most dialysis under an entitlement created in 1972.\n\nResearchers compared outcomes at the five largest dialysis chains -- four for-profits and one nonprofit -- and at nonchain clinics. They adjusted data for differences in patient mix, as well as for facility size, staffing, geographic disparities and income inequality.\n\nIn addition to lower mortality risk, the study found that patients at the nonprofit chain had the shortest hospital stays and were most likely to be in the recommended range for anemia, despite being given the lowest doses of anemia-treatment drugs. Its clinics also were staffed differently, with more nurses relative to patient-care technicians, who are unlicensed and, typically, lower paid.\n\nUpdate (12/9): DCI did not comment on specific findings but released a statement from founder and board Chairman Dr. H. Keith Johnson saying the chain's \"non-profit status allows us to devote a larger proportion of our resources to improving the care we offer to our patients.\"\n\nUpdate (12/10): Fresenius spokeswoman Jane A. Kramer today issued the following statement:\n\n\"From the study's title, the methods-- all the way to the concluding statements, the authors loosely used the terms chain-affiliation, profit status, and chain size, three separate dimensions, and disingenuously intermingled them to reveal a strong pre-analytic bias.

In it, Haig shows how the colonial European powers took advantage of the opportunities presented by the circumstances of the imperialist formation of Chinese borders during and after WWI. Part one features an introduction, introducing two main themes: a German view of the British as imperialists and the unification of Great Britain and Germany as a single state. Haig sets out to show how the dynamic of the Imperial European-Chinese Imperialist alliance was seen in Germany. In the second part, one encounters a series of chapters that explain the colonial European governments (both former and current) in China, first as the German Imperialist States and later by describing the colonization of China under the former British-German colonialists.\n\nIn the colonizing imperialist: the British among the colonizers in China, Paolo Romagna, et al. (eds.), Routledge, 2014, 44 pp., \u00a320, (paperback)\n\nFrom the early nineteenth century onwards, hundreds of thousands of men took part in the founding of China, which was finally released to British rule in 1895. The British colony of China had changed radically from a fishing and rice-growing area to an agricultural and industrial centre of the world's power. The British were not the only colonial powers in China and it is partly through these colonizations, partly through the support given to them by the rest of the world, and partly through the war of 1894-5, that the colonial powers of European countries established the position of the dominating military force of European colonialism in the world.\n\nIn this highly readable volume, Istv\u00e1n Nagy, Philip McManus and Gert Martinowiak (eds.), Twenty-seven years of human rights violations: The democratization of international armed conflicts, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2007, 123 pp., $20.95 (paperback)\n\nMysterious images of undelivered packages at the Vietnam War protests, fire-bombed Soviet cities, mass-murderers at Abu Ghraib, mass-murderers in Africa, and the unrest in Tahrir al-Aqsa on the Middle East land and sea borders, heralded the war by the dominant international media. Nevertheless, these images did not portray these crimes as international acts of war; they depicted them rather as acts of revenge for the repeated and brutal executions of civilians by the occupying armies.\n\nIn this book, an innovative approach is followed, in which the interpretation of historical and cultural contexts in which these incidents occurred is used to draw out their political implications.\n\nThe Memorialized British Empire is a catalogue of British post war territorial acquisitions at the turn of the twentieth century, including colonization of India and Cape Colony, with special reference to the subjugation of Africa and the formation of the United Nations.\n\nMarina Dettori, Casa da Africja: A Cultural History of Malta, November 2014, 23 pp., \u00a37.99 (Hardcover)\n\nA range of English-language works includes this book from a US national history professor, marinating in the present.\n\nFred deBoer et al., Conquest in the French and Indian Ocean Seas, Andrzej Przeworski, and Lois Janowski, editors., Anthropography, Press of Americas, 2014, 340 pp., $25.00 (paperback)\n\nMore than 50 years after the ending of WWII in Europe, historians continue to debate the extent to which French imperialism played any leading role in its demise. Most still deny that the British and their allies used any policy of empire building. In this debate, Fred deBoer, and co-editors Lois Janowski, and Andrzej Przeworski, have done so in a way that has profound implications for subsequent histories of colonial and post-colonial politics, including their own.\n\nDeep down at the core of colonial and post-colonial politics are the conflicts over whether and how colonial and post-colonial societies' progress towards freedom is possible and desirable. Thus, instead of combating emancipation, some anti-colonial historians have argued that historical understanding cannot begin until it has paid off its central (and often misrecognized) claim to moral authority. I applaud their effort. We must redouble our efforts to understand \"imperial\" history.\n\nIn this volume, history's most influential living and foremost historian of post-colonial Latin America speaks about his specific focus on the space where colonial and post-colonial ideals meet and confront each other.\n\nIn this book, political scientist Francis Fukuyama revisits his classic Confrontation: The Social Construction of Race, an important intellectual work on race politics since the 1960", "topp": "Guillaume Faye, The Colonization of Europe, Arktos, 2016, 400 pp., $30.40 (softcover)\n\nThe Colonization of Europe was a conceptual work that was created by R\u00e9mi Guyert. While describing France in the 1840s, Guyert produced this first detailed theoretical analysis of the \"colony\" that comprised it, and for that he was considered the grandfather of French colonial theory. Guyert's The Colonization of Europe, which is published as a posthumous work in Arktos, revises his own conception of the French colonies of Western Europe by proposing a \"new\" colonial economy and politics. Guillaume Faye, author of the earlier Fragments and Fragments: Ethnology and Anthropology in France and the Allies, revises Guyert's analysis along with exploring parallel systems of political organization between European governments (both former colonies), and between urban elites and government bureaucracy.\n\nGuyert's essay spans the colonization of France in the years 1840-55, from the Parliamentary Discourses to Fichte on the discovery of the New World, to the individual and national emancipation movements of the period. Guyert analyzes the new dominant economic institutions, political parties, and interests in contemporary France: part of the reason Guyert concludes that he has succeeded in bringing out such an important aspect of colonialism, is his careful attention to the integral use of \"civilizing\" or liberalization that Guyert insists was the forerunner of the new form of colonialism. To the extent that Guyert was to be believed, new models for trade were the long-term expression of an emerging form of investment, based on the confusion of subjective needs and a culturally captured mentality.\n\nAfter the material essence of Guyert's essay is addressed, Faye compares the concepts of colonization and the planning of European citizenship with the liberalism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as well as Jacques Lacan. Faye discusses both the connection between economic or market rationality and a bourgeois order, and the tensions between the interests of the \"racialized\" classes and the interests of the \"citizens,\" people who are admitted to certain ethnic and cultural categories. He also critically analyses the larger notion of what was to become the \"colony,\" and the understanding of its economic form through its claims to citizenship. Faye argues that for Guyert, both \"civilization\" and \"modernity\" are mutually exclusive, and that any attempt to speak of a \"civilized\" nature of modernity can only concern the \"civilized\" aspects of modernity, while the borders of colonial and liberal \"civilization\" are not geographic or social, but are political and legal \u2013 they are the subject of Guyert's work, and therefore socialized, depending on the logic of the administrative administration of the new colonial order. Faye demonstrates these articulations of Guyert's agenda in his essays which heavily borrow from Lacan, Hoel, and Foucault. Faye aims to overthrow the consuetudy question in which Guyert states, \"the institutions that are able to conserve civility are those most congenial to current culture \u2026. to the pooling of a spirit that is neither of the Latin stock nor of the mixed moderner. As it is divided between the magnitudes of a sovereign and of a citizen, ethnos without citizenship brings conflict and despotism\".\n\nFaye draws attention to French architect and decorative arts scholar Jean-Honor\u00e9 Mangin and the controversy surrounding French designs for new monuments during the 1970s, focusing on the form of the \"facade\" in building projects, with an emphasis on \"benevolent facilitation of immigration and growth\", and the domestic presence of the visiting elites of France in newly created towns, cities, etc. Mangin on purpose aimed to relocate the subjects of public life from the garden to the house.\n\nSelected appendixes recount Guyert's debate with Camus about \"new colonialism.\"\n\nGuyert was widely criticized for encouraging efforts to, among other things, intermingle the so-called \"French language\" with national textbooks, a modernity predicated on the dissolution of the social regime and the substitution of the family model for a work-based worker-beneficiary system. Guyert comes under vehement attack when he says, \"On no grounds did I intend to create a prejudice against the French, nor to promulgate the belief of one who calls himself an optimist. Once we get past the menace of miscegenation, some expressions of French I prefer to call lamentable. Some French I dislike, but some more.\" Guyert went on to state that he would not accept the accusation of hostility towards the French, and he assures his readers, \"The psychological theories of the linguistic anthropologists may make me disapprove of their conduct, but they do not inforce me with political prejudices. Political prejudices, they say, induce people to take refuge in random stratagems, in trust-bondages, in assumption of", "human": "Guillaume Faye, The Colonization of Europe, Arktos, 2016, 400 pp., $30.40 (softcover)\n\nThe Colonization of Europe was written 16 years ago by a Frenchman about a continent 3,500 miles away from ours, and yet the racial crisis it describes is virtually identical to our own. Even more eerily\u2013and what makes this book so valuable\u2013its analysis of the lickspittle mentality of European whites is a near perfect diagnosis of America's rulers. Despite distance, language and cultural barriers, and even a long history of Franco-American antagonism, the same psychological disease rages on both sides of the Atlantic. All Western nations have the same disease. This is deeply sobering, but our similarities are so great that if even just one government pulls back from the brink, it could be a model for the rest.\n\nThe author of The Colonization of Europe is the prolific and talented Guillaume Faye, who wrote Convergence of Catastrophes, Why We Fight, and Archeofuturism, all offered to English-speaking readers by the increasingly indispensable Arktos. He has also spoken at two American Renaissance conferences, where he electrified audiences with his passionate defense of the West. He is one of the great spokesman for our people.\n\nColonization\n\n\"Europe,\" Mr. Faye writes, \"is undergoing a demographic and ethno-cultural tragedy.\" With France in the lead, it is allowing itself to be colonized by aliens, often the very people Europeans colonized in the 19th century. This time, however, it is \"colonization from below\" by floods of non-whites who, through force of numbers, are conquering a continent their own nations could never hope to dominate by force.\n\nMr. Faye cites two causes. One is the expansionist nature of Islam, which, since it crossed the Straits of Gibraltar in 711 AD, has always coveted Europe. But far more dangerous is the catastrophic loss of will by Europeans, who act as if they believe in \"the natural right of all human beings to settle in Western Europe.\" As Mr. Faye writes, \"Throughout the Third World, we are spreading the word: 'Europeans do not defend themselves. They pity us and would never dare evict us.' \"\n\nPromoting colonization is the new European religion: Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and even Communists all cooperate in welcoming Muslims who hate them. Socialists and Greens like immigration because they think Arabs and Africans will vote for the Left\u2013and many do\u2013but Mr. Faye calls this a short-term, suicidal strategy because immigrants will surely start their own Muslim-ethnic political parties and spurn the Left.\n\nPoliticians are also united: \"The soft Right allows our colonization to take place through its own laziness, its weariness, and out of fear of being accused of inhumanity, while the insane Left encourages settlement through political miscalculation and ideological passion.\" Except for a few dissidents, Europeans are drunk on Kool-Aid: \"Just like in the Coca-Cola formula, it is difficult to determine the proportion of imbecility, hallucinated altruism, anti-racist snobbery, ethnomasochism, and political (mis)calculation that is in this cocktail.\"\n\nEvery public figure in France today, writes Mr. Faye, would agree that \"racism is personally what he hates most and is the ultimate sin against the human spirit.\" To dissent on race or immigration \"is to risk ostracism, professional banishment, and moral or criminal conviction.\"\n\nThe result is incoherence. The French government officially takes no notice of race or religion, because Frenchmen are defined only by \"republican values.\" Therefore, there is no official count of non-whites and Muslims. However, everyone knows that they clump together in what are euphemistically known as \"sensitive\" areas where even the police often fear to go. The government is therefore careful to send in only non-white mail carriers, school teachers, and census takers because whites would be attacked. Mr. Faye laughs at this sensitivity to a reality that officially does not exist\u2013a \"beautiful contradiction,\" he calls it.\n\nAnyone who wants better data on race is suspect. Mr. Faye cites the case of lefty demographer Mich\u00e8le Tribalat who wanted to know the number of non-whites so she could calculate their underrepresentation in elite jobs. She was accused of being part of the \"extreme right.\" Mr. Faye calls this preference for ignorance \"breaking the thermometer;\" the patient is near death but refuses to hear the diagnosis.\n\nOf course, everyone knows the truth anyway.

{"eta": "It's The Song I Hate\n\nBen Watson, Adorno for Revolutionaries\n\nUnkant, 217pp, \u00a310.99, ISBN 9780956811509\n\nPreviously in this series\n\nThe structure of the everyday is rooted in the repeated experience of violence, oppression and marginality \u2013 a form of repetition we can recognise when we make fun of it. So too as Adorno explains, we can recognise the structure of a folk song or symphony when we deconstruct the words to hear what's behind them. Since literature has often been concerned with such repetition, it's only natural to focus on the repetition of everyday words like'self' and 'addiction'.\n\nBut does it matter which kind of repetition we examine most closely? The main point in this post is that the repetition of everyday words carries a significance that goes even beyond our perspective. It's on this kind of repetition that we can sense a contingent yet highly symbolic place. As Adorno notes, the repetitive repetition of'self' (and that of 'addiction') is part of a 'constant cognitive orbit', in which we hear oneself just fine, sometimes with satisfaction, sometimes not.\n\nAnthropology has long understood this form of repetition as an intentional system of making-up for individual and communal loss, and one part of this system is recognition. Poetry \u2013 of which folk songs are a core part \u2013 relies heavily on recognition in its structure. For Adorno and Horkheimer, poetry comes into it in terms of contrast; it looks at the past, experiencing ourselves as the result of'setting', the setting of things at the moment when we were created. This aesthetic belief, I'd argue, is central to understanding the ways in which many folk songs constitute a dialectical encounter with the past \u2013 something that always happens. The past being their target and everyone they come into contact with (whether it's a member of the immediate family, a contemporary political activist, or an anglophone you meet).\n\nBut though I will argue that the same function of recognition exists in folk music, I think it is more instructive to focus on the language of history in the sense I've used. Here, we need to contrast in terms of everyday re-statement with historical repetition. Adorno is not referring to the interpretation of these two different kinds of words, but to the way in which they are transferred to language. Consider the way that the repetition or'set' of the past turns itself into a kind of (foreign) 'everywhere': poems such as the French story Sommet's Lucky Dragon (1851) offer, in fact, a phrase that starts as the result of'setting-up', just as the 'everyplace' the ear hears'set' became the 'everywhere' that'set' finds itself in later. It's in this sense that what we hear at the start of the present passage begins as 'everywhere: again'.\n\nOn the face of it, it seems such a mundane, natural turn of phrase is quite wonderful. So it is when we take the position that to this kind of recurrence of past re-statement we can see the patterns that form as the historical meaning of these words really happen \u2013 something which Adorno (and Horkheimer) would refer to at times as'mystical'.\n\nBut in order to see how and when this process of re-recurrence takes place, we have to think in terms of the role of words and meaning. Much of the time, folk musicals maintain a phenomenology of this whole conversation. There has always been an instinct for bringing a certain degree of sameness to the spontaneous mixtures of sound and visual, as well as body, that are contemporary with the movements. But I think this instinct arises from a highly relational thought. While there is no shame in making up for history with noise and historical randomness, we cannot neglect the structures that begin to create a hybrid in all of this. These structures of social connection do not necessarily fit into the linear structure of literature, but they are commonplaces enough. So language, it seems to me, is a common place for a whole range of social systems: from the way people work together (as in wartime) to the ways that a way of life is lived \u2013 the informal locations of organisation and sustenance that make the routine act of making-up for a mishap, to the ways in which a language is transmitted between people, leaving it in any number of very different forms: family, tribe, neighborhood.\n\nBut what is the connection between these sites of community, and what are the institutions that also play such a major role? I think there's one in particular: the institution of the family \u2013 the home of almost all human societies. This is, to return to my point, the process whereby people learn to live in their own kind of world and through their own world. (This has particular significance in the modern world for the ways in which that", "topp": "It's The Song I Hate\n\nBen Watson, Adorno for Revolutionaries\n\nUnkant, 217pp, \u00a310.99, ISBN 9780956811509\n\nPreviously in this series\n\nThe structure of the everyday is rooted in dissociation, especially in the commercial and productive. An aesthetic ideal, to live as a creative artist is to build a chamunda as emotionally free as possible. And as the pages of a book are more important than the imagined movements of the chamunda, the answer is serendipitous. Where that artistic answer is surprising, it is an avant-garde delight. There is a constant mantra that with writing, songs, photographs, sound and film, it is possible to examine the visual and the sensory; it's not about the opposite; it's about the opposite and that, even if it sounds absurd, is where you aim, against the corporatising cultural hegemony.\n\nThe introspection of the song, the wedding, the feminist impulse, the enthusiasm that still transcends all boundaries, converge to create an 'artificiality', now felt unthinkable through so much gluttony and sex. The book feels very much like some existential mad experience from Baudrillard's Nouvelles d'un Foucauld with 'routines', 'tricks' to deal with the drudgery of their everyday lives, but it sees what I would call the body as the answer for silence and punishment.\n\nVita Madera\n\nOn the Walled Village\n\nVirginia Marcial, Grasset\n\nPreviously in this series\n\nHeinrich Heine would be wary of using a term like I live inside and it's all falling apart, but he does: she beautifully describes their surreal encounter at a party with something like the crazed glee of working out the facts of a sexual awakening. They're not fooling around, he's asking 'what do you mean when you say I live inside you?' but she slips into the utterly worn and liberated territory of a conversation you might hear just a few years before you where she's best described as 'turbulence in prose' or 'all over the place'.\n\nPeter Sultwell\n\nToo Much is\u2026\n\nJulian Barnes, Seven Stories\n\nPreviously in this series\n\nThis haunting book has recently been published in English translation, a tribute of memory to the artists Peter Husband or Pino Donini who changed the experience of friendship to include as much as possible, and to enjoy the experience of bringing the dots together. This finding of freedom combines the former influences, experience and thought of many artists whose turn of thought on art sits at both poles of the cultural band. The book's allusions to Brecht, Rossini, Zola and Picasso are due to Husband, Donini and Agnes Martin, not just Husband's own writing; his references to artist and master role models are also Willem de Kooning, James McManus, Paulo Coelho, Heinrich Heine and Maurizio Cattelan. The author's italics are intelligible, but not engaging.\n\nKatherine Scott\n\nThird Day\n\nKatherine Scott, Hand and Other Poems\n\nPreviously in this series\n\nIt is popularly believed that contemporary artists have no time for literature or fiction. Reading culture constantly changes our experience of reading, nothing says, 'A side of facts, art, music or words, grown up stuff from your lo-fi, freewheeling days' like being thrust into a tablecloth in your twenties on whatever dumb luxury jamboree occupied the beach (all the more important and, as it was, blank!) you're fortunate enough to be aboard. Sir Quentin Blake sums it all up by saying you're looking for something 'deep and truthful'. Young people act as historical random markers, reducing fear and doubt to desperation and letting go. Third Day occupies a space between history and fiction, two legacies not wanting to share. The sun is beating down hard on the beach, our co-ed 'Bonnie and Clyde' has left the wooden huts and washed ashore in their warm white weather coat. A sea serpent wants to dive and molt into a wayward child only to be met by a friendly sea serpent with a small feminine face and sea-landing abilities. Three boys try to stop the baby sea serpent being smashed by the giant hand, leaving it scuttling around on the beach with little hands for feet. Amor fati! [God Protects!]. The beach bears little resemblance to the civilisation before and the car has turned into a dune buggy.

He has a poet's love of language and a leftist's love of polemic. He skips, sometimes disconcertingly, from music to philosophy, from literature to politics to (sometimes rather shaky) history. He has powerful enthusiasm \u2013 mainly for musicians you've probably never heard of \u2013 and powerful distaste. Given the many causes for grief and anger in this world, it is bewildering to see so much fury directed against an anodyne sociologist like Simon Frith. (One of Frith's alleged crimes is liking the Pet Shop Boys.)\n\n\nWatson is adept at causing offence. As the introductions to items in this volume show, he appears to have repeatedly fallen out with those one might na\u00efvely see as his intellectual or political allies. In a colourfully bad-tempered exchange with Gordon Finlayson he argues that ad hominem attacks are based on Marxist principle ('social being determines consciousness'). He can be sorely irritating yet also strangely endearing; nobody who compares Slavoj \u017di\u017eek and Sting as products of the star system can be all bad.\n\n\nThe present book is a collection of articles and reviews about music, all taking as a central point of reference the ideas of Theodor Adorno, the German philosopher and musicologist (1903 - 1969). For Watson the important thing about Adorno is his Marxism, since 'the only \"science\" that could unite the critical energies of mass music is revolutionary Marxism.' Adorno saw music as a 'historical product', understood in relation to class and technology; he 'wanted to develop a theory of music that \u2026 turned musical taste into a political question.'\n\n\nThere are many insights here, as when Watson demolishes the rhetoric of \"hard work\" by invoking the Marxist theory of value: 'if a competitor finds a way of producing twice the widgets in half the time, your labour time has an exchange value of only a quarter of what it was before, however much effort you put in.' But the central claim of the relation between music and politics leaves more questions unanswered than it resolves. To refer to 'Schoenberg's twelve-tone revolution' is selfevident in terms of musical form; but is there any direct connection between this and the social revolution aspired to by Marxists? The example of Rock Against Racism (in which Watson was an activist), which united punk and the far left to isolate the National Front in the 1970s, is significant but not sufficient. Is there in fact such a thing as 'music structurally opposed to capitalism'?\n\n\nAs a result of this tenuous association, he often lapses into selective approval and wishful thinking. With some justice he derides the influence of Stalinism on artists in the 1930s. Yet Brecht, who made a virulent defence of the Moscow Trials, escapes criticism. Brecht's Stalinism does not make him a bad playwright; nor does his dramatic prowess make him an anti-Stalinist. There is a contradiction here, and Watson, for all his invocation of 'dialectics', fails to grasp it. Likewise Luk\u00e1cs is dismissed: 'The sensitive bourgeois Hegelian could hail revolution as the solution to history without being transformed thereby in the process.' He is compared unfavourably to Walter Benjamin. Yet Luk\u00e1cs took part in a real revolution (Hungary 1919), whereas Benjamin's record of political activism is decidedly meagre.\n\n\nLuk\u00e1cs developed the notion of 'imputed' class consciousness \u2013 referring not to the ideas actually in workers' heads, but the potential consciousness the working class was historically capable of achieving. Often it seems that we are dealing here with an 'imputed' Adorno, one who thinks what Watson believes he ought to. As he puts it: 'The modern response to Adorno needs to break the bounds of official Adornoism, and break into analysis of musics he turned his back on or never heard.' But could it ever be more than a provocative speculation to assert: 'Adorno is much more likely to understand punk than someone who treats it as \"pop\"'?\n\n\nThis book may encourage people to read or re-read Adorno, and perhaps to discover that he was not quite such a splendid chap as Watson makes out. Watson does at least have the honesty to note that \u2013 like his other heroes, the Situationists \u2013 Adorno failed the test of 1968. There is plenty more in this book, a fair amount good, some bad.

Greater cooperation among countries seems to be the only hope if this scourge is to be eradicated one day. Such cooperation takes various forms, and is set out in more concrete form in three international Conventions: the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (Single Convention, 1961),([1]) the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971([2]) and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 (Convention against Illicit Traffic).([3]) As their titles suggest, these conventions deal with matters that are specific to the problems of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and the traffic in these, which are discussed in greater detail below.\n\nCanada is a Party to each of these Conventions, and takes an active part in the international battle against the illicit trade in drugs. These Conventions require that member states adopt specific legislative measures against the trade in illicit drugs. In 1996, the Canadian legislation on this subject was revised to, among other things, ensure that it complied with Canada's international obligations.([4])\n\nThe following pages give a brief description of: the most important of the undertakings made by the parties to these three Conventions; key comments on the scope of those undertakings; and the procedures that the parties are to follow in complying with them. Before proceeding with the description and comments, however, the relationship between international law and Canadian domestic law is discussed. In addition, the appendix describes the procedure for concluding, implementing, ratifying and coming into force of an international treaty in Canada.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF TREATIES IN CANADA\n\nIn Canada, the legislative branch (i.e., Parliament and the provincial legislative assemblies) have sole jurisdiction to make rules,([5]) which they do by enacting legislation.([6]) They may also enact provisions delegating the rule-making power to a regulatory authority. The only limits on this power are those imposed on the legislative branch by the Constitution. Examples of limitations on the power of the legislative branch are the requirement that the division of legislative powers between the federal and provincial governments not be violated, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.([7])\n\nHowever, other considerations apart from the Constitution may influence the exercise of legislative power. Implementation of an international treaty is one example. By becoming a party to the three treaties on illicit drugs and traffic in illicit drugs, the Government of Canada has undertaken to adapt its own legislation on drugs to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the treaties. All the measures that a state must take domestically to comply with the provisions of an international treaty constitute the \"implementation\" of the treaty. The most obvious step in implementing a treaty is the adoption or amendment of legislative provisions.\n\nNot all treaties entered into by Canada require legislative action. If domestic legislation already complies with the undertakings made, as is often the case, there is no need for legislative action. If the treaty has no effect in domestic law, again, there is no need for legislative action.\n\nHowever, before ratifying an international treaty, the Governor in Council should ensure that the Government of Canada complies with the obligations imposed on the States that are party to the treaty. Otherwise", "eta_suffix": " the associated notification and destruction of that class of drugs.\n\nArticle 10 of this Convention prohibits such authorisations or undertakings as are in such a position as to facilitate the trading and trafficking in illicit drugs.\n\nArticle 11 of this Convention prescribes criminal procedures with respect to the production or supply of illicit drugs.

No inpatient episodes of gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in patients with repeated operations. Metabolic acidosis and mephibes were generally below a control threshold in all groups (standard deviations are presented in Tables 1 and 2).\n\nThis randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to test the safety of acid secretion in one of the two long-term surgical groups of gastric bypass. Fifty patients with lower urinary tract acid secretion, sustained for \u226540 days by repeated ACG or long term, used a general anaesthetic with gastric bypass for operation. These patients underwent the associated assessment with functional values of the lower urinary tract in two different time points from a period of 5 weeks to 1 month after the operation, giving a total of 60 patients. The last 4 individuals underwent total ACG on the same day, giving a total of 8 patients.\n\nA survey was performed on all patients, and 65% were eligible for inclusion in the study. The eligible participants had low blood pressure, stable laboratory, oesophageal and kidney function, and were ambulatory for \u22655 days, and had not had gastroesophageal reflux disease for at least 3 weeks. Inclusion criteria for the study did not include any confounding factors, as this would prevent evaluation of risk factors for gastric bypass (e.g. diabetes, heart failure and renal failure) and its associated complications, which might confound results.\n\nFor the study, a daily oral dose of 20 mg, 70 mg or 100 mg of oxalate was chosen, with 40 and 80 mg being administered separately. Patients were instructed on ingesting the therapy within the first 3 days postoperatively. The primary objective was to assess the duration of of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. The study also compared the rate of inpatient reflux episodes in those of the ACG and the prolonged upper urinary tract acidosis in a group (n = 23) already free of reflux symptoms. Finally, in a secondary analysis, the degree of inpatient acidosis was identified as a composite outcome of symptoms, clinically significant acidosis and controlled acid secretion in a group previously free from reflux symptoms.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis multicenter, controlled, open-label, randomised trial from The Gastrointestinal Surgery Center found that 40 mg/day of acid for 18 weeks achieved higher upper urinary tract acid excretion (volume) than the current standard of care. The lower urinary tract acid secretion at Week 1 reached a cumulative AUC of 0.62 \u00b1 0.57 mg/dl (SD = 0.29) during the first 2 weeks, reaching a mean AUC (volume) at Week 20 of 1.28 \u00b1 0.33 mg/dl (SD = 0.33).\n\nIt is well established that systemic acid secretion is important for prevention of reflux, and that the lower urinary tract is an important physiological portal of entry of dietary acid (55, 56). However, with the increase in the incidence of non-hemorrhagic gastroesophageal reflux disease across the world (57, 58), many gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, especially in the elderly, have been underestimated and, thus, have been neglected. Further research is needed that assess the specific health factors relevant to prevention and management of reflux disorders.\n\nIt has been suggested that to prevent reflux disease, the upper urinary tract should contribute primarily, if its normal pH exceeds its upper limit of 8.5\u20139.5, to the total gastric acid excretion (59, 60). Therefore, the aim of this trial was to assess whether the higher urinary tract acid secretion produced by ACG at Week 1 and thereafter in patients with longer-term ACG from surgery is clinically relevant to preventing reflux disease. Such a relationship has never been established, although it is well known that during ACG and strict gastric bypass, upper-ascending acid secretion is favoured and thus may be a beneficial reference pattern (61). In some cases in which pH drops to below 6.0, treatment with acid should concentrate on the upper urinary tract (61, 62, 63) and the lower urinary tract with its associated kidney and heart rate response to CSF acid suppression. This could be particularly relevant in patients with chronic gastric bypass", "topp": "This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).

No inpatient episodes of gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in patients with repeated operations. Metabolic acidosis and mephibes were generally below a control threshold in all groups (relative risk: 0.57, 95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.82; p = 0.20 and 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.91; p = 0.21, respectively) although there was an increasing trend towards reduced intake. The mean home tube pH was slightly less than the upper limit of normal (<6.5) in almost all patients in the associated community-based non-diagnostic lab tests of H 2 flux (p = 0.17), the lipid profile (p < 0.01) and in the HDW last 4 wk (p = 0.04). In the controls no subjects' measured serum fluorescence was abnormal for creatinine, phosphorylcholine, total glucose and urea nitrogen. Our score was within the normal range in the preoperative Open informed consent recording. There were nine control subjects with clearly abnormal data, four with data suggestive of an abnormality, two with data suggestive of nondisjunction and one with diagnostic range deficiency. In all 3 diabetic subjects, fasting HbA1c and HOMA-IR were significantly lower than control (p = 0.03 and p = 0.008, respectively). Diabetes history before surgery was not explained in the controls. In the control group both concentration and outcomes, above and beyond control, were closely associated with baseline C-peptide levels. These were unchanged in patients after 6 weeks of gastric bypass. Both basal insulin and glucagon levels decreased in the control group, suggesting that the energy requirement was lowered and that this resulted in an increased nitrogen acid flux. Reported rate of inpatient admissions did not differ between groups.\n\nWe were concerned to know whether these non-specific nitrite findings would reflect transient acidosis or long-lasting symptoms for our patients, including symptoms of glycosuria and gastrointestinal damage after the actual operation. We thus asked our endoscopists to determine whether negative urinary nitrite and nitrogen balance also confounded our combined laparoscopic (WP) and gastroplasty patient studies. In one set of initial middle-aged males given controlled diets (Calan & Law, 1967) for 18 months before procedures, in which urine nitrogen consumption and nitrite excretion were monitored, there were no nitrite and nitrite \"nits\" in the right kidney and bladder (p = 0.57; p = 0.84; p = 0.42 for urinary pH, p = 0.23; p = 0.47; and p = 0.68; for the repeated open GI coagulation count, p = 0.55). Nitrite values were within 1 of control; the kidney was usually bright red. Every two weeks urine sample at the ankle collected at least once (except for voiding urine, which was never collected). A pattern of slowing and discontinuation with the interventions was noted.\n\nThe range of carbohydrate intake was comparable between the control group and the leading 3 most severely afflicted patients; carbohydrates content for the remaining patients was comparable but never significantly different from control. The PICO (Protein Interenergy Organs) score was all within the normal range in all patients and patients in the associated community-based non-diagnostic lab tests of H 2 flux (p < 0.01), lipid profile (p < 0.01) and 18 wk HDW last 4 wk (p = 0.15) (see below). Measurement of HOMA-IR did not vary between controls and control, with variation broadly consistent between higher-fat and diabetic patients, with significant differences among them only in the first two weeks after initiation of diets (data not shown). HOMA-IR is normally 5 to 9 %.\n\nDuring the first 3 weeks of the prescribed diets, 24 patients with a fatal vascular accident, 24 with normal cardiovascular disease, 26 with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2 with depression or suicidal ideation had either a complete or partial right leg amputation. During the second 3 weeks, following the median halothane dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, the control group significantly increased the total body TAs", "human": "This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).

Yet cognitive scientists largely remain oblivious to research into microbial behavior that might provide insights into problems in their own domains, while microbiologists seem equally unaware of the potential importance of their work to understanding cognitive capacities in multicellular organisms, including vertebrates. Evidence in bacteria for capacities encompassed by the concept of cognition is reviewed. Parallels exist not only at the heuristic level of functional analogue, but also at the level of molecular mechanism, evolution and ecology, which is where fruitful cross-fertilization among disciplines might be found.\n\nThe review is organized into two parts. Part 1 provides an introduction to the study of cognition. Part 2 sets out a proposed bacterial cognitive toolkit. Because there is a great deal of ground to cover, and not a lot of space to cover it in, the mechanisms of how systems work will be sketched in broad outline, not in detail, except in those cases where the details are either not widely known or not easily accessible in the literature. The aim here is to stimulate microbiologists to think about their work in the broader context of a cognitive biology ( Kov\u00e1c, 2000 ; Auletta, 2011 ; Bechtel, 2014 ; Fitch, 2014 ) and to consider designing experiments to explicitly enhance this understanding.\n\nIn the hope of stimulating interest among microbiologists in this area, this review brings together contemporary evidence for cognition in eubacteria in core areas of cognitive research: sensory ST, valence, communication, sensorimotor coordination, memory, learning, anticipation, and decision making in complex and changing circumstances. The article will show that parallels exist not only at the heuristic level of functional analog, but also at the level of molecular mechanism, evolution and ecology, which is where fruitful cross-fertilization among disciplines might be found. Archaea, whose behavior is less well documented and appear (so far) to possess far fewer ST systems than bacteria ( Ulrich and Zhulin, 2010 ), will not be discussed here.\n\nYet, while work on bacterial adaptation underlies the contemporary biological understanding of sensory ST ( Wadhams and Armitage, 2004 ), and ST in turn provides the foundation of the information-processing approach to cognition that (rightly or wrongly) remains the hallmark of the 'cognitive revolution' ( Miller, 2003 ), cognitive scientists are largely oblivious to research in this and other areas of microbial behavior that might provide insights into problems in their own domains. For example, some flagellated bacterial species, paradigmatically Escherichia coli, have been found to possess large clusters of interacting sensory receptors, typically at the leading pole of the cell, which function as complex information-processing units linked to motor activity ( Hazelbauer et al., 2007 ) and have been dubbed by some a 'nanobrain' ( Webre et al., 2003 ). Meanwhile, microbiologists seem equally unaware of the potential importance of their work to understanding cognitive capacities in metazoans including vertebrates.\n\nThe idea that microbes might know their world, not merely bump into it, is controversial but unoriginal. At the beginning of the 20th century, Jennings (1905/1962 ) claimed the behavior of the 'lower animals,' notably paramecia but including bacteria, could tell us much about the behavior of the 'higher animals,' including humans. The Animal Mind ( Washburn, 1936 ), the first US textbook on comparative psychology (first edition 1908), begins with amoeba. Biochemist Daniel Koshland provided the modern scientific equivalent of Jennings' argument in an under-appreciated monograph on bacterial chemotaxis (CT) as a model system for the study of behavior, and remarked (following Pope) that \"the proper study of mankind is the bacterium\" ( Koshland, 1980b ). Philosopher of science Karl Popper went further and argued (only slightly tongue-in-cheek) that in the evolution of problem-solving \"from the amoeba to Einstein is just one step\" ( Popper, 1999 ).\n\nKeep in mind that a great deal of complexity will be obscured in the simplifications that follow.
