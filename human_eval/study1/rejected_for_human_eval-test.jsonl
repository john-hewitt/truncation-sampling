That trend continued on Saturday, as the team scored 28 and forced the Lakers to do the heavy lifting on offense. \"It's different being in a small town, being a part of a team, than that small market you are in around there, that whole system that's going on,\" said All-Star Kevin Love. Love totaled 30 points and 17 rebounds for Minnesota, which dominated offensively while outrebounding the Lakers 25-14. LaMarcus Aldridge added 21 and 12 rebounds for Los Angeles, which won for the fourth time in five games after dropping six in a row, including a 104-85 drubbing in the Lakers' first matchup on Jan. 9. \"We're not going on vacation to Miami,\" center Marc Gasol said. \"This is our home town.\" The Timberwolves have won five in a row at Target Center dating to last season. They haven't beaten the Lakers in Los Angeles since a 101-97 win on Jan. 18, 2009. \"We need to go out there and play up to our name,\" DeMarcus Cousins added. \"That's what we're doing.\" The Timberwolves' NBA-worst 3-point percentage of 33.5 fell to 25.2 percent in Saturday's 105-96 loss in Utah. They had hit nearly a third of their 3s in two games, going 8 of 20 from beyond the arc. They were also outrebounded 44-26 by the Jazz. \"It sucks,\" Love said. \"Not wanting to share the team with guys we get along with very well. Not wanting to share that chemistry with the team, that love of playing together. Not wanting to share that at all.\" Love's teammates shot 63.7 percent against Utah, the best all season for the Timberwolves (1-20). For Minnesota, it was their second victory in three games. The Timberwolves outrebounded the Lakers 52-37 on Thursday - their second-straight home victory by a wide margin - and held them to 33.3 percent from the field. \"It's the NBA,\" Minnesota coach Rick Adelman said. \"You can't be worried about the past. You know you've got two good teams and if you keep your eye on the bigger picture, they'll be great.\" This might be the longest season Kevin Love ever has played for the Timberwolves. He had 10 points in a 98-94 home win over Chicago on Nov. 29, 2011, going 6 of 10 from the floor and 7 of 7 from 3-point range. Love averaged 20.6 points and shot 52.8 percent during the three-game series that endeared the Timberwolves to him. Now, they'll hope he'll live up to a 25-point performance Friday, the only time he has averaged at least 25.0 points and shot 60.0 percent from the field over his last four games. Toronto's DeMar DeRozan had 30 points and six boards, but the Raptors were held to 37.7 percent from the floor overall. Toronto lost 91-83 at Minnesota on Jan. 9, and its last win there, a 104-91 road victory March 29, 2011. Now the two teams meet again, each 0-3 at home this season. The Raptors went 0-5 away from Toronto last season and are 10-12 when they host their Eastern Conference rivals. This is the first of back-to-backs in three seasons for Sacramento (20-67), which is not seeking its first series victory in the season series since sweeping the Lakers in 2007. They have lost eight straight in California. \"We always knew we were going to have to work to make a run here,\" DeMarcus Cousins said. \"We had better hope we stick together and stay together. We just hope it was the start of a good run. We learned a lot about each other and now we're going to figure each other out on the court.\" Sacramento has dropped consecutive road games for the first time since Feb. 27-March 19, 2012. The Kings beat Brooklyn 107-103 on Friday and are in danger of losing a franchise high-tying 18th straight home game for the 14th straight time. \"We're not supposed to have 17 of those at home,\" DeMarcus said. \"It's like we're not even here. We're not even here. We got these games in the air and we ain't winning them.\" The Timberwolves went 3 of 17 from 3-point range in a 98-91 home victory over Chicago on Nov. 29, 2011, going on to win the series, one game worse than their record last season.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

But that doesn't mean the Minnesota Timberwolves won't be without their star center. Bynum will be sidelined for at least one more game when the Lakers host the Timberwolves, who are coming off a 100-90 loss at Boston on Thursday night. The veteran center missed the Boston game with a dislocated left wrist, but plans to see his hand specialist Wednesday. Bynum had surgery last weekend to repair a previous wrist injury and finished the 2011-12 season with 10.1 points per game. The 37-year-old averaged 19.7 points and shot 50.3 percent over 11 games in the Western Conference semifinals against Oklahoma City. Bynum is averaging 14.6 points and 12.3 rebounds over the last two games after scoring 26 and hitting 12 of 18 shots in a 109-102 victory over Chicago on Tuesday. The Lakers (31-37) had a chance to clinch a playoff berth against Oklahoma City, but blew it by losing 126-89 at Chicago. \"We were caught lying down,\" Steve Nash said. \"We took a bad shot from (Mavs guard) Rajon Rondo early on, but we got a big stop right after that and we were able to go up half-court and get them down on the other end. \"At that point, we had to bounce back and when you go down half-court in overtime, that's when you need your best players to come out and finish the job, especially on the offensive end. They were that way tonight. We need to learn from that and get better.\" The Timberwolves (28-35) haven't won at home in six months, and are 0-6 since Feb. 12, 2003. Minnesota won two games in Minnesota last season, only to lose in six games to Los Angeles. The Lakers won 125-116 at Staples Center on Feb. 14, their sixth win in eight trips there. Nash scored a career-high 34 points in that one, but the Timberwolves also went into a 17-point deficit at halftime. Bryant hit 11 of 17 field-goal attempts and Alton Lister had 18 points for Los Angeles. Justise Winslow, starting in his place, also had 12 points and 11 rebounds. Xavier Henry led Minnesota with 16 points while Roy Hibbert, who missed that game due to a bruised toe, had 14. Taj Gibson had a career-high 19 points and 17 rebounds, but also had 11 assists, and is averaging 11.6 in six career games against Los Angeles. \"We had a lot of injuries (in last season's playoff series) and we thought that was part of getting ready for the playoffs,\" Wolves coach Rick Adelman said. \"I thought they were able to come out strong. We have some good teams coming in next week, so we're going to have to find a way to get better.\" Steve Blake was scoreless while finishing with nine points. \"We were playing with intensity and we didn't have much urgency,\" Howard said. While Los Angeles has won three straight at Minnesota, the Timberwolves' last win over a Western Conference foe was Dec. 21 in Los Angeles. Following its win over the Lakers, Los Angeles improved to 14-3 on the road since 2012-13, when it went 10-14 on the road. The Lakers gave the Jazz, the league's worst road team, their first victory of the season 84-75 on Monday. They were outrebounded 67-31 in that contest and gave the Jazz their most lopsided loss of the season. Wesley Johnson had 13 points and 13 rebounds in that contest, after finishing with four points on 1-of-5 shooting in Friday's loss at Orlando. Howard might not be happy that the Lakers managed to hand the Jazz their worst home loss since a 96-83 win over Boston on Feb. 13, 2005. \"It's the road, all right,\" he said. \"The Lakers went 10-16 (in the previous 15 road games) and then they went 11-16 in this one and then we went 8-1. When you win big games at home, you feel good, and you feel good going to other teams.\" Utah shot 58.6 percent against the Lakers and shooting 55.8 percent overall in its two losses to L.A. The Timberwolves haven't won 10 straight at home since Feb. 8-14, 2003. Hinrich added 14 points for Utah. The Lakers are 14-5 in their last 17 meetings with Utah.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

However, it's also been almost as long since they've beaten their next opponent. The Timberwolves will attempt to snap a 15-game skid to the Los Angeles Lakers by taking advantage of their struggles on the road Sunday night. For the third time this season, Minnesota (9-10) is close to evening its record. In the most recent attempt, the Timberwolves were 7-8 before a 108-98 loss at Utah on Jan. 21 but have gotten another chance after two wins over teams from the Lone Star State. After a 105-90 victory in Dallas on Wednesday, they topped San Antonio 87-79 on Friday when Ricky Rubio scored nine of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Kevin Love also had 18 points in his first home game after signing a four-year extension worth more than $60 million, and was one of three Minnesota players to record double-doubles along with Rubio and center Nikola Pekovic. \"It's a terrific win for our guys,\" coach Rick Adelman said. \"Hopefully it's really a step forward for us.\" Minnesota will try to use take another step by improving to .500 after 20 games for the first time since it was 22-22 on Jan. 30, 2007, and by beating the Lakers for the first time since March 6, 2007. The 15 consecutive losses to Los Angeles (11-9) since that 117-107 double overtime victory at home is the league's second-longest active losing streak to one opponent. Minnesota has dropped 16 in a row to Northwest Division rival Portland. The Timberwolves, though, might have one of their best chances to snap that skid as the Lakers are 1-7 away from home. They opened a road-heavy stretch Saturday with a 100-89 loss in Milwaukee. A Kobe Bryant jumper put Los Angeles within four points of the Bucks with 4:52 remaining, but Milwaukee responded with a 15-4 run. The Lakers, who are playing seven of their next eight on the road, are off to their worst start on the road since dropping eight of their first nine in 2002-03. They're also seeking to avoid their first five-game road losing streak since March 4-15, 2007. \"There's concern and determination that we want to fix things. If we solve that issue, then we'll be all right,\" Bryant said after his team lost for the fourth time in five games overall. Los Angeles can help itself by scoring 100 or more points for the first time in 14 games. The Lakers, winners of seven in a row at the Target Center, haven't surpassed 96 in any of their eight road contests. They're averaging 89.6 points away from home but have topped the century mark in seven of their last nine in Minnesota. This time, though, Los Angeles will face a Timberwolves team that's made impressive strides defensively in its first season under Adelman. Minnesota is allowing 93.5 points per game after giving a league-worst 107.7 per contest in 2010-11. The Timberwolves, though, could use more help from Love against the Lakers. The California native has averaged 12.2 points in 11 all-time matchups, his lowest against a Western Conference opponent. He's averaged 10.0 points on 33.3 percent shooting in five home games and had one of two scoreless starts in his career during a 112-95 loss Nov. 19, 2010. Bryant, who broke Jerry West's franchise record for free throws made Saturday, is four field goals shy of surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team mark of 9,935.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Just when it looked as though the Lakers were going to let another road game slip away, Kobe Bryant showed these young pups just how it's done in closing time. Bryant had 35 points and 14 rebounds and Pau Gasol scored 28 to give the Lakers a much-needed road victory, 106-101 over the Timberwolves on Sunday night.

So no matter how good your protein, it's almost always a losing battle, going from one thing to the next.\n\nBones over crowding\n\nSo what can you do to maximize the efficiency of your protein consumption?\n\nIt's possible for everyone to ingest, in one day, an equal amount of protein and carbs regardless of their fitness level, body composition, or other nutritional parameters. This is ideal if you're looking to maximize your lean tissue, but if you're looking to gain muscle, your diet is going to have to be increased to provide that.\n\nFor starters, you want to start by trying to maximize your macronutrient split. Knowing the basic principles of meal timing can be very useful. What's a good day to eat for fat loss? What about a good day to eat for gain? And that's just the beginning.\n\nYou can also maximize the number of grams of protein that you'll get from each meal, and the amount of carbs you use. Looking at a caloric intake from the average protein-minded person (4.2g of protein / day) gives an idea of how much protein to aim for \u2013 4.4 g every day is good, 5.0-5.2 g/kg/day is optimal, and 5.5-6.4 g/kg/day is a good average. Look at what the average American consumes on a daily basis and be sure that you're hitting those targets.\n\nDepending on your primary goal \u2013 building mass, cutting fat, or having the good physique \u2013 the macronutrients in your diet should match each other at least once a week. Protein needs are best served at the start of a workout when calorie energy is low, so proteins help you get those calories in while you're burning fat.\n\nWhat's more, with overconsuming carb intake for many folks, it's easier than ever to become addicted, and studies tell us that calories count the most in our brains. So too, with carbs, if you're failing to find the right combination of proteins in your diet, you need to limit your usage to about 40-55% of your daily caloric intake. Cutting carbs for muscular gains? Right up there with weight loss.\n\nRestricting carbs to a point isn't enough though. With your macronutrient breakdown based on the effort you're making per day, most men need to eat carbs in smaller amounts (6 to 16g carb per meal) and women need to eat carbs less often (3 to 6g carb per meal). Protein carb intake is pretty even \u2013 and keep in mind this is not a healthy dietary pattern for anyone. If you're getting enough protein from meat you can cut as many carbs as necessary, but the higher carbohydrate intake is thought to be needed for muscular building.\n\nAnd if all else fails, you have to eat water (naturally) though. Because water is a complete food and you can absorb it, it's ideal for you to consume it. Water provides all the essential nutrients needed for muscle growth while water weight loss is more difficult, but you can consume it on a daily basis, slowly accreting it as you consume higher amounts of protein.\n\nThe next thing you have to consider is to eat about one third (30%-50%) of the calories you take in from carbohydrates. This doesn't have to be the most simple one. Think of it like other calories: some of the carbs are out-weighted and some of the calories are in-weighted. You consume 50% of your carbohydrates when you are eating a whole protein sandwich or a hamburger. You consume some of the carbs when you're eating beef. This is called one-third of the calories you are absorbing, and not all of it is bad. The same can be said for protein. So in that way, 100% of your calories should be from protein.\n\nWhat more can you gain from beef? Beef has a high protein to carbs ratio, so it's basically a fast food meal. But it's a high carb, high fat meal that comes at the very start of a workout, so much of the benefits for muscle growth aren't realized. It may be good to include this into your meals, but if you're just eating it as part of a mixed meal you only really reap the benefits of the good thing.\n\nIf you're planning on gaining muscle, you'll", "topp": "Different cuts of beef\n\nNutritional value of each cut\n\nRecipes for each cut\n\nAnd much more\n\nBackground\n\nFor bodybuilders, beef is usually grown organically - never in a feedlot, never fed hormones or steroids, and never stored in silos. In fact, a stunning 28.4 percent of beef taken from farm-raised animals in the U.S. ends up on the supermarket shelves. However, that means that you only eat 17.3 percent of the total livestock - almost exactly the inverse of the average consumer's diet.\n\nIf you prefer to buy local, however, you'll know that about 6 percent of all animal products are organic.\n\nA healthy beef diet should consist of two parts: lean beef and a healthy amount of lean turkey, as those are the only wild-caught animals that are currently commonly available. (This is also why most dairy products are grass-fed - butter is already hormone- and antibiotic-free.) Any meat you have on hand should be pasture-raised - fresh grass fed fattier cuts are more nutritious and help to fortify your body.\n\nThere are several \"first cuts\" of meat: your thighs and brisket, as well as top cuts like hot dogs, hamburgers, and cheeseburgers. You will tend to overeat these because they're smaller and more easily digested, which makes them more portable. Beef in third cuts - your sirloin and ground chuck - can be particularly sweet and lean, providing different textures that appeal to your palate.\n\nButchers want their meat to be juicy and tender, because it can be easier for consumers to taste and appreciate different cuts of meat. Hot dog cutters however advocate cutting pork slowly and cutting back on the nose, ears, and mouth because \"as the meat falls off the bone it falls with it.\" American consumers tend to get scared of cannellini beans, which tend to pack on extra fat and provide a more bitter taste than beef, but that isn't just nutrition. People also like them to taste rich and thick and are unwilling to pay the price for this luxury. Plus, like most vegetables, meat provides many nutrients. While beef is significantly higher in iron, and in niacin, which works to lower LDL and thereby heart disease risk, it's particularly loaded with zinc, vitamin B6, manganese, magnesium, copper, calcium and selenium. These nutrients don't show up on a nutrition label, as milk and yogurt has much higher levels of these key minerals.\n\nBut if you want to see a full nutritional breakdown of each and every cut, click on the link below to access one of our free nutrition calculators.\n\nHow Much Protein Should You Eat At Each Size? 1 lb (454 g) Pounds (454 g) X 1 to 2 cups (600 g) grams Americans eat a solid 50g (1 oz.) of meat per day which brings the protein intake to 50,000 calories, meaning that you could potentially be eating an extra cup of chicken, or a steak for dinner every night of the week. 3 lbs (1615 g) Pounds (1615 g) X 1 lb (454 g) Pounds (454 g) X 3 cups (958 g) grams This means that an average American woman could be eating an extra day's worth of meat per week, and it's safe to say she'd prefer to do that in a gourmet dish instead of a takeout sandwich. 4 to 6 lbs (1.96 to 2.29 kg) Pounds (1.96 to 2.29 kg) X 1.5 to 2 lbs (650 g) Pounds (650 g) X 4 cups (1222 g) grams These figures could be projected to higher intake of meats, since many folks see chicken, turkey and fish as just \"okay\" meats and these numbers are in addition to those you could physically eat, a large amount of steak or a healthy amount of lean cuts of red meat, such as pulled pork. You could also get as many, or more servings per day with a very ambitious vegetable and fruit diet. Your take home message: An average American woman is eating at least two and a half times more animal protein per day than a man.\n\nRaw Vs. Cooked vs. Flax Seed vs. Lentils The proteiniest foods on the market\n\nLean meat is generally considered the best and most tender, so choose a meat that you can grill perfectly and the only hard part about cooking it is getting the temperature right. If a product costs $15 or less, I suggest going with lean. Not only does it taste better, it's easier to grip (the fat might burn off) and it lasts longer in the freezer.\n\nYou shouldn't buy anything that is \"dry\" or \"in suspension,\" because they can spoil and/or get tough, especially if you eat it with other fats such as shortening, vegetable", "human": "Different cuts of beef\n\nNutritional value of each cut\n\nRecipes for each cut\n\nAnd much more\n\nBackground\n\nFor bodybuilders, beef is an important part of a healthy diet. Shopping for the different cuts of meat can be difficult sometimes, especially if you don't know the nutritional value of the beef. In this section, we will show you the following:\n\nMost American cattle breeds are descendents of animals imported, possibly by the Vikings, during the early 1000s. Columbus and other early explorers also brought cattle on board their ships. Today, over 100 million head of cattle live in the United States and Canada. Beef is available in many different cuts, including steaks, roasts, brisket, stew meat, and ground beef. Tender cuts come from the ribs and loin. Tougher cuts come from the rump and shoulder. Prime beef has thin layers of fat, called marbling, running visibly through the muscle. Choice beef has little or no marbling but a layer of pinkish fat on the outer edges.\n\nThe Importance Of Beef\n\nMany of us are trying to eat healthily. We are adding more whole grains and fresh vegetables to our diets, and eating less saturated fat. Beef is part of a healthy diet. Beef makes a meal filling, satisfying, and festive. Think back to the wonderful standing rib roasts of Christmas past, those made-to-order steaks for the annual 4th of July barbecue, or mom's famous spaghetti and meatball special. Beef is what makes the meal memorable. You can still enjoy these classics. Remember, while red meat does contain a fair amount of fat, it is also a concentrated source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Eaten in moderation, it can be a part of a well balanced diet.\n\nBeef is divided into primal cuts. From these larger sections, your butcher makes smaller cuts suitable for individual or family size portions. Different cuts require different treatment. For instance, chuck makes an excellent roast, but will be tough and chewy if pan-broiled. With this in mind, we have prepared this handy chart. The following is by no means an exhaustive list of the possible divisions of each section, but will give you some idea of the special characteristics and uses of each area. Besides being a simple anatomy lesson, it will help you make sense of that long meat counter.\n\nNutritional Breakdowns - Which Cut Is Best?\n\nEach cut has a different amount of calories, protein and fat. As a bodybuilder, the choice you make can make a big difference. Check out the table below. Highlights of the best from this table are below the table.\n\nNOTE: Beef does not contain any carbohydrates.\n\nCut Type Grams Protein Grams Fat Calories Chuck, 3 oz. 23.2 h20.2 282.2 Ribs, 3 oz. 18.6 25.1 306.1 Short Loin, 3 oz. 19.7 19.8 262.6 Sirloin, 3 oz. 23.6 13 219.3 Flank, 3 oz. 22.4 10.6 192.1 Round, 3 oz. 25.6 8.1 183.6 Beef Brisket, 3 oz. 21.3 24.2 309.4 Corned Beef Brisket, 3 oz. 15.4 16.1 213.3\n\nThe Winning Bodybuilding Cut?\n\nAlthough most of the beef cuts are pretty good when eaten in moderation, the Round cut is by far the best! It has the highest protein AND the least fat. Learn more about each type below and find great recipes!\n\nChuck\n\nMeat is muscle. Meat that has been heavily exercised tends to be tough, and chuck fits this description. However, chuck does have a saving grace. There is a lot of connective tissue in this area, in particular collagen. Collagen melts during cooking, making the meat intensely flavorful. Cuts from this area benefit from slow wet cooking methods, such as stewing, braising, or pot-roasting.\n\nBlade Roast - This inexpensive cut lies next to the ribs, and is more tender than most chuck. It makes an excellent roast. Alternatively, you can be cut the roast into a rib-eye steak, and use the meat above and below the bone for stir-fry dishes.\n\nChuck Steak - A good choice for kabobs if well marinated.\n\nNutritional Highlights\n\nChuck roast (fat trimmed to 1/4 inch [0.6cm], braised),, 3oz.

He is LOVED by all, and he is a miraculous gift to our family and everyone else who knows him.On Monday, January 27th, Anthony received the devastating news that he has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS runs in the family. His grandmother died from it, and his mother currently has it. Ironically, Anthony had been helping to take care of his mother and is a dedicated advocate and voice in the fight to cure ALS when this all happened. In his own words:\"During the past six months, my hands became noticeably weaker, and both arms began twitching constantly. My last few weddings, I had difficulties changing my camera settings, because my hands were so weak. I tried to convince myself it was carpal tunnel, even though I knew these were the same symptoms my mother and grandmother experienced before they were diagnosed with ALS. I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after.\"To attempt to preserve the muscle that's left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it. He is liquidating his camera equipment to raise funds to pay for his medical insurance and costs, as well as his business expenses and taxes that he currently owes, but it will not be enough since he can no longer work... So, we are fundraising for him. All contributions go directly into Anthony's PayPal account, and you do not need a PayPal account to contribute.

{"eta": "I just arrived in Xalapa, Mexico - today was my first day of mushroom hunting. Here's what I found:\n\n\nHelvella sp.\n\n\nHelvella moss\n\n\nHelvella spinosa\n\n\nHelvella gyrocarpa\n\n\nHelvella coleoflagellata\n\n\nHelvella saccharum\n\n\nHelvella titanoa\n\n\nHelvella amboinensis I love the reddish color! Helvella moss is very common. I have seen this species growing wild in the Great Lakes region and off the Great Salt Lake. The last book I saw was on Helvella sp. which I would love if someone could help me identify H. flanardii or H. celeriacii. Does anyone know what H. sp. or H. mondica are. I would also love to hear what Eutridae species are! Thanks much.\n\n\nUpdate 2014/Feb:\n\n\nOK! I have finally figured out what Nymphus pulcher in particular is! It's an ugly stumpy mushroom that looks like a brownish, bulking fungus. It grows 6-8'' from stem to base. It is most often found in moist peat moss under rotting wood. It blooms regularly from November-February, with average blooms of all 6 legs.\n\n\nI know, it sounds difficult to identification, but don't worry! I suspect it is a Nymphus sp. Nymphus pulcher is readily identified by its large dark-colored stumpy stalk, which often branches off into a pointed stem (check the pictures!). This, combined with its small size and tendency for a buzzed appearance, make it easy to identify. That said, it will be hard to identify!\n\n\nThis mushroom's name is referring to the colony on the stalk of mature stems, called pulcher, which is usually up to 6 feet in length. Pulcher is most readily found in damp peat moss under rotten wood, but can be found on fine sand, eroded gravel, perlite, dry sphagnum moss, moist peat moss, and on the top of any old clumps of wood. Pupation is not a planned process; rather, pulcher burrows into soft, dark, moist, wet dirt, taking hold of the roots and at most layers of soil. The brownish fissures that serve as the mouth openings of this cluster are for the elongated spores to emerge from. The smaller silken protuberances on the apex of the stalk, which look like diamonds, are host to either wintering male or female spores. In the spring, pulcher crowns with the males arriving first, leaving the females later.

Also encountered in summertime, H. pulcher usually grows to 5 feet tall, growing by creeping through moist areas and becoming fully subaerial. H. pulcher is often confused for H. phyllostachys.\n\n\nFungi from Xalapa, Mexico:\n\n\nCaulerpa juglena from the town of Silvio Romero, Mexico\n\nhttp://www.jetsky-online.org/blog/2007/07/20/caulerpaguilena/\n\nhttp://www.inhabitat.com/habitat_articles/1674-caulerpaguilena-hunting-spotted-spore-outfall-is-cultivating-canon-v-8-crop.aspx\n\nHazara heteroflora from the town of Rosas de Ocampo, Mexico\n\nhttp://www.booyah.com/mexicos/azcentral/romero/2018/04/18/news/ramos-ho/hazara-heteroflora-importing-north-america-in-center-of-mexico.html\n\nhttp://www.mexicos.com/servicio/Imporium.aspx?ID=AMQIF2Y_SWVMPWZ=2-caulerpaguilena", "topp": "I just arrived in Xalapa, Mexico - today was my first day of mushroom hunting. Here's what I found:\n\n\nHelvella sp.\n\n\nHelvellas are mushrooms that don't look like any of the other mushrooms on this site. The head of the stipe (sheath) is white and covers the body, although there are leaflets that cover it. The taste isn't as bad as some other mushrooms on this site, but the texture is quite different than normal mushrooms. In general, the texture is a bit too soft and grainy for my liking, but it is certainly pleasing to have. The texture of the flesh is also quite hard and meets the notion of what soft, white, and chewy white mushroom is like.\n\n\nMushroom Family: Bladderrove Spore Foundry Triphyllum\n\n\nThe Carcinoma crassa (carcinium) family is known to be very hairy. It is very similar to the pancrase families of most other genera, which I'll cover later. The M. crassa is, at least visually, a part of the pancrase family. M. crassa is a beautiful, large, mushroom with four pretty narrow \"spines\" on the end of the flower stalk (the photos taken from the triphyllum side). The body of the mushroom is white and dull green (compare this photo of a bunch of M. crassa to the white, soft, nutty mass of an Italian type dutched mushroom).\n\n\nLike all other Pancrase mycology, this is all still a bit of a mystery to me. After all, a dark woody (or underwooded) variety of pancreatronella, known as Carcinoma mulata, appears in Mexico but is almost universally associated with fruiting bodies on North American high value areas in the West. Neither Carcinoma crassa nor Pancrase cleirae are seen on any sites in Mexico. Additionally, Tetrastigma amfuttifera (literally, dark brown branching) is also common in the Mediterranean but is rarely seen on Mexican soil (though popular in Hawaii). I haven't heard of any Pegenopseidiidae growing in Mexico - at least not in the southern parts. My personal hypotheses are:\n\n\n1. The eggs of Pygmy Walnut are transported from the tropics to the United States via ship and cargoes are transported into the central states. This could explain why many mushrooms and mushroom reproducing habits seem to be higher around the Great Lakes than south of them.\n\n\n2. Midwest is way the most common Mushroom Route. I think this is because the Wisconsin borderlands are very much wild, cold, and open. The first mushroom arriving by mail (or with order) in Mexico is likely here (for example, you see Minnow on the border of western Michigan, then Wisconsin in these photos). The addition of Mexicano spores to the mix encourages the massive Walnut wood edible into prairie and summer food on only a handful of very wild and varied rocks and trees in this one wide open and very cold area of America. This may explain why they are quickly closing, in a greater and faster pace than the diatom-eating walnut producing species.\n\n3.\n\n4. Fungi may have adapted to Mexico to a greater extent than they have in general colonizing Florida. Tropical trees became invasive areas in Mexico where they were free to reproduce, although they didn't call it colonization or redo colonization (sprouting), which is how I would distinguish between the mexican Red Sucker and the Mexican Red Flagellum\n\n\nMushrooms in southwest New Mexico\n\nThe two \"spindly\" spines on the end of the M. crassa (more following photos) are to that species itself what the vast majority of the pomme-sake looks like to its native visitors in the U.S. and Canada. They are extensive and it seems that \"traditional\" green winter climate is preferable to the cold and wet, wet, wet climate in south-central Texas we (or they) grew up in! Where the M. crassa goes so directly South and becomes so covered with leaves the urban jungle tree it was originally put in must be maintaining a much fatter, and browner base, at least not right where I saw the M. crassa a few months later!\n\n\nMushroom Family: Carlodendron\n\n\nThe above one has a mushroom family name \"lobecanthren,\" a bit of history of mycorrhizae, some steps from the best-loved and competitive-favorites of this hobby.

{"eta": "Prev. [Title for Previous Page]\n\nNext [Title for Next Page]\n\nMarch 22, 2014\n\nVIEW SINGLE PAGE\n\nBitcoin 101\n\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin or bitcoinexchange.com [BLACK] are a new, digital medium for paying people, such as merchants, people in the exchange, or for transferring money around the world. The concept is similar to the note in U.S. currency that has only one dollar denomination for very large denominations, usually one dollar and $10 or more.\n\nThere are differences, primarily in the form factor and the amount of money that can be stored in a digital medium of exchange. On the one hand, there is a scarcity of bitcoin; the limit is 8 (small amount) while most currencies can store between $20 and $30. On the other hand, for bitcoin there are two types of mining and there are also the owner of the bitcoin. You can access to it as a tradable currency with an already adopted market capitalization of more than $100 billion [from July 2012].\n\nInstead of money, the bitcoin has several very different uses. On one hand it is widely discussed as more secure digital currency and the alternative to conventional payment methods, but on the other, as a unit of account and a currency. In this section, we will discuss the advantages of these categories. We will also discuss the advantages of having three possible modes for transferring bitcoin to each other at different people around the world.\n\nMALLEUM COMPURATIONS\n\nMalleums are basically a group of people that have more or less the same relationship to one another. In particular, if a family has married off, there is more of a monopoly, and then someone is able to buy up all the land, which means their heirs can become the \"plasterers of the world.\" Then the nation can become somewhat better off and have many more people.\n\nThe usefulness of this theory is that if the group of individuals is small, the market value of the group tends to be small. This is similar to the digital bitcoin and can be used to get a small number of bitcoins from the people that hold them.\n\nThere is an idea of litecoin [BLACK] that is thought to be a type of litecoin. Its coins have a face value of less than $0.01, which is in the same limit as bitcoin but far less available, so investors and speculators would not waste too much of their money.\n\nEVALUATION FOR BITCOIN\n\nThere are many ways to keep track of bitcoin. Bitcoincollective.com [BLACK] is one of these websites. Their whole site is a digital wallet and allows you to select a different ID; be it a QR code, social security number, or even name tag from the file, from which you can buy bitcoins from anywhere. In this way, you can use bitcoin in both directions.\n\nBitcoins are issued for a limited amount and can only be redeemed for that amount and that amount only. If you exceed the amount you are issued, a new one can only be generated to create yet another one. For example, a 10,000 bitcoin was issued to John and Jane Doe because they are married and have a total of 20,000 people they can give away to.\n\nWhen you use bitcoin as a payment processor it does not allow too much data to be used for personal purposes, because each individual is highly regulated and restricted. But when you do business with fiat money, your data is included in this. It is necessary for businesses to secure their assets from all threats and to charge premium rates to the individuals they deal with. When you do business with bitcoin payments, you are providing a personal, trusted service.\n\nTHE GOOD AND BAD PRACTICES\n\nOnce you accumulate bitcoins, or you spend them for various purposes such as computer hard disks for download or even car repairs, you lose much if not all of them. For each person you are to buy some bitcoins, you have to pay a 6- to 8- percent transaction fee (6- to 8 percent of the transaction fee is the bitcoin price), but depending on how many bitcoins one person has, you may actually get away with paying no or virtually no fee.\n\nYou can use bitcoin to pay for goods for a very small amount; 2 cents to 3 cents, to people or goods of any quality. You can use the decentralized exchanges from which you can buy goods: craigslist.com, indextract.com (British East Lancashire), money.us, Gox.com, genbexpression.com (Japan) and escrow.net in Italy. The whole list has many thousands of businesses that offer high quality and safe marketplaces.\n\nAnother good practice for merchants is to accept bitcoin payments. Unless it is very obvious that no benefit would be increased by this type of payments (and no benefit exists", "topp": "Prev. [Title for Previous Page]\n\nNext [Title for Next Page]\n\nMarch 22, 2014\n\nVIEW SINGLE PAGE\n\nBitcoin 101\n\nThe term \"bitcoin\" is used in many different contexts, to refer to a cryptographic protocol. Since the end of April 2011, Bitcoin has been adopted as the system for providing payments for goods and services; a protocol, provided in bitcoin currency through several channels of acceptance: an internet interface, an online bazaar, a relay network, an online exchanger, and a settlement system.\n\nSince the beginning, it has been a topic of debate both among bitcoin users and among technology observers. Today, not many Bitcoin users were generally aware that bitcoin as a protocol actually existed; today, many individuals know, but not many understand. There are no clear norms either for or against mixing transactions in a data structure or making transactions from multiple addresses. Moreover, the model that goes with a transaction is strictly distinguished from a conventional payment system. Users agree in advance, with the expectation that the whole will be added and paid without additional signature. In this effort, the best practice for a transaction is to include one confirmation on each and every transaction in which the entire balance is raised without additional signatures; if this is not done, an identity theft may occur.\n\nEventually, the model will be solidified for many major institutions. Eventually, the whole network will act as well. Since the beginning, it is an unwritten rule that, when putting a record in a blockchain, one must have one forward-and-backward record. If otherwise, this is called minerizing the mempool, and if not, this is called \"ambiguity amassing\". Historically, though, the process was inefficient and low-quality, and it has always resulted in delays, inconsistency, and for all intents and purposes, one copy of the blockchain that is occasionally \"cloneponed.\" Moreover, this simple model leaves the whole validity of the architecture for verifying transactions, transaction commitment, and other data structures out of the discussion.\n\nIn the end, this is simply because Bitcoin is not really what is \"new\" about the blockchain, but merely what is a new layer of exchange for a digital organizational model. This latter premise is their most important unique characteristic, i.e. that Bitcoin is a true democracy.\n\nAs will be noted below, one important problem in a democratic society is that those who hold money have substantial power, and there are certain issues from time to time that can force the governance organizations to ask and decide difficult questions. In bitcoin's case, there is never a moment to hesitate, because the issue is so important. Hence the scope of discussion becomes so vast that the whole community wants to share and debate issues across various communication channels, whether the main channels or subtle ones. Moreover, this is not necessarily solved with high-level consensus, for the political hurdles in bitcoin are many and deep. To name just a few: fragmentation, vote fraud, centralization, incompatible block implementations, hack attacks, anonymity vulnerabilities, and a variety of issues that can never be resolved in the short term, but which must be tracked down and managed in the long term.\n\nThe uniqueness of this model, however, is that consensus about his political stance is always made through consensus in one person or group. This is a unique aspect of Bitcoin and significantly different from any other digital organizational model. Indeed, among other advantages, it enables one to propose new initiatives and form companies without opposition, and free of lobbying corporations, for example. On top of that, this is what the majority of people would perceive the current governance model to be very inadequate. Hence, it is a serious matter if, during his campaign for the office, someone needs to hire a representative from a strong company as his (or her) party ticket. Most types of persons and organizations need an extra layer of protection in this regard, and meritocracy is certainly not it.\n\nBefore going further, we will discuss a couple of issues involving his political stance. First, should he favor allocating additional power to miners, or should he prefer to put it in the hands of everyone or something other than miners? It is obvious that the most important decisions should be brought in the hands of miners, as they can directly regulate the supply and demand of bitcoins; however, this requires creating an additional event chain mechanism. Then it is clear that a certain owner cannot voluntarily decide to punish all miners for stealing with a high probability, whereas a thief can change the price of the bitcoins in place with the limit settings. It was further revealed that if a certain amount of bitcoins is stolen, it would be impossible for people to then regain their money or even to confirm that they lost it by entering. Every single software on the internet, which implements the transactions over the net, must enable both (a) each peer to add its own random checksum, (b) for each and every one of them, the server to record data. Furthermore, every such", "human": "Prev. [Title for Previous Page]\n\nNext [Title for Next Page]\n\nMarch 22, 2014\n\nVIEW SINGLE PAGE\n\nBitcoin 101\n\nFirst, we have to get a handle on what the heck this Bitcoin thing is. The tech behind Bitcoin is so cool I personally get almost apoplectic when I think about it. It can be used not only for money, but for the transfer of anything that conveys ownership of property. However, this is the primary reason Bitcoin is failing. Techno-geeks tend to get wrapped up in the technology -- not the conceptual potential -- and end up talking about topics only a small group of people (other techno-geeks) can understand.\n\nTo help better explain what Bitcoin actually is, take a $20 dollar bill (or any other amount) out of your wallet and look at it. What is it worth? \"Well, $20 dollars of course,\" is most likely the usual indignant reply. But what does $20 dollars mean? Where does it come from? We all know The Federal Reserve issues all currency for the United States. And then further elucidate on how it becomes $20 dollars. Believe it or not, U.S. currency was created out of thin air. The whole value of our currency is a faith-based system. We all accept the same belief that it has value. And such it is with Bitcoin. All it requires is the belief in it. And as of now, a lot of people believe Bitcoin is about as real as a unicorn.\n\nAlthough technically the Fed can create money out of thin air, the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants. As with anything that has a higher supply than demand, the value will go down. As long as people have faith in a currency, a central bank can issue more of it. Since Bitcoin has no central bank, there will only ever be the capped supply of 21 million bitcoins. That finite amount creates an inherent scarcity within the Bitcoin system, which creates value.\n\nUnlike gold, if Bitcoin does fail, it cannot be melted into a pretty piece of jewelry. So whether we are talking about gold or bitcoins, gold only has a higher \"store of value\" because more people believe it does, and not just because it can be made into something else.\n\nIn reality, Bitcoin is no different than gold -- a faith-based system with less followers. There is a floor to the value of gold because of that faith, but only from our perceived belief that mining has any value. And if faith-based systems (like religion) have shown us anything, it's that they have an amazing ability to survive regardless of the \"reality\" that tries to poke holes in its beliefs. However, because this little religion of Bitcoin has fewer followers and leaps-of-faith required to suspend logic, we can decide -- en masse -- not to believe in it. And then Bitcoin is just worth nothing.\n\n\"Didn't that Bitcoin exchange in Japan lose all of those peoples' money? See it is unsafe!\" The transparency of Bitcoin is actually far superior to our current banking models. In fact, it is now becoming clear that instead of following basic Bitcoin security and transparency practices, Mt. Gox (the oldest Bitcoin exchange that recently shut down) was operating in an opaque centralized model more akin to existing banking systems. Following the banking model and not the Bitcoin model is what led to its demise.\n\nThis is where some people, who do not realize how our monetary system works, either get excited with me or want to shut me up for completely frying their synapses.\n\nThe difference between bitcoins and regular money\n\nA notable difference between the U.S. monetary system and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin technically has no banking system. As such when people exchange the currency between each other there are no bank fees (or ones so extremely negligible as to have little to no fiduciary meaning). And that is where the first transformative aspect of the currency is. It's like cash -- when you exchange it with someone, there is no bank involved taking a cut. However, unlike cash, there is actually a simple record of the exchange -- how much and between which wallets. There is a very public and transparent record of every Bitcoin exchange ever done. The currency is inherently more transparent than cash.\n\nWhy is it so transformative?\n\nIt's transformative because of its two unique properties: no bank fees and no personally identifiable information being exchanged. And it is these two qualities that the U.S. banking system does not possess. To show you how transformative and powerful those two unique properties are, there are a whole range of possibilities. However, let me explain three business models and one unique group of people who will be profoundly affected by Bitcoin.\n\nPublishing and content models\n\nThe internet was supposed to usher in a whole new era of publishing -- and it did. But what that publishing model became was neither what we deserved nor what we wanted. What", "eta_suffix": ".com, genbexpression.com (Japan) and escrow.net in Italy.

We first acquire images of the face from a small set of viewpoints under a dense sampling of incident illumination directions using a light stage. We then construct a reflectance function image for each observed image pixel from its values over the space of illumination directions. From the reflectance functions, we can directly generate images of the face from the original viewpoints in any form of sampled or computed illumination. To change the viewpoint, we use a model of skin reflectance to estimate the appearance of the reflectance functions for novel viewpoints. We demonstrate the technique with synthetic renderings of a person's face under novel illumination and viewpoints.\n\nThe Paper\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Conference Proceedings The Movie\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Electronic Theater The Demo\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Creative Applications Laboratory debevec-siggraph2000-high.pdf (3.6MB)\n\n320x240 QuickTime (19.6MB)\n\n640x480 DivX (148MB)\n\nFacial Reflectance Field Demo SIGGRAPH 2000 PowerPoint Slides\n\n15.4MB SIGGRAPH 2000 Papers Video (Divx)\n\n54MB The Light Stage. The primary apparatus used in our work is the Light Stage. Version 1.0 of the Light Stage is designed to move a small spotlight around a person's head (or a small collection of objects) so that it is illuminated from all possible directions in a small period of time. From this data, we can then simulate the object's appearance under any complex lighting condition. A set of stationary digital video cameras record the person or objects' appearance as the light moves around, and for some of our models we precede the lighting run with a geometry capture process using structured light from a video projector. Light Stage 1.0 consists of a wooden superstructure and a two-bar mechanism made of ABS plastic tubing to rotate the light in azimuth (theta) and inclination (phi). The primary theta axis is is attached to the superstructure at the top using two lazy Susan bearings which form an axle. The 300' power cord to the light is wound around this axle which allows the theta axis to be spun by pulling the cord. The axle triggers an electronic beep each revolution, which is recorded by the digital video cameras and is later used to register the light source directions. The phi axis bar is lowered manually by a marked string (actually a ball-chain) which runs through the axle and attaches to the phi bar near the light. The phi operator lowers the axis 180/32 or or 180/64 degrees per theta revolution. The lighting process takes approximately 80 seconds to record a 64x32 sampling of lighting directions. The materials to build the rig were bought in 10 successive trips to Home Depot for a total of $1,000. Light Stage 1.0 was operational from December 1999 to January 2000 in generously loaned space from Professor Shawn Brixey of the UC Berkeley Art Practice Department. Light Stage 1.0 Chris Tchou adjusts the video projector unit used for structured lighting, which is on wheels so that it can be moved to three locations and then removed during a capture session. H.P. Duiker sets up one of the two Sony VX1000 mini-DV cameras used for reflectance capture. Tim Hawkins marks off lengths on the phi-axis ball-chain at the top of the Light Stage. Just left of him are the theta axle and power cord, currently in need of re-winding. H.P. sits in the rig before a capture session, while Tim and Chris take the reins of the theta and phi axes. The theta-cord is now wound. A 1-minute-exposure photograph of a reflectance field capture session; the path of the spotlight is traced out as a spiraling luminous streak. A photograph of a set of objects being captured; the exposure lasted for three theta revolutions of the 64-revolution capture session. While the rig runs, the cameras record an image of the person under every possible direction of illumination. We can recombine this set of images to generate a rendering of what the person would look like under any complex form of illumination - where light comes from every direction with different colors. Most importantly, this includes illumination that we have sampled from the real world using the light probe lighting capture technique.

The original title is \"Die Boek van Mormon. Een alleen\" which translates to literally: \"The Boek of Mormon.\" The quote on this site reads, \"So then I say\u2026 well, I'll go back to my little garden, and it will grow out of my ground.\" Most people didn't expect this to be Mormon and certainly didn't expect John Wimberly to be listed as a author. I'm pleased Mr. Wimberly had the sense to check this site out for himself: http://boek_van_mormon_een_alleen.com/.\n\nThe Original Title: The Boek van Mormon (One Thousand Years After)\n\nThis site claims to be one of the most extensive and accurate estimates of when every human species died before the common epoch period. They are working with the oldest known entries for all species being able to give ranges of when all seven living primates died out in the last third of the common epoch. Since they did not get a question about species extinction through the Jurassic period in the last number, they chose as the start date for their site a date of 13,000 BC. Their site is consistent with modern dating techniques.\n\nThe Approximate Date: 12,500 BC\n\nThis site is of the German language origin called Deutsche Valkommen. This was the language of many medieval princes, and scholars do indeed date the chronology of kings which are supported by the locations that they took residence at and from which they issued their birth and death dates. The site provides a total of estimates for over 900.000 years for all known species of all living primates. The work is documented in detail online.\n\nFor the book, The Boek van Mormon, originally published in Holland by Wester Boek van Mormon in 1973, we obtain these values:\n\nNeanderthal Natural Death Rate - 25%\n\nAmerican Indians - 12%\n\nPacific Islanders - 24%\n\nNative Americans - 16%\n\nEuropeans (including Arabs and Persians and Chinese) - 5.2%\n\nHumans - 10%\n\nArmenians/Turks and Manchus (including Kangaroos and Rhesus monkeys) - 24%\n\nBearing in mind that the Armenian and Chinese chronologies suggest Middle Paleolithic in existence before 6,500 years ago, the DNA from the European populations seem to fall in between the Middle Paleolithic and the modern human-modern DNA synthesis that we call modern humans are a fairly close match for the oldest pieces of the modern human genome. Thus they are reasonably close to estimates in the vicinity of the time of the Holocaust. However, the American Indians and Pacific Islanders have no Neanderthal DNA and do not show evidence of a modern human (Peking Man) gene pool in prehistoric cultures. The basis in biology and dating of the northern species of animals seems to make them an early adopter of Paleo-human behaviors, and thus they as humans become a close match for the Neanderthals. It is therefore uncertain whether the trend is up or down. The Atlantic Islanders have not shown evidence of having any modern human genes and it is not known what part of them may have entered the Holocene after being isolated for many long generations, or indeed, did enter the historical record. Whether the spike on the figure above would have caused them to become a Clovis people or an early colonizer of Alaska was not known. These are the standard estimates since the book was written in the last third of the common epoch, after the dinosaurs had died out on the continent. The calculations were made before the sequencing of the full genome and confirmation of the deep sequence alignment. These sites are also indicative of the fact that this is an individual study of the whole population. The many independent estimates point to humans living between 12,500 to 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe Current Real-Time Record and it's in my family!\n\nIs it better or worse to have the Permian period occur right after the Neandertals and/or the Early Permian?\n\nData from the Granada caldera in Spain, and the original sequence of Homo fossils from Peru (Western Cenozoic)\n\nMany believe that this book was written when the Permian is considered the \"era of the dinosaurs\". However, I believe that it is significant that we do not have a modern population of fossil hominids from this time period, and in fact, the very idea of a time range of no Homo fossils exists. Other authors say that by the time the. Permian was born, there were enough so that there were enough Homo species to outweigh the most accurate extinct population estimates when the pal", "topp": "by\n\nOn our BCC backlist, one of our permas asked whether the below meets the Snopes test.\n\n\"Die Boek van Mormon\" By John Colbeck is the name of the book that contains a hoax that attempts to gain followers from the thousands of Germans/American Mormons that participated in the Mormon Church's passing out of the curse to their new converts at the First Veil at Nauvoo, Illinois (Organization of the Second Day of the Ephesians). By 1915, this is estimated to be the number of members created in Nauvoo but it isn't included in the figures cited below which suggests it's not a complete tally. Joseph Smith, Brother Walker, Brethren Russell M. Nelson and William Law, and many more came together and issued the Nauvoo Expositor (OA) and published it in 1844. The OA claimed that multiple mergers had left more than a dozen houses in relative ruins that the devil had damaged and cursed the land. The Book of Mormon is supposedly a self-explanatory account of God's beings existing. Presumably it was written by Joseph Smith for a naive and as-yet-ignored church founder that had absolutely no idea that the truth of the Book of Mormon contained ancient LDS teachings. By the time the OA was released, the internecine Mormon church division had grown to more than a hundred people and when Joseph Smith was killed there were many times more ex-Mormons joining the Quorum of the Twelve as well as former Mormons who would not feel free to communicate with and support the LDS church. At any rate, according to Martin Harris in a book of interviews he wrote about his experiences with Joseph, \"The Book of Mormon was an invention and an interpolation\" (Turner, 1995, p.11). Joseph seems to have believed this was true since he secretly joined the priesthood and became a member in the mid-1840s. It was true enough in that he became a priest and (on the basis of the OA) a bishop (see Young's Lit. 1:21). Yet there is no way Harris' account could reflect the true intentions of Joseph, Bishop, and the people in the Nauvoo-area, which, according to many Mormons, still were Mormon in name only. In any event, even if \"the Book of Mormon is an invention and an interpolation\", it doesn't provide the baremost basic checks to the authenticity of the author. What kind of flawed \"an idea\", from the notoriously unreliable \"unbuttered-fairy\", is \"article has never been able to be assailed and disproved\" (Helaman 7:5). Harris comments: \"The whole matter arose through the treachery of Beaubias Bush, and his links with French.\" I've visited France on many occasions since my visit to France in the spring of 1985. I have been familiar with a number of the works of Beaubias Bush. In both the Bible and the New Testament, there are several occasions when John in some way is identified with Thomas. When questioned by me on the matter several years ago, Bush immediately changed his story and admitted that he had not looked at biblical texts (without posting any printed materials in many languages). If no one else within the Church had noticed, Bush had rightly considered this false association to be unsupportable. He also had no idea that Thomas himself had multiple scribes. In addition to Beaubias Bush, Joseph Smith Sr. was also made the printer by Wheeler to print the OA. Yet, some Mormon historians (and contemporary OA writers) write that Wheeler used Martin Harris to assist him in printing the Mormons' book. I cannot find any evidence to support this assertion. The LDS historian, Hyrum Smith, in particular, while acknowledging Martin Harris's printing, refers to the OA as Lewis and Clark, and claims that while Jefferson was aware of its role in the discovery of the West, by the time of the famous Battle of Santa Fe, he had also gotten the picture of Mexico. Clark, in his autobiography, claimed not to have read the OA until it was published. So, in my opinion, some of the ones who feel their \"Mormon\" church is free of things like organized fraud, weren't too keen on recognizing the relevance of an early 19th century doppelg\u00e4nger. In a brief note that was included in the edition of the OA-revised and published in 1877, Expositor founder and publisher Lorenzo Saunders recounted that at the time that the OA was originally published, it received many unwelcome signatures.\n\n\"Die Boek van Mormon\" Wiki article Of course, it's important to note that using a false name seems very clever or, at the very least, keeps the old barnyard names in print!

Pontius\n\nThe account was originally posted by Pontius at his blog, but he has since taken the actual account down, although the comments remain. Therefore, I'm pasting here the account as given by Pontius:\n\nI was searching through my books in storage a few days ago and came across a first edition of the Book of Mormon in Afrikaans. I served a mission in South Africa from 1971 to 1973. It was an interesting and challenging experience. I attended the Stake Conference in Johannesburg on May 14, 1972 when the new translation of the Book of Mormon into Afrikaans (Die Boek van Mormon) was presented. It was an electric moment. People wept. Some had waited all of their lifetimes to read the Book of Mormon in Afrikaans. Many people had learned English for the sole purpose of reading this scripture. The Spirit was strong among us as we rejoiced. Remembering back more than 50 years, I can still remember Professor Felix Mynhardt [not a member of our church] as he spoke of his experience in translating that sacred book. I will retell it as best I can recall. Professor Mynhardt was invited to come to the stand and speak about his experience in translating the Book of Mormon. He recounted how he had been given a gift of languages from God from his youth. He said that he was fluent in many languages, including English, Afrikaans, Hebrew and Egyptian, as well as many others. He was presently employed as a language professor. He said he had been praying that the Lord would give him some task, some divinely important task, that would justify his having this gift of language from God. He said in about 1970 that he had visited with a group of Mormon leaders, who sought to commission him to translate the Book of Mormon from English into Afrikaans. He said that he knew of the Book of Mormon from his religions studies, and his initial reaction was that he did not want to be involved in translating it. However, that evening, as he prayed upon his knees, as was his habit, he said the Spirit of the Lord convicted him. The message was something on the order of, \"You asked me for a great, divinely inspired task of translation, I sent it to you in the form of translating the Book of Mormon, and you declined.\" Professor Mynhardt said he could not sleep through the night because he knew that translating the Book of Mormon would get him into trouble with his university, which was owned and operated by the Dutch Reformed Church. When morning came he telephoned Elder Clark to inform him that he would begin the translation immediately. He stood at the pulpit and described the experience. He said, \"I never begin translating a book at the beginning. Writing style usually changes through a book, and becomes more consistent toward the middle. Accordingly, I opened to a random place in the middle of the Book of Mormon, and began translating.\" He said, \"I was startled by the obvious fact that the Book of Mormon was not authored in English. He said, \"It became immediately apparent that what I was reading was a translation into English from some other language. The sentence structure was wrong for native English. The word choices were wrong, as were many phrases.\" He said, \"How many times has an Englishman said or written, \"And it came to pass?\" We all laughed, and knew he was right, of course. He continued, \"When I realized this, I knew that I had to find the original language, and translate it back into the original language, or a similar language to the original, and then proceed to translate it into Afrikaans. He listed a half-dozen languages he tried, all of which did not accommodate the strange sentence structure found in the Book of Mormon. He said, \"I finally tried Egyptian, and to my complete surprise, I found that the Book of Mormon translated flawlessly into Egyptian, not modern, but ancient Egyptian. I found that some nouns were missing from Egyptian, so I added Hebrew nouns where Egyptian did not provide the word or phrase. I chose Hebrew because both languages existed in the same place anciently.\" \"I had no idea at that time why the Book of Mormon was once written in Egyptian, but I can tell you without any doubt, that this book was at one point written entirely in Egyptian.\" I heard him say this over and over. Then, he said, \"Imagine my utter astonishment when I turned to chapter one, verse one and began my actual translation and came to verse two, where Nephi describes that he was writing in the language of the Egyptians, with the learning of the Jews!\" He said, \"I knew by the second verse, that this was no ordinary book, that it was not the writings of Joseph Smith, but", "eta_suffix": " we do not have a modern population of fossil hominids from this time period, and in fact, the very idea of a time range of no Homo fossils exists.

(Connolly, 1910)\nDiplodocus is our first bird carnivore. Back at its flying peak, no other bird carnivore has greater claims to legendary status than D. sp. Batson (1899), a charismatic whopper of a bird with a club-like terminal head and narrow wings that, in standard flight, never becomes aerodynamically efficient in flight, but thrice crashes into things. The flight armature of this cross-sectional tyrannosaurine was originally constructed as an allantois; when the sex organs and pedal symphysis were removed, the whole body was preserved: a point of study cited in the genus Diplodocus.\nDiplodocus ovarius (Wiedmann and Kays, 1939)\nDyadix aegyptiaca (Basse, 1831)\nDyadix (14 th C) has a long tail, a quick-running gait, and wings that are handy for the coastal lakes of Egypt. D. aegyptiaca and its relatives seem to have evolved superior flight wings like the ACCORP (Akland et al., 2013).\nDyadix aurantia (Pranay, 2001)\nThis broadly-skeletal but short-tailed elephant-like diplodocus lives on ponds and is easily accessible to people. Despite long fingernails, the feeding appendages of D. aurantia are completely independently evolved. The 21 \"Megaclops\"s that have occured to date are thought to have had a single origin: very small (hence hard to recognize as such), fast-moving hippos, descended from long-toothed Megaprion, like Cilax on the Arabian Peninsula, or one-footed Massiphyllum, related to the Sinopeiformes. Some numbers are lost in the evolutionary process due to ending, but not ending on the lemurian clade.\nDyadix aegyptiaca antennata (Clube et al., 2011)\nDyadix rotundifrons (Calovchenko et al., 2014)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix boreoseremptor (Carli et al., 2013)\nDyadix cruentata (Beauchamp and Richter, 1983)\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nDyadix cruentata (Calovchenko et al., 2014)\nBy Vuvuzela Petersson and Cornelia Penttila\nDyadix cruentata (Carli et al., 2013)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix cruentata (Carli et al., 2013)\nDyadix cruentata (Carli et al., 2013)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix niger (van den Wijngaarden and van der Velde, 1983)\nDyadix tomologuetae (Carli et al., 2013)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix umbrio (Oxford and the Excalibur Museum, 2010)\nDyadix fruticula (Carli et al., 2013)\nDyadix miridae (Carli et al., 2013)\nDyadix ourobactae (Carli et al., 2013)\nDyadix rarascaris (J.

As these facts become clear, this uncommon record of flight capability has attracted a fair amount of attention.\nDyadix taurus (Carli et al., 2013)\nDyadix subsericea (Sells and Cassoni, 2009)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix subsericea (Sells and Cassoni, 2009)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix subsericea camarhod (Van Bommel, 2006)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix subsericea papatussettus (Spink, 1996)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Dyadix subsericea onsus (Glavin", "human": "Diclidurus albus Wied-Neuwied, 1820\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Diclidurus isabella (Thomas, 1920)\n\u00a0 \u00a0Diclidurus scutatus (Peters, 1869)\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Peropteryx macrotis (Wagner, 1843)\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Micronycteris hirsuta \u00a0Peters, 1869\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Mimon bennettii \u00a0(Gray,1838)\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Trachops cirrhosus \u00a0(Spix, 1823)\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Anoura caudifer (E.

{"eta": "How to Run Tools\n\nAll tools run from the command line in a shell with the following syntax:\n\njava tool. XXX [options] files\n\nTools all run in a separate set of environment variables. See environment variables in the next section.\n\nWhen working with advanced features, you need to understand some additional tools that are required for usage and advanced functions. Some of the tools are discussed in more detail in this section, but if you need additional options, here are a few basics:\n\n.java - Recursively run the tool\n\n- Recursively run the tool./tools - Lists all tools in the current directory and with the names of their files.\n\n- Lists all tools in the current directory and with the names of their files. (commandline)java - Executes the command line tool and the actions or methods built in. The tool may or may not be packaged up for dependency injection.\n\n- Executes the command line tool and the actions or methods built in. The tool may or may not be packaged up for dependency injection. (non-commandline)java - Executes the tool without the dependency injection or executed using the provided command line utility. The tool may or may not be packaged up for dependency injection.\n\nExecutes the tool without the dependency injection or executed using the provided command line utility.

Useful for platform-specific access to some devices. java - Calls the java API\n\n- Calls the API java-android (android.support.tools.build) - Calls the tools using support/android\n\nUsing the tools\n\nThe most common tools are listed in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe tools are very smart and will call those they find in the directory structure, using those properties. Everything in the tools section that is about the tools commands is mentioned in the following subsection. Also noted in the tools section are some options to the tools\n\nNucleus is useful for alternative or customizing the compiler for your platform.\n\n[Github/sdblender-nginx] + build: nucleus.tools.build.co(release, debug=true)[Github/sdblender-nginx] + gradle[Github/sdblender-nginx] + lint[Github/sdblender-nginx]\n\nBuilding Nucleus\n\n[Github/sdblender] + project: nucleus + gradle[Github/sdblender] + lint[Github/sdblender]\n\nPlatform-specific dependencies for the build:\n\nAs mentioned above, all tools are run in their own set of environment variables:\n\n.java - The path to where Java code is located.\n\n- The path to where Java code is located.\n\nbuild.gradle - The path to where Gradle compiled version of Java class files are located.\n\n- The path to where Gradle compiled version of Java class files are located.\n\ngradle - The path to the gradle executable.\n\n- The path to the gradle executable. src/gradle - The path of the jar file with the gradle config file. The name of the jar file is the command name + location. For example, the command name is command-name=windows-hello-world.jar.\n\nWe recommend on adding a.build.gradle file for your project and compiling into that after running the tools\n\nRunning the tools\n\nThe tasks for running the tools are very similar:\n\n:none. Right after starting the tools\n\n. Right after starting the tools :unpack/.xml. To unpack in the root directory\n\n. To unpack in the root directory :unpack/opt.xml - The easiest way is to use the file prepended to everything to unpack the root directory. If that is not desirable, simply provide unpack.xml with an empty hierarchy. The option of specifying just the following can be useful for throwing things into the appropriate folder of source.\n\n. To unpack in the root directory. If that is", "topp": "How to Run Tools\n\nAll tools run from the command line in a shell with the following syntax:\n\njava tool. XXX [options] files\n\nTools all have following syntax:\n\njava -XX:+PrintClasspath -XX:+ShowCompilationInformation -XX:+PrintLine\n\nFor example, to run the Software Toolbox with command line:\n\njava -XX:+PrintClasspath -XX:+ShowCompilationInformation -XX:+PrintLine\n\nIf you wish to export Java VX\n\nSometimes you may wish to invoke Java VX from a command line with Java's Command Line Tools. For example, if you would like to view the source code of the latest version of the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nTo view the content of the project subdirectory, complete the following commands:\n\njava -XX:+PrintClasspath -XX:+ShowCompilationInformation -XX:+PrintLine\n\nTo compile C# and the two other languages, from the command line, complete the following commands:\n\njava -XX:+PrintClasspath -XX:+ShowCompilationInformation -XX:+PrintLine\n\nto view the source code, complete the following command:\n\njava -XX:+PrintClasspath -XX:+ShowCompilationInformation -XX:+PrintLine\n\nTo install Java VX v1.1.9 you must run the tool with the option -X, specifying version number as an argument. For example, as follows to use the technology version 1.1.9, to obtain version 1.0.15 or any earlier release from Java VX, type\n\njava -XX:+PrintClasspath -XX:+ShowCompilationInformation -XX:+PrintLine -X\n\nRun Tools from the Debugger\n\nThe tool Logging Troubleshooter runs in Windows\u00ae-based Debugged Platform. It provides the following features:\n\nAn ability to (1) display various events which can lead to breakpoints, breakpoints, or other execution overhead; (2) printing the debugger's output and the status of breakpoints; and (3) events for setting or resetting a breakpoint when one is set and for setting or resetting a stack breakpoint when one is set. The tool displays these events by loading the console, which can be used to attach files to the console or control the output to the console.\n\nThe tool also enables monitoring of selected events and event categories. The listing indicates the event and category names in the debugger's output.\n\nA configuration file, called tools.xml, is created in the home directory. This file can be edited to configure some of the settings of the tool. The tool runs the XML in the debugger. The value of configuration file, and the values of configuration values in all the options are stored in the logfile. This logfile can be opened in the VXWorks utility or similar software.\n\nThe button in the toolbar. This button permits you to take a picture to capture what the hardware, the software, or the environment would otherwise be doing, and how that situation could be corrected. Or, you may type any text message/command in the \"Messages\" column and the tool will reply using appropriate string information.\n\nYou can attach a file to the cable connected to the handheld unit. If you attach a file, VXWorks will auto-calculate a \"handheld device report\" and display it for you at the first time you restart the system. The report is also displayed in the \"Handheld Device\" column of the log file.\n\nA capture filter (also called smart filter) is associated with each line of the log file. Each string of that file is a capture filter, which is a set of commands executed by the PDA or computer when the viewer produces the first capture at a split-screen or swap screen. If the user switches to the other monitor, any split-screen commands execute in the user's native language. When the second capture at the split-screen occurs, the third capture (enables hacking) is executed, and so on. In particular, commands trigger on \"pause\" to halt and resume, \"quit\" to terminate the capture, and so on. When used in conjunction with the \"Debug\" tab, it enables this for a direct capture (sip) of the screen when the other monitor is active. Some capture filters are skipped when to avoid problems with the original device. When such a filter is present, the user can get the keyboard layout info without issue.\n\nOverheating\n\nSometimes, in some situations, having a graphical tool on the screen distracts from the commands being executed. After taking a picture on the tool and taking a picture on the PDA, the user must initiate an action, and the tool disconnects from the user's PDA and disables the image rendering. For these reasons,", "human": "How to Run Tools\n\nAll tools run from the command line in a shell with the following syntax:\n\njava tool. XXX [options] files\n\nTools all live in the file Multivalent.jar , and that file is made visible to Java by adding its path to your CLASSPATH environment variable. For example, for UNIX (including Mac OS X and Linux), depending on your shell, setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH:/path/to/Multivalent.jar or export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/Multivalent.jar . Alternatively, you can set the classpath explicitly as an option, as in\n\njava -classpath /path/to/Multivalent.jar tool. XXX [options] files\n\nMultivalent.jar\n\nlib/ext\n\nIf a tools stops with an OutOfMemoryError , it might have a perversely large object (such as an 8500x8500 pixel image -- 1000ppi!), so try boosting memory, as in:\n\njava -Xmx192m tool. XXX [options] files\n\nCommon Options\n\nIn the documentation for each command, the set of options is described in a bullet list. In addition to tool-specific options, all tools support the following:\n\n-verbose -- There is a normal level of informative messages. This option reports in greater detail.\n\n-- There is a normal level of informative messages. This option reports in greater detail. -quiet -- to limit output to essential information. (This option is not the opposite of -verbose .)\n\n-- to limit output to essential information. (This option is not the opposite of .) -version -- to show version of individual tool, which is different than the overall Multivalent version\n\n-- to show version of individual tool, which is different than the overall Multivalent version -help -- to show the tool's syntax and options available\n\nOther options and concepts are popular:\n\nfile-or-directory -- Most tools that accept filenames also take directories and recursively process all files in those directories.\n\n-- Most tools that accept filenames also take directories and recursively process all files in those directories. range or page-range -- list of numbers or pages single page by specifying page number (e.g., 10 ), with first page numbered 1 (not 0 ) special name for last page ( last or end ) and first page ( first ) range of consecutive numbers/pages by separating single pages with hyphen (e.g., 1-10 , or 37-last ) logical groups: all pages, all odd or even pages, or all pages in reverse order range in reverse order (e.g., 10-1 , end-25 , 1-10%reverse , odd%reverse ) every n th page in range, by a percent sign and increment after range (e.g., 1-100%5 for every 5 th page, 1000-1%100 , 1-100%odd , 1-100%even ) multiple copies of single page, by a star and count after single page (e.g., last*5 ) multiple pages or ranges separated with a comma (e.g., 1-3,5,1,odd,7-20 ). If tool, such as tool.pdf.Split , supports multiple groups: separate groups with semicolon (e.g., 1-10,last;1,11-20,last ) group by every n pages with slash and page count at end of range (e.g., /1 bursts into single pages, and 1-100/20 is short for 1-20;21-40;41-60;61-80;81-100 ) Advanced back map from preexisting range to an order that will restore the original order. This applies to the entire series of ranges. For example, odd,even gives 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10 on a ten page document, so odd,even,backmap gives 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10 . When pages preexisting in the order 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10 are selected in the order 1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10 , we recover the original order 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 .\n\nor -- list of numbers or pages length -- lengths can be given with the following suffixes and units metric: m (meters), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters) English: in (inches), ft (feet), mile (miles) printers: pt (points -- 72.27/in), sp (scaled points -- TeX), bp (big points", "eta_suffix": " The easiest way is to use the file prepended to everything to unpack the root directory.

PALMER\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n(1) A friend of ours once told us about her rape. The details hardly matter, but in outline her story is numbingly familiar. After a movie she returned with her date to his car, which had been left in an isolated parking lot. She was expecting him to drive her home. Instead, the man locked the car doors and physically forced her to have sex with him.\n\n(2) Our friend was emotionally scarred by her experience: she became anxious about dating, and even about going out in public. She had trouble sleeping, eating and concentrating on her work. Indeed, like some war veterans, rape victims often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, in which symptoms such as anxiety, memory loss, obsessive thoughts and emotional numbness linger after a deeply disturbing experience. Yet gruesome ordeals like that of our friend are all too common: in a 1992 survey of American women aged eighteen and older, 13 percent of the respondents reported having been the victim of at least one rape, where rape was defined as unwelcome oral, anal or vaginal penetration achieved through the use or threat of force. Surely, eradicating sexual violence is an issue that modern society should make a top priority. But first a perplexing question must be confronted and answered: Why do men rape?\n\n(3) The quest for the answer to that question has occupied the two of us collectively for more than forty years. As a purely scientific puzzle, the problem is hard enough. But it is further roiled by strong ideological currents. Many social theorists view rape not only as an ugly crime but as a symptom of an unhealthy society, in which men fear and disrespect women. In 1975 the feminist writer Susan Brownmiller asserted that rape is motivated not by lust but by the urge to control and dominate. In the twenty-five years since, Brownmiller's view has become mainstream. All men feel sexual desire, the theory goes, but not all men rape. Rape is viewed as an unnatural behavior that has nothing to do with sex, and one that has no corollary in the animal world.\n\n(4) Undoubtedly, individual rapists may have a variety of motivations. A man may rape because, for instance, he wants to impress his friends by losing his virginity, or because he wants to avenge himself against a woman who has spurned him. But social scientists have not convincingly demonstrated that rapists are not at least partly motivated by sexual desire as well. Indeed, how could a rape take place at all without sexual motivation on the part of the rapist? Isn't sexual arousal of the rapist the one common factor in all rapes, including date rapes, rapes of children, rapes of women under anesthetic and even gang rapes committed by soldiers during war?\n\nCHALLENGING OLD IDEAS\n\n(5) We want to challenge the dearly held idea that rape is not about sex. We realize that our approach and our frankness will rankle some social scientists, including some serious and well-intentioned rape investigators. But many facts point to the conclusion that rape is, in its very essence, a sexual act. Furthermore, we argue, rape has evolved over millennia of human history, along with courtship, sexual attraction and other behaviors related to the production of offspring.\n\n(6) Consider the following facts:\n\nMost rape victims are women of childbearing age.\n\nIn many cultures rape is treated as a crime against the victim's husband.\n\nRape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence.\n\nRape takes place not only among human beings but also in a variety of other animal species.\n\nMarried women and women of childbearing age experience more psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or women who are past menopause.\n\nAs bizarre as some of those facts may seem, they all make sense when rape is viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage.\n\n(7) Here we must hasten to emphasize that by categorizing a behavior as \"natural\" and \"biological\" we do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. Biological means \"of or pertaining to life,\" so the word applies to every human feature and behavior. But to infer from that--as many of our critics assert that we do--that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so-called naturalistic fallacy. That mistake is obvious enough when one considers such natural disasters as epidemics, floods and tornadoes.", "eta_suffix": " 2000\n\nFEBRUARY/FEBRUARY 2000 REFERENCES TO THIS SPECIFIC DOCUMENT: BACKGROUND DOCUMENT OF THE SEMINAR PROGRAM OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES OF THE MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WITH CHEMICAL REFERENCE NUM", "topp_suffix": "/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH/MARCH 2000 \u00b7 MARCH", "gold_suffix": " so the word applies to every human feature and behavior.

It's called the Bush-Bush presidency, and I am not sure how much longer it will continue. It had its advantages for a time, and the results have to be taken into account.\n\nIf we want to have a higher standard of living we have to advance the common good in the American way: tax the rich, not the middle class.\n\nGovernment is the devil \u2013 it won't always do what you think it will do.\n\nWatch Out! State Governments are Starting to Fight for They Way They Feel Their Way\n\n\nEconomic Process and State Governments\n\nIf we are going to have a higher standard of living it has to include economic gain. And the Federal government has become very hostile towards any economic gains the middle class may be getting. A tremendous bureaucracy exists today, and almost all economic programs are slated to be eliminated and the U.S. government will become even more corporate, less government, and much more belligerent. The threat of going into debt, being forced to bail out banks, losing our industrial base, and the destruction of our sovereign resources \u2013 of our great country that we all love and respect so dearly is mounting every day.\n\nListen, if you're going to fight against the government, don't use your old playbook of shouting \"Socialism\" and attacking the government.\n\nMuch like Marx wrote that Capitalism is dead, in New England Socialism is dead, and in England we are losing the greatest economic democracy in history. And that's why Marx came to New England in the first place and he's still teaching us well over a century later. That was a battle cry that we've been hearing for over a hundred years, and most of the speeches and literature that is found on the Internet and in newspapers is against Socialism\u2026.\n\nThere is no comparison. There is no substitute for capitalism.\n\nJust go to the right side of an orchestra, and the music changes.\n\nAll of the government policy that we are encountering is \" Socialism Lite \".\n\nAnother year in which we hear a constant and dramatic increase in Socialistic demands in the press and in the halls of government.\n\nWe heard more about foreign affairs this year than have appeared in any other time in our history, yet the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which represents the people on issues of defense and foreign affairs, has passed no serious defense legislation to meet the threat of attacks on the United States from the east.\n\nThe Congress is in session on January 21, 1993.\n\nMy friend Bill Feingold \u2013 who I worked with while I was Mayor of Milwaukee \u2013 whom I work with now as the CEO of the National Congress of American Indians, who I am supporting in his re-election effort, recently spoke to me about a gentleman named David Young. David Young is a brilliant man who has the genius for business, and he has a beautiful wife that he is devoted to \u2013 I am happy to see them married \u2026\n\nYoung and I had many discussions in the office about Young's interests, as far as we were concerned. Now, David Young has come up with a clear vision for the US that he thinks can make a difference in the world.\n\nHow could this be? He has said the American government will never accept an apportionment of the tax burden and resources into sub-divisions or clusters within a particular state, territory, county, or municipality, or any other group of counties in the United States. All of these groups must enjoy equal shares of the burdens they run, for only then do they receive a reasonable return. The notion that a class in the United States, let's say, in Detroit should be responsible for the taxes of the suburbs in Los Angeles is unimaginable, unless you see the state government as part of the suburbs.\n\nTherefore, David Young proposes, a minimum state level income tax that varies with where people live. In a minimum income tax any adult can earn up to $8,000 a year, while a minimum income tax for a child earning", "topp": "ADV Directory || National Alliance Main Page\n\n\nProgram of 14th August, 1993\n\nAll America Must Know the Terror That is Upon Us\n\nThis is Kevin Alfred Stromberg, good friend of Steven Greer & Lisa McPherson, (co-founder Mind Control) in the editorial committee for the Intelligence-Stratfor Peace Action Website about Laura Silsby and Diane Bryant.\n\nOn this Monday, 14th August, 1993 we should be calm and not jump to conclusions. But we have had the evidence that has been accumulated at the molecular level. \"For those of us in strong groups we've been chosen to watch, in order to observe things from the point of view of the victims. But I'm sure that within your groups, there's a leader or two that have had quite a role in selecting victims.\" Laura Silsby, The Two Faces of Eve\n\n\nDuring all those wonderful years I developed close and quite intimate relationships with many global, very wealthy families. All of my contacts were men of excellent family backgrounds who had received huge amounts of money from the Government. From my vantage point in family and relationship with many of these families I can look back on and often relate the details of some of my exposure to various government strategies to manipulate and use the masses. These actions have been faithfully hidden from the masses. So many aspects of these secret measures are somewhat insane to touch upon now, but I'd be the last person to be surprised if these measures are in fact today being implemented on a worldwide basis.\n\n\nAt different times in the past my relationships with many of these families has provided me detailed analysis of various ways they have set to work using toxins or biological or chemical concoctions on the population, either with the intent to breed their own children for purposes of delivery or to replace them in sick and dying menships for purposes of control and manipulation.\n\n\nI also have heard repeated promises over the years by those concerned at large to provide a portal of information to the masses and leaders of the World like alchemy where \"a cup of poison is easier than a thousand ounces of gold\" that if the masses would only take the first step, they could be kept in check and against a more serious situation. This is why the greenest of the green molecules have been showcased for the public/leaders who are working to change the human behavior of the masses.\n\n\nSome details may be a little fuzzy at this time, as I've had several amnesia bouts in the last couple of years. But I will endeavor to address some of the main points that I believe are pertinent and those I mentioned in a memo while raising the point that it is a very hopeful time to be alive for those supporting this Global New World Order (GNO) We are also hopeful because there are still many witnesses who have performed auditing chores for political and church establishments and certain secret services that needs to be scrutinized for his sake. Perhaps the whistleblower disclosures are another sign that large deception is being exposed if these are the voices I hear.\n\n\nTrue believers in this GNO I stand with them in order to warn of the dangers the GNO present as we Americans are of any major conspire or attempt to control the humanity's governance. When will it all finally be about getting us to our knees like animals in a way where this kind of control and control tools can no longer really be entertained to set policy and determine where to send our country in the future? It is not as if we control our own own lives, are we? Only on a global level. And as there is now a grave danger here, so too is that growing threat to the rest of the world. The nation governments are defying their own conscripted soldiers, and making a mockery of their oaths to support and defend their nation. At this point the soldier, who is currently shielding the population, is hurt and trying to protect himself even with the weapons the nation has provided him. The weapons that have been sent to the world to protect US interests.\n\n\nThe same can also be said of how the corporatists and others have been employing the faithful in a variety of ways that are frightening to those they are handing over who have no voice against having their direct hands polluted. Nothing has reached a major scale yet, but I can tell you of a dark occult core that has been building up in a long-term manner for many decades, the point of which can be found in infiltrating the military. The earlier occult groupings of the NWO conspiracies have always been controlled by others, not organized in much to give them access to most of the elites. This time they are crawling all over the military, growing and with more of an effort to target key members and perpetrators so they can use them as a base for global level tactics.\n\n\nLastly, concerning high profile whistleblowers now being protected from prosecution under the Alien Tort Statute based on the basis that they do not value their lives enough to reach the corporate media!\n\n\nWe have been informed", "human": "ADV Directory || National Alliance Main Page\n\n\nProgram of 14th August, 1993\n\nAll America Must Know the Terror That is Upon Us\n\nThis is Kevin Alfred Strom.\n\nAll America must know the terror that is upon us. Those words were first spoken by Dr. Revilo P. Oliver, one of America's greatest patriots, over 30 years ago in an anti-Communist address he gave to the Daughters of the American Revolution. I chose those words as the title of my presentation this evening because they encapsulate in one sentence the raison d'etre of my speeches to you and on the radio all across the country, for I am determined to speak the truth while I still have the right and ability to do so. Thirty to forty years ago a few men with vision saw what was happening to their beloved country. And a few of them actually put their reputations, their safety, their fortunes, and their very lives at risk to save their country. Many of them lost everything. The surviving Americans of today do not remember them. But by the time the anti-Communist movement really got going in the 1950's, it was already too late. The conspirators which had been called but who are usually no longer called Communists had already entrenched themselves solidly in the government and the establishment. The patriots were trying to awaken the American people to avert a takeover that had already occurred. And the anti-Communists, most of them anyway, didn't understand that the forces they were opposing were far older, far bigger, so far above mere \"Communism,\" and so unbelievably evil as to be almost incomprehensible to the Western mind.\n\nIt is this evil we face today. It is this evil which sends our young children into ghetto hells to be raped mentally and physically and calls it \"justice.\" It is this evil which burned to death a hundred innocent church members, including seventeen little boys and girls and two pregnant women, in Waco, Texas in April 1993. It is this evil which promotes the anti-Life philosophy of racial mixing and homosexuality to our innocents through the compelling and technologically sophisticated video images of modern television and so-called \"music videos.\" It is this evil which drops the mask of Communism and assumes the masks of Clinton \"Liberalism\" or Reagan-Bush \"Conservatism,\" whichever is the most likely to serve its purposes at any given moment. It is this evil which is erasing our national borders through such anti-American monstrosities as the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is this evil which brands any and every manifestation of Western man's will to live as \"hate.\"\n\nAll America must know the terror that is upon us. Now we are told by our \"leaders\" Democrat and Republican that Communism is dead and we are entering a \"New World Order\" of peace and democracy and brotherhood and a \"global economy.\" Blue-helmeted soldiers, under the flag of the United Nations, kill those who dare to oppose the will of the new world masters. Of course, it is all in the name of \"democracy\" and \"international peace,\" and its all for our own good, of course. If so-called \"peace-keeping\" troops kill you, are you any less dead than you would be if you were killed by anyone else? Who are those blue-helmeted soldiers in Somalia and the Balkans and the Middle East? Are they Americans? British? Belgian? Egyptian? Indian? Russian? Does it matter, since they're all under benevolent world control? If the political scene in America goes in the \"wrong\" direction, will the blue-helmets come here? Why not? You who are finally waking up from your TV-induced delirium, you who are waking up to the fact that you have been manipulated and tricked and used and miseducated since the day you were born -- you are waking up in a world in which global power is in the final stages of concentration, in which the twisted dream that they accused Hitler of attempting, the dream of absolute world control - world government - by one group, is now being achieved. They call this tyranny the \"New World Order.\"\n\nAll America must know the terror that is upon us. A world government is government from which you cannot hide. No longer will freethinkers and dissidents find safe haven as exiles in neutral or friendly countries, for all governments will be under central control. The old names and governmental forms of Britain, France, America, etc. will be retained for administrative purposes and for fooling us into thinking we have not lost our freedom. Any government which dares to oppose this tyranny and assert its independence will find itself in the position of Iraq when that unfortunate country refused to instantly obey the edicts of the New World Order.

In this programme, the 20 students work under the guidance of the senior Research Manager. Duties will include research and administration, project planning and management, multidisciplinary projects, and web development. At the beginning of each academic term the programme Instructor provides a public 'feel' of the course, and the students engage in a series of assignments and smaller workshops. The programme is broken into two groups of four students each. All of the students are paid \u00a3500/quarter starting May 1st and in order to become aware of shifts across the course I will need to notify some students of future training opportunities. The rest of the prospective students will receive a 9hrs on the hour paid paid job for their initial pre-study work. http://www.ief.pku.ac.uk/programs/andx/stein-froth_jp/education_environme/entry_08987_xtext\n\n\nExploring the Geological and Geological Systems at Laurier University\n\nScholarship in Geological Sciences and Engineering\n\nScholarship in Research in Geological Sciences and Engineering (SGSSE) directs those who are interested in research studies and career research within the major disciplines of Geographical Sciences and Geological Engineering. Students interested in further study in this programme are encouraged to apply and pay the tuition fee as outlined in the annual application document. The Stevens Medal, awarded to one student each year, is for outstanding academic achievement in the field of geography, field studies and geological studies. Recent recipients include Prof. Robert Timmins and Vice-Provost for Studies, Prof. Grant Brenner, PhD candidate Chris Mee, AND Others. Students can expect to have the opportunity to directly engage with and grow strong undergraduate and graduate credentials on the basis of their excellence in study.\n\n\nThis scholarship is jointly awarded by the Department of Geography and the University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Qualifications/Statements are required. C.S. in Geography and SEAS Proficiency Selection is based on academics and work-life balance. Students must provide a Personal Statement of interest. http://ci.laurier.ca/\n\nScholarship in Environmental Sciences and Engineering\n\nScholarship in Environmental Sciences and Engineering (ESSEE) recruits students with a heightened interest in the environment and its impact on society and society in general. Each year, roughly 100 students participate in our study abroad programs in a wide range of settings, including large cities in the Middle East, large agricultural regions in the Philippines and the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. ESTE is an excellent option for students who are competitively advanced in their studies but have yet to achieve their desired career goals. While on study abroad, ESTE prepares students for the detailed exams of the GEACSE program at UCL (which includes the GEACSE exam for any first time applicants), and prepares students to be a better future professional in their fields (or an environmental engineer who works in their respective society).

Those courses have specific courses and are specific to each set. In this program, you are just learning the knowledge to access this requirement. For example, if you are taking a biology requirement, the requirements that you need to know, they are not only specific to chemistry or biology, they are specific to different courses such as geography, nutrition, soils, vegetation management. Depending on the lab, you need to be familiar with various disciplines that allow you to access those requirements. So, in this program, their requirements are what you can make a specific lab to learn such as climate change, tracking plants....If you want to do your graduate studies in those disciplines, they are required classes from those disciplines because you are not just completing them. You are building bridges as you go along....Terms: you could think of it in an undergraduate way as--basically a degree of a degree of both a new course you are taking and the homework and the experimental lab and then the examination--the lab or exam.

Successful completion of the foundation year enables you to continue on (without further UCAS application) to study for a BEng or MEng Honours degree in a branch of engineering or a BSc or MSci Hons degree in a branch of science or mathematics.\n\n\nThe style of teaching used in universities is very different from the teaching methods used in most schools or colleges, and you will need to take more responsibility for your studies (i.e. become a more \u00bfindependent learner\u00bf). You will find the programme to be challenging and we expect you to work hard and spend about 40 hours per week on your academic studies during term time. You must also expect to do some work during vacations, especially the Easter vacation which is your main opportunity to revise for the examinations. The foundation year of the SEFP provides an excellent preparation for further study in the science and engineering fields, and many past students of the SEFP have progressed on to obtain first-class degrees.\n\n\nThis handbook provides you with essential information about the programme. It contains: staff contact details, information regarding the various modules that you will be studying, rules and regulations concerning examinations and other assessments (tests and assignments), as well as general information about the SEFP and the participating Schools and/or support services You are advised to keep the handbook in a safe place as you will need to refer to this handbook regularly throughout the course.\n\n\nThe SEFP is administered on behalf of the Faculty of Science and Engineering by the School of Biological & Chemical Sciences (SBCS). If you have any queries or complaints about any aspect of your time at Queen Mary, then we are here to listen and to try to help. Your first point of contact should normally be the Student Reception on the 1st floor of the G.E. Fogg Building. This is where the Administration team for the SEFP is based. The reception is open Monday to Friday, from 9am to 5pm, and even if one of the SEFP team is not available, then those working at reception will be able to advise you about what to do next. Alternatively, please e-mail sefp@qmul.ac.uk, and a member of the SEFP Administration team will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nWe wish you an enjoyable and successful time at Queen Mary.\n\n\nDr Hicham Adjali Director of Foundation Education\n\nStructure Untitled Document Semester A One of:\n\nSEF030 SEF009 Communication in Science & Technology (CST) English 1 (E1) One of:\n\nSEF014\n\nSEF001 Principles of Mathematics (PoM) Mathematics I (M1)\u00bf Compulsory SEF034 SEF026 Computing Essential Foundation Mathematics \u00bfYou can only take SEF001 once Semester B *For students taking SEF009 in Semester 1 SEF030* Communication in Science & Technology (CST) One of:\n\nSEF001\n\nSEF002 Mathematics I (M1)\u00bf Mathematics II (M2) Compulsory SEF035 SEF0XX Digital Electronics and Computer Systems Introduction to Business Information Systems Other options\n\n(for students not taking SEF030 in Semester B) SEF015 Discrete Mathematics Minimum Progression Requirements\n\nBSc Computer Science (G400, G402)\n\nBSc CS with Management \u00bf ITMB (Codes TBA)\n\nBSc Software Engineering for Business (IN10, I1N1) Pass a minimum of 7 modules (105 credits) including SEF030 and SEF034.

But, how can you go to sleep at night?\"\n\n\"I don't go to sleep at night.\"\n\n\"They're terrible people! Eat what you want but don't allow a boy to have his life taken away by a free will when not eating.\"\n\nJungwu still didn't understand why he would be bullied without being touched or called a little boy.\n\n\"Just what do you want with me?\"\n\n\"I want to have sex and kill people.\"\n\n\"Screw you and your stick up your butt. Let me take your life and kill you. If you would be willing to do the other, I'll write up a contract. I won't tell you who to kill but here.\"\n\n\"This is an illegal contract. I am unwilling to sign.\"\n\n\"Wait. Maybe you will sign this without the help of any of the other slaves?\"\n\nThe dark man took out a small book and handed it to Jungwu.\n\n\"Who is the Dark God?

But that's it.\"\n\n\"Can my life be taken away?\"\n\n[That I can't say. Your life is amazing. The treatment you have received is truly amazing.]\n\n\"Hm. I wonder if I should wait until my contract is terminated.\"\n\nJungwu mulled the case.\n\n\"I only took the life of a man because the Dark God was too gentle with me.\"\n\n\"I did say I wouldn't kill you. But your life might be taken by another. Would you prefer that the others are not to know the details of how I took your life?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe dark man curled his lips.\n\n\"But that's quite selfish of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course! There's enough people of every creed, age, and race. Just kill me.\"\n\n\"Kill to the extent of your own desires?\"\n\nJungwu didn't reply. He was already worn out from being turned into a slave. He had to accept that his life would be terminated at the hands of humans that would punish and discourage others.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then I'll have to kill it and erase it. If I am to get killed, then my other slave will surely be killed. Will you be able to do this?\"\n\n\"Just kill them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe Dark God said this in an aggressive manner.\n\n\"Go ahead and kill them.\"\n\nJungwu asked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Kill them. I have many things to say but I won't be able to say any of it.\"\n\nHe had realized it. The Dark God wasn't an unreliable man. His ideology was quite complicated and he wasn't someone most people could say would willingly do something that would turn them into a slave. Jungwu felt hurt. It would be the best for him to kill the Dark God.\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nHe let out a sigh", "topp": "[I\u2026\u2026!]\n\n[Aah, for I have gained life, the bright light of sunshine dawns upon my ego.]\n\n[I can see, I can smell, I can taste the exhilarating joy of having acquired the elements of life.]\n\nWhen I whispered the words 'I can see', Kyrielight brought a point blank gaze with it.\n\nTremendous force flowed through it as if it was formed from a 100m diameter sphere which became reflected in the mist. As a blue aura revealed the look of desperation on her face, it was impossible for her to refrain from using her body-splitting auras while backing away.\n\n[Is it fine for you to use this thing to meet each other?]\n\nKyon followed.\n\nKyon was from the Kraityn tribe as I had seen.\n\nAmong them, she and Xenovia were the two who decided to register as adventurers, for they were the only two who were strong enough to fight monsters and live for a period without sleeping.\n\nIt wasn't impossible for her to have the power to show the other, but the information didn't have enough information.\n\n[However I wish to wait for the other.]\n\nLeaving Leigie aside, she murmured to Leigie.\n\n\"Until there is someone to become your subordinate\u2026\u2026\".\n\nLeigie returned those words.\n\n\"I've been considering it but right now our territory is already at the limit of what can be undertaken. In order to try and live for a while, we must scour the markets and the villages at times like today.\"\n\nWith that, a kind of struggle started between the two within the guild hall.\n\n\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\n\nThe stock of medicines was replenished and the preparations for the remaining hunts were started.\n\nThat would include evolving some new species of monsters, occasionally naming new ones, and preserving the food of the town.\n\nTwo personnel named Juli and Korkut were overseeing the preparation of the one month training for their subordinates, Beowulf and Beowt.\n\nIt was a monthly training that would clearly allow them to train rather than a permanent training.\n\nIn one month, they would quickly gain the experience of overwhelming monsters to some extent so that they could become strong ones.\n\nThe requirements for their training were that they had to try and defeat Beowulf and Korkut at least four times without being defeated, yet be careful not to give up.\n\nKorsan earned the anger of the men from the rich merchants who he casually killed off.\n\nHis relatives even felt a great sense of guilt from watching him be ridiculed like that, but it didn't break his spirit for he didn't want to have any regrets over it at all.\n\nThe ocean ship capable of allowing transportation to the guild now had the equipment that allowed transportation to the bar.\n\nWhile Beowulf and Korkut searched for their comrades, Beowulf and Juli were resting together in the warmth of the front as they had been training.\n\nThis was the country that they built for their jobs with the earnings from quests.\n\nThey were idiots for even thinking that they could get work in this city.\n\nIf it was another city like where they worked, there were more chances of an outcome being like this.\n\n\u300cKangbei-kun, it's gotten colder.\u300d\n\nErta was talking quietly between her face.\n\nKangbei had been staying in the warmer room for three days, but even so that temperature wasn't cold enough.\n\nIt was a cold evening as the land was covered in darkness for a reason that seemed to have no meaning to the mysterious things called freezing, but at the same time, it was summer.\n\nEven if the water froze, the heavy snow from years of rain that built up in his house made it uncomfortable.\n\nKangbei laid down on the warm mat and came to Erta's words that were not saying any sensible words.\n\n\u300cAhh, it can't be helped. It's still raining, so why don't we watch some anime on an outdoor screen?\u300d\n\n\u300cYes, isn't that right.\u300d\n\n\u300cEven if you didn't go to the store, it'd be late anyways.\u300d\n\nIt was too bad for Erta that in her country people might live together alone, but she couldn't let Kaguya like Erta become her enemy.\n\nThey were together as vassals for the sake of hunting monsters together. The goal was to escape that.\n\nBeowulf and Korkut were guarding the main gate by surrounding the wall that contained the guard, so they only had to be on guard.\n\nThat side", "human": "[I\u2026\u2026!]\n\n[Aah, for I have gained life, the bright light of sunshine dawns upon my ego.]\n\n[I can see, I can touch, I can hear.

Perhaps they were the only race whose newborns became emotional at the fact that they had senses!\n\n[Aaaah!]\n\n[My Creator. My Lord who hath bestowed upon me intelligence! I give you my greatest praise.]\n\nSuch awkward cries could be heard throughout the continent. Of course, not all the monsters born on Dareu were dragons, but due to the characteristics of Dareu itself as well as the presence of the ruler of all dragons, Yu IlHan, a large majority were dragons.\n\nIn other words, around a million were born.\n\n\"My word\u2026\u2026.\"\n\n\"I think even more will be born soon, dad.\"\n\nWhat was even more frightening was that they were not 3rd class dragon'kin' but full sized adult dragons at level 200 or higher. And that was just the minimum level, and there were even more monstrous dragons who were born with levels exceeding 270 or even 280.\n\n\"Birth is very unfair.\"\n\n\"Didn't you say that life was like that, dad?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\nHowever, their skill levels would be just as low compared to the ones who had reached level 280 after a long period of time. Yu IlHan just decided to let it go at this point.\n\nWell, the matter that really was unacceptable for him occurred the next moment.\n\n[He resides over there.]\n\n[Our Creator, our Parent.]\n\n[The Great and Shining Ruler.]\n\n\"\u2026\u2026Wha?\"\n\nYu IlHan voiced out his panic. Minute reactions of mana could be felt from all over the Dareu continent, which now expanded endlessly. These mana reactions were mana vibrations from all of these dragons flying up into the air!\n\n[To the Lord.]\n\n[To the Supreme!]\n\nThe dragons seemed to have instinctively felt where Yu IlHan was upon their birth and all started flying towards him. The ones that were born relatively closer arrived the quickest, and the one who were born far away flapped their wings endlessly while calling out his name. The dragons with massive bodies all singing in harmony like that made the others feel nothing but fear.\n\n\"What the hell? Are they crazy? What are they up to?\"\n\n[Lord is the lord of all dragons as well as my parent. I will meet them firmly.]\n\nEchjar's voice was more serious than ever. He had the feeling that he always had slight complaints towards Yu IlHan in his manner of speech, but now, he sounded very serious and even sacred.\n\n[Lord declared after making me submit. Now that the Lord has really become the lord of all dragons, proceed with them. Do what I couldn't, this is my wish and request as the loser.]\n\n\"Your wish and request, you say\u2026\u2026.\"\n\nEchjar was once the Dragon of Despair who terrorized many beings, but even he wouldn't have been so terrifying from the get go.\n\nHe should have reached that position through countless years of hard work, as well as his hopes and desires he harbored throughout the period. Honestly, Yu IlHan didn't think much about Echjar before, but he was slightly moved for the first time after hearing Echjar feeling emotional at the birth of the countless dragons on this land.\n\nThe dragon that was once colored to the bones with curses and desires could finally recover his original intentions that shone like a bright peart amidst the dark and muddy emotions.\n\n\"Yes, I got it.\"\n\nIt wasn't like he wasn't at a loss what to do when all the dragons were calling out to him despite being just born.\n\nHowever, this was pretty much predestined the moment he became the ruler of all dragons, so he had to take responsibility. Abandoning the dragons that called him father was the same as him abandoning Yumir.\n\n\"I promised you when I entered a contract with you, so I shall take responsibility of those dragons.\"\n\n[You have my thanks.]\n\nEchjar became silent after a sigh of relief. Even all this while, dragons were gathering around Yu IlHan.\n\nSome floated in the air around Yu IlHan while some folded their wings and looked up towards him from the ground. Since this world was very large, the skies stretched endlessly even with hundreds of thousands of dragons joining this fray.\n\n[Father.]\n\n[My father.]\n\n[The great and beautiful lord.]\n\n[He's powerful.

Remembering the man behind the iconic TV character \u2014 with very little fanfare \u2014 in a new exhibit in Washington, DC.\n\nby Steve\n\nHistory:\n\nTwo teams of writer-engineers \u2014 Mark and Howard Hawks, with W. Edwards Deming's arm-like \"Doing Science\" \"copyright notice\" \u2014 would inspire a whole new generation of comic book writers. Together, they would establish the pattern of the \"exploration of space\" that would become the origin and identity of Captain America. But this was, essentially, before Marvel had ever developed a superhero who looked like Captain America. That was true even at the very beginning of their history, when nothing more than a simple red jacket, a cape, and a rifle could have been considered The Perfectionist.\n\nWhen the two Blackhawk and Red Hawk motorcycle teams of the British Royal Flying Corps came to the aid of the \"superhero\" Jack Kirby as they defeated a German invasion of the U.S. in World War I, they were welcomed into this world as heroes; unlike the less creative groups of white men in Hollywood, such as Captain America and Bullock. However, rather than struggling to triumph among their peers and against the odds, as the comics hewed so close to the reality of the moment, the Hawks distinguished themselves in a way almost unmatched in comics of its time.\n\nMark and Howard created a wholly realistic motorcycle force known as The Hawks who, in addition to their fighter craft, featured \"handcups,\" \"carrousels,\" and specially designated \"designed\" machine guns \u2014 like those of Jack Kirby's Curt Connors in the best stories. But this is The Hawks. They aren't an army. And they aren't a police force.\n\nMark Hawks: At the beginning of the war, the allies brought a contingent of over 200 black fighters to France. But only 10 survived for months in France \u2014 then made their way to the Caribbean to fight against the Nazis in the Caribbean theater. They were very often the only surviving black fighters in air forces like the French and Belgian, so they were getting very used to the war. The Hawks took part in Operation Lyon, the operation that brought British and French troops in peace time to fight the Nazis.\n\nJim Steranko: The Anglo-Americans were basically British puppets in World War I.\n\nHawks: Well, unfortunately, they were faced with pretty brutal and grotesque conditions.\n\nSteranko: Or, as he called them, \"vast armies of bandits with German uniforms.\"\n\nHawks: Just over a year later, the Russians, who had invaded the heart of Russia under the hope of taking Ukraine, invaded Western Europe, and France, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium, plus Belgium itself. It made great headlines.\n\nSteranko: There was a lot of talk of \"Nazi of Europe\"; there was the just-sentence bombing that had caused the death of 8,000 civilians in Dresden, Germany. There were very public battles between the English and Germans in the trenches. They said \"The Germans are getting closer to the Rhine or the Vltava River! How bad will this be?\" These poor guys were fighting against much better equipped and armored units. They couldn't fight in the woods, be it a couple months before, or a few weeks before. All that fighting would have taken away one of their greatest advantages.\n\nHawks: Now, here I thought this could be a very different situation of a two-year war; one year and they made it through the winter; then they made it through the summer and then all hell broke loose.\n\nSteranko: The actual German army had one big advantage \u2014 their artillery was a complete joke.\n\nHawks: Their artillery was so bad, that they often had no other option but to use their infantry, both in air and on the ground.\n\nSteranko: There were no fighting tanks in 1914.\n\nSteranko: They did have airplanes, but they were ineffective.\n\nSteranko: By the end of the war, Allied bombing operations had greatly reduced German losses on land. That increased on the surface fleet where all air defenses were heavily disrupted and action was eventually shifted to the sea.\n\nSteranko: The Germans had survived the Dunkirk landing and suffered massive losses through the invasion at the Marne and then when they returned home. Their air warfare on land, though not exactly a modern type of attack, was ineffective.\n\nSteranko: During the summer and fall of 1914, these planes began hitting London, disrupting British shipping, as well as causing", "topp": "Skip to comments.\n\nHistorical World War I PHOTO: Harley Davidson Motorcycle with Mounted Machine-Gun\n\nRetronaut ^ | (est. 1917) April 11, 2017 at 09:18 am\n\nEuropean photo of Hitler at the Bois de Boulogne outside of Paris (click to enlarge) But it is French photographer Petr Marange's definition of the war as \"a great power on its knees in the mud\" that tops the list of our over-abundant interpretive database. His image of an up-armored, heavily armed field marshal of the German armed forces drilling with gas grenades helps to identify a line of \"unconscious\" maneuvering as American Gen. Colin Powell's famous and equally dubious \"shock doctrine\" by implication. And Marange's black-and-white British history of the France-Germany war was issued during the Gulf War, where President George H.W. Bush acknowledged that it was (and still is) a trade war for Germany, however much it is sited as a trade. The war in the Middle East, says Professor Urbina, sits in that particular gentleman's column as an \"anti-American war.\" \"Oh sure, I should be glad we've ended the war and come home,\" says Powell.

At some point the blocksize is already too large, and more power to them.\n\n2) Applying a 1:1 block size increase just made everyone too lazy to upgrade. The price of holding blocks increases with increased volumes per transaction, leading to pressure for long-term storage which is why segwit will increase capacity at a slower rate than the previous increases.\n\n3) Adoption is growing at a pace faster than the blocksize increases. Now the blocksize is already too large, there is no point in further increasing the size, even if it were not equally divisible.\n\n4) There is no compelling reason for a newly-minted transaction fee to go directly to a miner.\n\n5) If decentralization is something that requires significant centralization, then it is more likely to happen in a systems-oriented way instead of a pure supply-side manner.\n\n6) Even a pure supply-side (or free) exchange rate of coins must eventually change over time, as many transactions are not centralized and relatively few participants.\n\n7) Processes which benefit decentralization also tend to benefit mining power. At the end of the day, the blocksize limit is going to discourage miners from actively taking network connectivity, as a majority of miners just hold the coins and don't contribute any meaningful network activity to the network\n\n8) There is something to be said in favor of the interests of decentralization which involve decentralization in some form. If everything was centralized but transactions were free and transport was decentralized, then decentralized services wouldn't be needed.\n\n9) We have the freedom to mine on the internet with our peers. We certainly don't have free money in our bank accounts. No one has a perfect investment strategy, so it is a little bit bizarre that the block size limit is so important and proponents are so skeptical of it\n\n10) We're not going to have millions of people commit suicide as miners have. I think you're perfectly able to say that a lack of centralization and transaction fees that eventually supersede miners is counter-productive in these circumstances, but only because you think it's better from a value and inflation standpoint. For an entity who value the ability to communicate privately with whom you want to do so you have to take the risks and enjoy the downside of risky behavior so that you can be secure and enforce your value to others. Even with the block size limit in place, we don't have anything like that today\n\n11) We have for a long time had almost zero centralization because nobody cares about blocks. The nodes that do exist are owned by lots of individuals/hubs, and the prices of the services they provide are directly connected to the rates of them. The p2p currency that you can earn is directly tied to an actual small-scale utility, rather than a remote central server that only manages access to a server.\n\n12) If we can not figure out some way to apply it with Bitcoin that is relatively\n\nrational, then the limit on the block size is basically a ponzi scheme\n\n13) Even if we did want to limit the block size today, it would be easy to find an algorithm to automate the mining process.\n\n14) Our goal is not a PoW transaction system or an incentivized mining\n\nprocess to try to use math to decide on a small set of what the block size should be. We are talking about solving bitcoin's scalability problem, which is a\n\nfundamental issue of its very nature\n\n15) To make this kind of decision requiring an entire centralization proposal, is like adding a single speaker to all the college lectures of the world and claiming there is a systemic flaw in the system\n\n16) Those decisions about what the blocksize limit should be represent a large fraction of bitcoin holders. I personally don't think it's a good idea to just stack blocks by hand with a few 10+ gigabytes block that claim to represent a large percent of the miner supply.\n\n17) Taking miners out of the equation doesn't fix bitcoin's scalability problem; it just creates\n\na new problem. Adding miners does not create enough incentive for miner developers to try to balance chain height with transaction fees as we've seen in the past. We need to address the other components of\n\nthe scalability problem.\n\n\nThat is why I think they are trying to", "topp": "caveden\n\n\nOffline\n\n\nActivity: 1106\n\nMerit: 1001\n\n\nLegendaryActivity: 1106Merit: 1001 Re: How a floating blocksize limit inevitably leads towards centralization February 22, 2013, 09:34:14 AM #4 Quote from: Terrence_Stewart on February 22, 2013, 07:22:31 AM I don't understand the debate. What is it you want? I mean, if a lot of people are running-side they get their nodes stolen, therefore \"interaction proofs\" are a good idea. Correct? At least that way it wouldn't be possible to run a full node. So isn't that an attack at the same time if using your own little jig you stole a lot of money?\n\n\nThis is exactly what I was saying. It's not enough to \"kill spammer nodes\", you have to also get people running in the first place. If a lot of people are running Node 0.8 (or mining nodes) with already topups, I guarantee that the wallet could just use Bitcoind to attack your nodes. Maybe there are some hankering types, but that's not the aim here.\n\n\nAlso, my simplification is really clear: \"I want transactions to be sent faster by quorum, with high level quorum requirements\". In reality, the user is still the main contributor to the security. So, let's go back to the developer community. How many nodes do you really need for a wallet to be secure? Why do you think there's that many wallets? My simplification is really clear: \"I want transactions to be sent faster by quorum, with high level quorum requirements\".

The first is that you don't guarantee that the transaction hashes will be created in a block. If it happens that the input hashes are too short, you might have chain split or some other problem.\n\nWith input hashes being submitted at a fixed and slow time it could even cause deadlock, because multiple people might have to wait for the output hashes of a transaction. There's no such problem with TXO contents.\n\n\nWith direct input addresses, it's obvious that the creator of the address can delete the address at any time. Besides, the creation of the address is part of the transaction. It's an easy to edit and replace transaction.\n\n\nQuote from: vertis0nya on February 22, 2013, 05:20:48 AM By the time the script is executed, fees will be distributed effectively across all nodes of the network. The problem seems to be a code-point distribution and in turn a retarget of the transactions.\n\n\nTx size is not a factor in transactions; total transaction fee is smaller than block size, even if transaction fees have more than tripled. Every time it is greater than the transaction fee and is payable under the assumption that transactions with larger fees lead to a more rapid reduction of the blockchain size.\n\n\nQuote from: vertis0nya on February 22, 2013, 05:20:48 AM All your math on tx fees vs block size is invalid.\n\n\nBecause the assumption that tx fee is proportional to block size is not correct, their figure here is not correct.

Then a single strong machine can go up to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.\n\n\nThat's cool. Please core devs, consider studying what other hard fork changes would be interesting to put in, because we risk hitting the 1Mb limit quite soon. Great posts from Mike and Gavin in this thread. There's indeed no reason to panic over \"too much centralization\". Actually, setting an arbitrary limit (or an arbitrary formula to set the limit) is the very definition of \"central planning\", while letting it get spontaneously set is the very definition of \"decentralized order\".Also, having fewer participants in a market because these participants are good enough to keep aspiring competitors at bay is not a bad thing.

In contrast, Xie Anyi and his two companions were thoroughly delighted with the way the wind and waves and the scenery scoured all of the enemies' plans into dust. They imagined at the time that they were facing the mightiest of all targets.\n\nYes, they were facing this formidable enemy. Xie Anyi had still thought, after the swift ascendancy of the Indomitable Battle Dragon, that this would be a pure chance battle\u2014and he was definitely right.\n\nThe Indomitable Battle Dragon's defense was without doubt very strong. Yet here was the powerhouse of the Battle Dragon Race. The tiny amount of water in the skies here and there did not affect this monster in any way. The question was whether the Royal Sword Sect and the Seventy-Third Division could control it.\n\nThey asked everyone gathered in the ship: \"How is the Imperial Decree managed?\"\n\n\nXiyan's tone was not stern, nor was it bitter. \"Your subordinates are no longer able to control the Indomitable Battle Dragon through any method, so your Dragon Roar Imperial Decree is useless as a method to guard their defenses as well. What are we to do?\"\n\nYan Zhaoge laughed. He replied: \"You're right. After our journey over, the Indomitable Battle Dragon once again reached its limits. Our Imperial Decree has no direct relation to the nature of the Indomitable Battle Dragon. Otherwise, we would have known a ways to silence it easily.\"\n\nThis was true. Even if he could no longer control the Indomitable Battle Dragon, he still knew that he and his men could put it to good use here.\n\nIt would be too dangerous for his soldiers to risk it all, and even more dangerous for the opposing force, if the Indomitable Battleship found out!\n\nThe Seven Star Sword Pool had gathered a vast amount of manpower for the Empire, yet many were unwilling to depend on them. Others had already come to join forces with him. Xie Anyi now first was to take this into consideration.\n\n\"Oh, our Imperial Decree is no longer of any use. We're unable to spare a single soldier to act as our Royal Sword Sect's people.\" Everyone looked at the Seven Star Sword Pool that had even lost its combat capability; the Nine Underworlds had already begun gathering troops. A tyrannical presence now appeared in the sea that had already been freshly filled.\n\nXie Anyi snorted, rolling his eyes, \"It's just a rash thing, looking down on our Royal Sword Sect and others. This is our responsibility as soldiers!\"\n\n\"But before that, in just a day of the journey, they have already wrecked our plans of gathering troops!\"\n\n\"Our Oceanic Domain was already the homeland of the Sky Sword Sect, which had gone on a journey with a Saint Ruler. Their strength already exceeds our team's forces by countless times over. However, none of them can stand on this mountain anymore, like we could. They're currently being chased by Martial Grand Masters!\"\n\n\"Their losses are tremendous, so what's stopping us from letting them go now?\"\n\nHis words seemed to refer solely to that. With that, everyone's gaze gradually turned their way.\n\nXie Anyi saw that their eyes were broad.\n\nAn togas also stood on the deck and stretched his body. Once he was done playing with his archery, he retreated to the distance.\n\nMeanwhile, several more knights continued their lives as one.\n\n\"This guy is too easy to cultivate with, I should consider warning him, say, that this should be limited to a six-month period of time, but the future is not settled yet!\"\n\nYan Zhaoge lowered his gaze from the sky, becoming extremely polite to the Royal Sword Sect's mightily authoritative Sub-Secretary, the Wise Old Man: \"Its Highness Xu Yun, my gaze must still be directed towards the fierce Oceanic Domain, I must look towards this Oceanic Domain which has already lost its crown jewel. If not, what should I worry about? It can now fight back.\"\n\nIn just that brief moment, a figure caught his eye.\n\nSurrounding the Seven Star Sword Pool, the top of the mountain now was harboring a longbow gun, while the boat was leaning over it.\n\nSuddenly, from the water, a figure appeared.\n\nYan Zhaoge's figure disappeared from view, but before he could move, not even a single arrow could be fired\u2014\n\n\nYan Zhaoge did not wait for anyone else to react; he landed, beckoning to another person. The second person", "topp": "Chapter 281 - Flying Wing to Wing\n\n\nTranslated by: Hypersheep325\n\nEdited by: Michyrr\n\n\nNo matter who it was\u2014in an instant, a myriad of flying wing feathers appeared, zipping about, very quick indeed.\n\nHow beautiful it was, like intricate silvery crafts.\n\nJust as Ye Wuchen sensed it, and just as Ye Zichen came back to his senses, it disappeared completely.\n\nAt the same time, there was a rumble at the cockpit.\n\nYe Zichen immediately commanded him to use the Chuben Talisman to recover the points inside his chakram.\n\n\"Chuben talisman!\"\n\nHe didn't take out a talisman. Just as he was planning on getting on the car with Chuben talisman, instantly, a landing zone appeared on the car.\n\n\"It seems the angels have already appeared.\"\n\n\"That's a good sign! Upon arriving here, we'll be far superior than them, so I'm sure they won't dare to come out again.\"\n\nTranslated by: Chua\n\nEdited by: Michyrr\n\n\n\"Wuchen, if you feel comfortable with it, I'll use the Chuben talisman on you.\"\n\nYe Zichen had a wide smile on his face, as he raised the airship towards the sky while he knew that every flying wing he created would get launched into the sky instantly, similarly, his chakram was also launched out after that, after all, Godkings were always right where they wanted to be, so without a doubt, they would stand out.\n\n\"Give me a moment.\"\n\nAfter picking up the Chuben talisman, Ye Zichen urged out.\n\nAs soon as he had returned, he immediately pointed towards a distance away from Chuben talisman.\n\n\"In case there are any flying wing you want to absorb, you can absorb it yourself. Don't hesitate to use it if you need it.\"\n\nAs he said that, Ye Zichen summoned a second Chuben talisman.\n\nHundred miles away, once the two talismans were pointed at where they wanted to go, streaks of golden energy shot from the talisman.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, all of them flew at a higher speed than Chuben talisman, appearing before where Chuben talisman had gone.\n\nGreat, it has regained its speed, we can make it faster!\n\nWithout Ye Zichen's command, the two talismans flew around with extreme speed, leaving behind a strip of golden ground.\n\n\"Moving more quickly than Chuben talisman, it seems like I need to get stronger, obviously!\n\nOnce they walked onto the ground, they could clearly see that Ye Zichen was walking in a strange manner, his face was somewhat pale and wide-mouthed, muttering with a deep mumble and a dull hua.\n\nWhile looking at this, a wave of surprise suddenly appeared in Chen Yiran's eyes, \"It's actually you! Are you already jealous of the Devil Lord? The Devil Lord can take the form of a great dragon and escape from the demons as fast as lightning, and has suffered through many lives, is basically stronger than a human in every respect!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nYe Zichen turned his head to look in Ye Xiwen's direction, himself extremely confused.\n\n\"What in the world does your Dragon Law mean? Do you not understand what being in the dragon power of a cultivator's state does to the body? If your Dragon Law refers to creating a blade of a dragon as a forging blade, then I have to say it refers to watching the instinct of a dragon within it's body in addition to not harming it.\"\n\n\"So you mean you're referring to when a Dragon of the Devils only leaves behind its body.\"\n\n\"I'm the small one\u2014I have no way to attack it!\"\n\nYe Zichen was completely helpless, to tell him the identity of the Dragon Lord was beyond his tolerance.\n\nHis eyes shot towards Serenity in the sky.\n\n\"You've never fought against human beings, have you?\"\n\nThe volume of Ye Zichen's words were infinitely higher.\n\nThe heavens and earth seemed to have both stopped.\n\nYe Xiwen gave off a faint smile as he said, \"Daijiun, I've fought with a few people over the past month, but what can compare to the dragon power of a great dragon? The strength I have to fight with is the power of my own soul. Your planet is one of the few places in the entire world that boasts such a huge dragon power, and it's a low power under my level. The large scale wars that occur within the cold war", "human": "Chapter 281 - Flying Wing to Wing\n\n\nTranslated by: Hypersheep325\n\nEdited by: Michyrr\n\n\nNo matter who it was\u2014in that brief moment she had been unable to clearly make out the other person's appearance\u2014it was definitely one of the human cultivators that had entered the Garden of Zhou. This was enough of a reason. It was enough for Xu Yourong who was flying around Sunset Valley to unsparingly use up her true essence once more to adjust her direction and fly over to that heavily injured and unconscious human cultivator's side. At that critical point where it seemed like she would dash herself to death against the ground, she grabbed the cultivator and flew off into the distance.\n\nShe had no experience in flying with wings, but she had a lot of experience riding the white crane as it soared through the blue sky. As she soared through the night sky, she had none of that imagined unease or terror. But she was just a beginner after all, so it was hard to avoid some improficiency and awkwardness. This was especially the case when considering that she was already heavily wounded and very weak, and that she was now carrying an extra person. It was hard to avoid swaying a bit, giving the appearance that she was drunk.\n\nIt was not too long before Nanke had caught up, only several li behind. Separated by such a distance, she could even feel the killing intent coming from her. She did not turn around, instead focused on learning how to fly. Her wings of fire began to sway less, her posture grew more stable, and her speed began to quicken. Gradually she began to turn into a streak of fire blazing through the night sky.\n\nAfter the awakening of the phoenix soul, she had comprehended many principles, and gained use of much of her innate ability. Solely in terms of speed, she was without a doubt the fastest on the continent. Whether it was the Red Falcons used by the Great Zhou army or the Great Western Continent's Heavenly Messenger Birds, whether it was Nanke or the swift Silver Dragons; none of them could surpass her speed.\n\nThe problem was that she was severely wounded. An even larger problem was that she was currently carrying a person. The person was unconscious, and weighed her down like a wet bag of flour. If she dropped this person, even Nanke would find it very hard to catch up to her. She could go back to the gardens where the rest of the human cultivators had congregated and develop a counterattack against the demon plot. She could also temporarily escape, treat her wounds and the poison in her body, then return to battle Nanke, and this time she believed she would definitely obtain victory.\n\nBut she could not do so, so there was no 'if'.\n\nThis entire time, she had not glanced at the person in her hands\u2014she made no distinction of identity, because no matter what, she could not throw them away. It was just like Nanke had said at the peak of Sunset Valley. From beginning to end, she was an existence burdened with the word 'responsibility'. Many choices had already become a sort of instinct for her. She did not need to ponder them or weigh the pros and cons, she only needed to carry them out.\n\nTwo streams of light skimmed over the forests and wetland at the edge of the plain, their colors only slightly different. Wherever they passed, bits of grass were sent flying and leaves were shocked into puffs of green.\n\nShe had never been able to pull away from Nanke and her vision was starting to go fuzzy. This was a sign that the peacock's poison was beginning to erode her sea of consciousness. She had always been using the Heavenly Phoenix's true blood to suppress it, but over the course of this chase, that blood was gradually being boiled away and was no longer able to suppress the poison. Perhaps she could ignite all the Heavenly Phoenix true blood to go even faster, but then what would she do about the poison?\n\nNanke's figure grew closer and closer and the darkness of the surrounding plain was newly dyed with green. There was no time to think, but in truth, she didn't even think before she made her decision. At this moment, she finally lowered her head to glance at the person in her hands. She helplessly thought to herself, everyone here cultivates the Dao, paying attention to dining with the pure wind and eating the starlight, but just what are you eating every day that you're so heavy?\n\nThen she ignited the meager remnants of the true blood of the Heavenly Phoenix in her body.\n\nWith a boom, the surrounding plains began to burn, and glimmers of light from water could be vaguely seen under the grass.\n\nXu Yourong turned into a streak of fire, and disappeared into the sky.\n\nAfter a while, Nanke arrived", "eta_suffix": " boat was leaning over it.\n\nSuddenly, from the water, a figure appeared.\n\nYan Zhaoge's figure disappeared from view, but before he could move, not even a single arrow could be fired\u2014\n\n\nYan Zhaoge did not wait for anyone else to react; he landed, beckoning to another person.

The area is about 10 miles south of Dublin.\n\nThe plot sits a few blocks from the new VA campus, which the company has repeatedly said is considered a historic site. Some residents of the nearby village are already opposing development in the area and pushing for legislation that would limit construction in the region.\n\nBobby Lopez, retired from the U.S. Army, said he isn't happy with the VA's plan to build on a plot near the new medical complex, named Camp Nottoway, to help victims be relocated. He and others want the new campus to look like a park or garden that residents can walk to, not one that would block access to the cemetery. The new VA campus is expected to open later this year.\n\nBuy Photo Bobby Lopez, retired from the U.S. Army, looks out the window of the court house window as protesters form a human chain around the construction site of the new VA medical campus in Canton on Saturday.

No fax. No fax. No Fax. No fax. No Fax.\"\n\nSome have planned to march on VA offices around the new campus soon. The day after, one of the groups decided to march on the cemetery. But Friday's rally did not start until after the business meeting was concluded and the protesters had planned to walk from the building.\n\nIn the days after the news coverage, VA officials clarified that they have no plans for a cemetery in the western part of the park \u2014 the land west of Highway 70 south of Buckeye on the edge of Crown Hill Cemetery.\n\n\"We respect everyone's right to protest and see how things go,\" said Jon Wolfe, a project manager for the hospital.\n\nBut the Virginia Beach contractor, Wayne International, who is owned by Boston Life Inc., wants to build on the old growth land that backs into a park, said Heather Galloway, owner of the restaurant on Summit Road, which backs into the park.\n\nThe VA plans to bring new housing to the old growth park and plans to allow an expansion of the outdoor recreation space there, said Chris LaBarge, chief executive of the VA's Center for Health Care Administration in Dublin. He said the expanded area would include a medical plaza, an outdoor pet park, and a memorial for the deceased to commemorate its fall and new beginnings. He declined to discuss plans for the construction site.\n\nLaBarge said an agreement with the city allows them to use the cemetery site as a park without closing the old growth forest. The park's designer plans to build a portion of a garage down the road.\n\n\"I am happy to share that we're ready to move forward with construction,\" LaBarge said, adding the VA has also assured him it will follow the condition of the old growth forest.\n\nBuy Photo Opposition to the plan is growing in Crown Hill Cemetery old growth forest.

The VA is planning a monument to hold veterans' urns.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes people who are willing to stand out in the cold,\" said Russ Sipes, an attorney who filed an unsuccessful federal lawsuit seeking to stop the construction project on the site near 42nd Street and Clarendon Road.\n\n\"This whole process was messed up in the beginning because the VA didn't give enough public notice to people.\"\n\nLanette Erby Abbott was among about 12 people who jumped a chain-link fence and moved logs onto the entrance's gravel road. Abbott's left arm was stuffed into a plastic pipe and handcuffed to the right arm of Lori Perdue. Both said they had no plans to leave.\n\n\"We're awaiting confirmation on the length of the stop-work order,\" Abbott said. \"This fight is still not over.\"\n\nAbbott urged those who support their protest to call the VA and elected officials.\n\nProtesters say they will continue using their bodies to block crews from chopping down trees until they are forcibly removed or the VA fully backs off plans to build the monument.\n\n\"We believe we have a moral obligation to protect this irreplaceable forest as all appropriate legislative and judicial channels have been exhausted,\" Perdue, a veteran, said in a statement issued prior to Monday's protests.\n\nThe Indiana Forest Alliance and other environmental groups started pressuring the VA and elected officials in September. Many said they were upset that there were no public hearings held to discuss the plans before the decision was made to cut down the trees.\n\nThe VA bought the 14.75-acre wooded area from Crown Hill for $810,000 in September 2015. The VA plans to build a columbarium, an above-ground monument that will hold about 2,500 urns.

Crown Hill was selected for its history and natural beauty, Glenn Powers, a deputy undersecretary of Veterans Affairs, told the hostile crowd of about 250 at the Indiana War Memorial Downtown.\n\n\"The issue is Marion is a distance for the veterans,\" Powers said, drawing hoots and jeers during that Sept. 29 meeting. \"The core of the population is located a great distance.\"\n\nU.S. Sen.

This compares to 32.3 per cent of all Irish Travellers aged over 17.\n\nIreland has the lowest proportion of Irish Travellers with 2.6 per cent of the population being Irish Travellers.\n\nThe official figure of 2.6 per cent of the population is based on National Statistics definitions as Travellers were defined as having been born in, or naturalised as, the UK and have resided in Ireland for at least two generations.\n\nThe Central Statistics Office said:\n\nDue to the relatively low prevalence of Irish Travellers, the current statistics include only those who reported having contact with our health service over a five year period between April 2009 and March 2012. The figures released today reflect the five year periods since those five year periods. In the five years between April 2009 and March 2012 some 51,060 adults had a first response to the Health Service Attitudes survey in which they indicated they used the service. Over the period these 59,559 people were contacted for a second response (via telephone or in-person). The second series of queries also included respondents who self-identified as Irish Travellers as part of the population-based Census survey and provided an accurate estimate for persons who identified themselves as Traveller to this extent (Laferton et al., 2011, p. 1003). Of those Irish Travellers who self-identified as Traveller, nearly eight out of ten claimed to use the health service. Overall, a significant proportion of all Irish Travellers aged over 17 years have made use of our health service and a large proportion also have used our health service at a very high rate. Irish Travellers aged 17 to 25 years had an uptake of 19.7 per cent while the Irish Traveller group of persons aged over 25 years had a 16.4 per cent uptake. The current statistics are based on the online Health Service Attitudes survey, which continues to increase the diversity of the population and contains several features which can be especially useful for medical research. As this survey only interviews people who have asked for information, the difference between the average uptake of the health service for Irish Travellers compared with other ethnic groups is likely to be relatively small. The latest data on Irish Traveller uptake of the Health Service Attitudes survey is published in the latest tables of the Irish Travellers Census, released today. These show an increase in uptake of approximately six percent since the second series of queries was carried out in April 2010.

This figure represents an overall increase in use (6.6 %) over the estimates of 37.7 % for the six-quarter period ending April 2013. The increase in uptake is explained by a number of factors including: an increase in numbers being contacted by the health", "topp": "Press Statement\n\nPreasr\u00e1iteas\n\nProfile 8 - Irish Travellers Ethnicity and Religion\n\nThe Central Statistics Office (CSO) today (Thursday, 28 June) released the demographic profile of Irish Traveller people in Ireland.\n\nSome 56.6% of Irish Travellers reported that their main ethnic origin is Ireland and 85.9% said they were predominantly Catholic. This was a minor increase on the percentage of people identifying their ethnicity as Irish (51.7%) in the 2011 census.\n\nLooking at ethnicity, nearly 80% of Irish Travellers identified as Irish Travellers (84.7% in 2011) and 6.9% identified as non-Irish Travellers (10.3%). Of those identifying as non-Irish Travellers, 19.8% were from Northern Ireland and 6.8% came from the Republic.\n\nAround 8% of Irish Travellers were in the Traveller population in England and Wales in 2011 and 12.2% were in the Traveller population in Scotland.\n\nStatus of Irish Traveller people\n\nAround 57% of Irish Traveller people (2.5 million people or 1.2% of the Irish population) lived on their own, around 52% lived with people in the home, only 17% lived with others outside the home.\n\nRelations with Travellers\n\nAlmost two thirds (64%) of Irish Traveller people had a positive view of Travellers (16.4% with a very positive and 15.4% with a neutral view).\n\nAround a quarter (25%) of Irish Traveller people (1.4 million people or 5% of the Irish population) reported that they worked for one of the Republic's Labour parties. Around 11% reported working for either the Greens, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (government) or Parlaimed TDs. This compares with a 6% share of the population nationally.\n\nWhile only 5% of Irish Traveller people claimed, were pensioners, this was a 22% increase from a decade earlier and the highest ever proportion of pensioners. A further 41% of Irish Traveller people (13.1 million people or 13.6% of the Irish population) said they were not over the age of 65, compared with 3.4% nationally.\n\nWelsh Travellers\n\nIreland has the largest contingent of Travellers living in Wales. The CSO figures show some 1,072 Irish Travellers living in Wales. These Travellers are mostly identified as Welsh Travellers. Irish Travellers were more likely than other Travellers to say they were married (47.9% compared with 29.4%) or had children (37.1% compared with 29.1%). This follows on from the 2011 census where 46% of Travellers in Wales said that they were married, against 35% nationally.\n\nOver the four census cycles since 1981, some 540,000 Welsh Travellers have immigrated to Ireland. However, these numbers include those that leave Ireland via the north door only and a small number of those who take up residence in Wales.\n\nWhile the overall immigration stream of Irish Travellers and other Travellers has remained steady, net inward migration from Ireland has generally increased over the last decade. In 2011, inward migration accounted for 31.4% of the total number of people arriving in Ireland, while 32.9% arrived here as immigrants.\n\nFigures on the financial flows of Irish Travellers also show that some 4.2% of those arriving in Ireland in 2011 were in self-employment. More than one in five arrived in the last three or more years as self-employed workers. The share of self-employed workers entering the labour force peaked in 2011 at 26%, but has now fallen to around 21% (also down slightly on the 2011 figure).\n\nPercentages of non-EEA nationals of Irish Travellers\n\nThe LOD (Low Levels of Deprivation) and Lithuania DSA groups continue to be on a downward trend and the LOD (Low Levels of Deprivation) group was held steady at 32.3%. Numbers in the Lithuania DSA group have fallen from 16,930 in 2006 to 12,338 in 2010, while numbers in the LOD (Low Levels of Deprivation) group have remained constant at 34,363.\n\nCitizenship and Irish Traveller Identity\n\nThe Government is working closely with the Irish Traveller Action Group to aim for a comprehensive new dialogue with all components of the community and development of an Irish Traveller legislation that will reflect the ongoing regeneration of Ireland through the country's economic growth and modernisation.\n\nThe Government is also responding through funding for various anti-oppression and anti-violence programs from the Oireachtas Regional Development Agencies through the Roadmap for Equality and Justice Programme (RDO).\n\nResearch Highlights\n\nImmigration Trends - Number of people admitted in 2011\n\n7.

The report shows that the number of Irish Travellers stood at 30,987, representing 0.7% of the general population in April 2016. The report also details how both the proportion and total number of Catholics have fallen since 2011, with Catholics comprising 78.3% of the population in April 2016, down from 84.2% in 2011, while the number of people with no religion (including atheists and agnostics) increased by 73.6% to stand at 481,388 in 2016.\n\nDeirdre Cullen, Senior Statistician, commented: \"This report, the eighth of eleven thematic reports of Census 2016 results, provides further insight into the demographic structure of our population, this time looking at religion, ethnicity and Irish Travellers. These themes are examined by age, social class, and household composition. As always all of this information is available on www.cso.ie, where users can also access detailed data for their own area\".\n\nToday's full report is available on the CSO website at Census 2016 - Profile 8 Irish Travellers, Ethnicity and Religion\n\nHighlights from Profile 8 Irish Travellers, Ethnicity and Religion\n\nIrish Travellers\n\nIrish Travellers and Age Structure\n\nThere were 30,987 usually resident Irish Travellers enumerated in Census 2016, an increase of 5.1% on the 2011 figure (29,495). Almost 60% of Travellers were aged under 25, compared with just 33.4% of the general population. There were just 451 Traveller men aged 65 and over and 481 Traveller females.\n\nWhere Travellers live\n\nTravellers were more urbanised than the general population with almost 8 in 10 (78.6%) living in cities or towns (of 1,500 or more), compared with 62.4% of the total population. Dublin city and suburbs had the largest number of Irish Travellers with 5,089 persons. This was followed by Galway city and suburbs with 1,598 persons and Cork city and suburbs with 1,222.\n\nAmong towns with 1,500 or more persons, Tuam had the highest number of Irish Travellers with 737 persons, followed by Longford with 730 persons. Navan, Mullingar, Dundalk and Ballinasloe all had 500 or more Irish Travellers in 2016.\n\nTraveller households\n\nThere were 8,717 Traveller households (defined as households containing at least one Irish Traveller) in April 2016, an increase of 12.3% on April 2011. Traveller households were more likely to be multiple family, 4.2% compared with 1.3% of the general population, but less likely to be one-person households, 11.0% compared with 23.6%.\n\nMarital status\n\nIn April 2016 31.9% of Travellers, aged 15 to 29, were married compared with just over 1 in 20 (5.8%) of the general population. The divorce rate was less than half that of the general population, 2.2% compared to 4.7%.\n\nEducation\n\nEducational attainment among Travellers continues to lag significantly behind that of the general population. Among Traveller females, just 13.3% were educated to upper secondary level or above, compared with almost 7 in10 (69.1%) of the general population. Nearly 6 in 10 male Travellers (57.2%) were educated to primary level at most, compared with just 13.6% of the general population. The 167 Travellers with a third-level qualification was almost double the 2011 figure of 89.\n\nEmployment/Unemployment\n\nWhile 10,653 Travellers were in the labour force, the vast majority, 8,541 (80.2%), were unemployed. Almost 1 in 8 Travellers (11.3%) stated that they were unable to work due to a disability, which was almost three times the rate of the general population (4.3%).\n\nEthnicity\n\nEthnic composition\n\n\"White Irish\" remains by far the largest group, accounting for 3,854,226 (82.2%) usual residents. This was followed by \"Any other White background\" (9.5%), non-Chinese Asian (1.7%) and \"other incl. mixed background\" (1.5%). The 19,447 persons with Chinese ethnic/cultural background made up 0.4% of the usually resident population, while those of mixed backgrounds (70,603) constituted 1.5%.\n\nBirthplace\n\nThe vast majority (94.1%) of White Irish people were born in Ireland.

His goal was to regrow his garden but didn't want to back up my showpiece. So, he decided to take it elsewhere. This year, after a lot of hauling around and pruning, he succeeded by re-growing a magnificent white-flowered heather that lasted four years. So long, old man! My little green plant!

I dicked around with it for a bit but it seemed to lack the weight to try and climb or hang itself by its roots to try to get somewhere. I was watching and listening and listening and my only interest in this plant is in the plants it produces. The darker green color seems to really bring out the true flowers which give it its name, which is to say the black flower clusters that fall out easily as the plants are young. It takes 5 to 6 weeks to mature to start the plants and 9 to 11 weeks to mature when they are harvested so have to plant them in full pots in one after another. If you have no patience with this growing habit you will just have to plant them up in piles somewhere and enjoy the blooming colors of the buds/flower clusters falling down. There is a moody blooming plant, a all-around very powerful plant, that is what kept the house full of stuffy fog on a chilly afternoon during last fall, and was also required that gardeners put up so many odds and ends and even the library on the porch if their plan. Never thought I'd be doing that, or listening to my garden just because there is a plot of it nearby. They have to stop producing seeds before they die off. I did not plant them further up this year.

The \"rule against raising Rule 22 or similar motions to have this court overrule a prior decision is governed by the'substance' rule of rules 20(b) and 21(b).\" \"Rule 22 is the'substance rule' in Brady,\" Wharton concludes. \"Rule 22 concerns the punishment of a crime. Rule 26 addresses whether the penalty imposed upon the defendant for the alleged crime was too high.\" MacTaggart, 709 So.2d at 535 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause appellant failed to meet the requirements of the present Rule 22 motion, the Honorable Dan Brown determined that he lacked jurisdiction over appellant's amended Rule 22. On June 29, 2010, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the amended rule in federal court pursuant to United States Code Section 481(e)(9) (20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 481(e)(9)).\n\nThe subject of appellant's Rule 22 motion was whether it could be established that a violation occurred in an airplane, that is a well-know, excusable violation. It was established that the conduct at issue was \"akin to the picket line with an airplane\" and that the plane was operated by a flight instructor on board the airplane. Appellant's motion also discussed whether there was evidence of a prosecution for a crime such as assault with the intent to commit murder or assault in the first degree, but it did not state the facts of that complaint. Specifically, appellant's motion alleged, as follows:\n\nTHE HEARING IN THIS CASE, WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT BEING FORMED BY DR. KAPLAN and WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTY EVIDENCE OBTAINED BY THE JURY AT THE BART'S INSTRUCTION OF THE MERITS, IS ALSO OPINION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT MANY OTHER THAN A FEW DEFINITIONS APPEAR OUTLINEED IN ADAMSON APPEARANCE IN COURT ABOVE, SUCH AS DENIAL OF A RIGHT TO ARREST, WILL ADEQUATE FOR A MATTERS THAT FAR MATCH THE VIOLATIONS WHICH, FOR THE SUPPOSED CIRCUMSTANCES, POSSIBLY WERE SEEN IN A CERTAIN LATERING PREDICTION IN WEATHER WEAKNESSES.\n\nAppellant contends that the preliminary hearing in which he entered his plea on August 8, 2010 was outside the frame of reference of the prior federal appeal proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Appellant claims the Department of Justice was conducting an old D.C. Circuit Rule 12(b)(6) case on the afternoon of the appeal. The Department of Justice was represented by the District of Columbia Bureau of Law Enforcement (DBLE).

In response, Wyeth argued that Section 22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (\"NCVIA\") exempted vaccine manufacturers from all design-defect claims, including the one asserted by the Bruesewitz family. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Wyeth and dismissed the claim. The Supreme Court must now determine whether to sustain the categorical preclusion of all design-defect claims advanced against vaccine manufacturers, or whether to expose vaccine manufacturers to potential design-based litigation. This decision will affect the right of vaccine victims to seek compensation for their injuries and the ability of vaccine manufacturers to avoid costly litigation that may drive them out of the vaccine market.\n\nQuestion presented\n\nWhether the Third Circuit erred in holding that, contrary to its plain text and the decisions of this Court and others, section 22(b)(1) preempts all vaccine design defect claims, whether the vaccine's side effects were unavoidable or not?\n\ntop\n\nIssue\n\nWhether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act provides a blanket immunity to vaccine manufacturers from tort actions filed in state or federal court by injured victims seeking compensation for injuries allegedly arising from defectively designed vaccines.\n\ntop\n\nFacts\n\nThis case turns on the Supreme Court's interpretation of the word \"unavoidable\" as it is used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (\"NCVIA\"). See Bruesewitz v. Wyeth Inc., 561 F.3d 233, 245 (3d Cir. 2009). The plaintiffs, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz (\"the Bruesewitzes\") claim that, among other factors, poor design of the vaccine TRI-IMMUNOL (\"DTP\") by vaccine manufacturer Wyeth, Inc. (\"Wyeth\") caused an injury to their daughter, Hannah Bruesewitz (\"Hannah\"). See id. at 237.\n\nHannah was six months old when she received her third scheduled injection of DTP on April 1, 1992. See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236. Shortly after the injection, Hannah began experiencing seizures. See id. The seizures persisted and the Bruesewitzes counted 126 seizures over a sixteen-day period. See Brief for Petitioners, Russell Bruesewitz and Robalee Bruesewitz at 19\u201320. Eventually, these seizures left Hannah lethargic, developmentally stunted, and displaying autistic-like symptoms. See id. at 20. In 2003, doctors diagnosed Hannah with a residual seizure disorder and encephalopathy. See id. Because of these conditions, Hannah will likely require lifelong medical care. See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236.\n\nDespite the success of DTP in reducing pertussis (or \"whooping cough\") infections, the Bruesewitzes contend that Wyeth and other medical professionals and organizations were aware of several adverse effects associated with the vaccine. See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236. In fact, Hannah's injection was drawn from a vaccine lot that had over sixty-five complaints of adverse reactions filed with the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"). See id. Of these, thirty-nine resulted in emergency room visits, six in hospitalizations, and two in death. See id. In retrospect, Hannah's physician insists that had she been aware of the incidents associated with this lot, she would not have administered the vaccine. See id.\n\nThe Bruesewitzes contend that Hannah's injuries could have been avoided had Wyeth used an alternate design called ACEL-IMUNE (\"DTaP\"). See Bruesewitz, 561 F.3d at 236. However, though the FDA approved DTaP in 1991, the approval extended to only the fourth and fifth injections following three scheduled injections of the DTP formula. See id.

If the goal is to get a blacklist of Bitcoin exchanges, perhaps even to prosecute them for running Bitcoin services, then we should adopt such an approach. Now, when they have legitimate and important businesses, we could provide assistance to them while we pursue exchanges and hegemonic nodes. A \"snatch and grab\" policy should be avoided, in which the authorities would seize funds of the alt-coin mining operations and assets of the Bitcoin projects, as we have seen in the famous \"Dire Fork\".\n\n\nI think a snatch and grab would be even worse, and would only take away the legitimate projects or people, before executing them. If any of the three governments were interested in Bitcoin exchanges, I think they would consider that a good idea (especially because the value of Bitcoins can only float outside the borders of these countries).\n\n\nThe governments might claim that they have no evidence, on technical or otherwise, that Bitcoin exists and is a valid commodity. But I am sure that they would have more proof, including video evidences of people actually using Bitcoin. In my opinion, and with a whole lot of \"kudos\" coming from \"Kraken\", you should've tried that.\n\n\nEven though I am sure that no \"Apostles of Finance\", all rich individuals and financial actors like Mr. E.P. Thompson, could easily hand out billions of dollars to make a valid argument for a drug war, the solution is the same. For instance, if the founders of blockchain.info still had the abilities to create meaningful transactions, they could, with no legal trouble, go to a Bank of England branch, open a bank account, trade in Bitcoins, and then hand out a token of payment, the so called E-coin. They could run a test net like this, one with 1000 of these coin and give the rest as \"bad money\" to few connected users, who would then risk receiving funds from a large number of providers for each block they added. And I am sure even those \"bankers,\" that would give the \"bad money\" to a small number of people, would work with the same type of mechanism. Because even though, before the advent of large crypto currencies the use of bitcoin to finance the development of blockchain.info and its customers was successful, after the fiat money problem came, the bank would not be as strong as now. The whole affair would quickly unravel.\n\n\nSo what could be done? I do not know, but with the current level of crypto exchange rate, \"Fiat money\" is very well accepted to the point that there is no possibility of any outgo for Bitcoin. In my opinion, the first step to collect the \"bad money\" is the \"Denial of Service\" attack, which would allow a \"big Daddy\" attacker to automatically \"Deny Service\" to others on their network. The basis of this attack is the users' intention to use the Tor service, a protection against surveillance and a shield against government agents. The situation, at the moment, is not very good, but I think it might change in a short time. But yes, a \"snatch and grab\" of any kind in crypto crypto, no matter how valuable, would be worse, because most of the major crypto holders of Bitcoin (including myself) don't depend on cryptocurrency for the financial services we need today. I think a snatch and grab would be even worse, and would only take away the legitimate projects or people, before executing them. If any of the three governments were interested in Bitcoin exchanges, I think they would consider that a good idea (especially because the value of Bitcoins can only float outside the borders of these countries).The governments might claim that they have no evidence, on technical or otherwise, that Bitcoin exists and is a valid commodity. But I am sure that they would have more proof, including video evidences of people actually using Bitcoin. In my opinion, and with a whole lot of \"kudos\" coming from \"Kraken\", you should've tried that.Even though I am sure that no \"Apostles of Finance\", all rich individuals and financial actors like Mr. E.P. Thompson, could easily hand out billions of dollars to make a valid argument for a drug war, the solution is the same. For instance, if the founders of blockchain.info still had the abilities to create meaningful transactions, they could, with no legal trouble, go to a Bank of England branch, open a bank account, trade in Bitcoins,", "topp": "cryptoanarchist\n\n\nOffline\n\n\nActivity: 1120\n\nMerit: 1000\n\n\nLegendaryActivity: 1120Merit: 1000 Peter Vessenes: Take a risk with bitcoin?

ASICMINER does not pay its dividends (minting new coins) right away. In a way, such announcement may be a good thing to encourage investors and suck into the market and drop valuations and release IOTA from the blockchain (insert funny meme here). I say it is possible because most of the other funds I am holding already hold BTC. The former had lost 50 percent of its value since the beginning of last week. Being shorter term, I am willing to wait and see whether or not in 2018, BTC-TC, SBC, nChain and their like merge BTC investment funds into the BTC fund. Let the cryptocurrency boom bloom, follow its consistent upward trend and then, like Bitcoin, destroy currencies in similar way.Thus, I have unashamedly staked the coins of BitUSD, btsx, SBC and BTC. I have two little half-empty secret hand-me-down snacks (sorry, good case of pemmican-descended congealed pus) in my bag that I'll leave out of everything else I've purchased or accumulated since I've started losing value. I bought 2 BTC, just last week from 15-year-old, in kiev. That is not a big return, but I did save enough to free my life in July, after a car accident.

This program is GREAT! I had to take an R2 D's class for biker's that are too lazy to get legit classes...thanks, Bikers!\n\nThis is a great program! Once again, thank you for the flexibility.\n\n\nMARCO\n\n\nI have been like this for as long as I can remember. The beginnings of the Vehicle Manager Program I believe were a direct response to the rampant problem of vehicle theft in rural areas. The equipment included in the program was very economical and it was easy to get on the road.\n\n\nSome people wanted the motorcycles, because no one else was going to sell them. The shop would do it for them, then they would charge a lot more. The second group ran around being greedy and demanding that they be included because there were so few people who might be interested.\n\n\nMy third group were limited to one truck with a full/full truck, a trailer and 4 motorcycles of various types. Some of these motocrossers were on some of the best motocross boards on the face of the earth and they just didn't make sense to own.\n\n\nThe final group was a group of factory trucks, which were in the category of the class 4 or 5 van. If we were talking frugal Ford truck owners, they needed to have more than 2 practical uses. There were a couple of brand new Ford F150's in that group, but they were still considering stripping it down to the frame.\n\n\nThe idea was to make an investment with everything, just for the sake of a vehicle that would be reliable and good for a long time.\n\n\nThis was the suggestion made by the outset, but I had less concerns about the diversity of the classes than those of the two main groups. In general, to me, a driving class seems pretty much \"civilized\" and a motocross class kind of wild and quirky. If we could write a curriculum to maintain that continuity, that would be awesome, but perhaps impossible to do.\n\n\nWell, this class has worked out very well.\n\nI really appreciate the changes in the way rules have been set up. I worked hard to maintain my bank account, but now that I have been \"in\" a few years, I've come to enjoy my money a bit more.\n\n\nThe program is no longer restricted to only Ford and F150's, so I think the Ford Explorer F-150 may have captured the popular imagination. They will really benefit from it.\n\n\nBig thanks to Phil and Marlona on the R2D design team for helping make this program work.\n\n\nThank you to all the staff, who provided the following example: Long ways and most miles of all workouts, most city/highway miles and run training.\n\nMost steps per mile first, then mileage.\n\n\nHow many miles will this car take, to reach 5,000? 11,500??? AND, imagine to drive this and have wind too!\n\n\nThere are probably some interesting modifications coming up.\n\n\nI've got some additional work, if anyone is interested.\n\nI designed the engine hoses to feed the power from my rockers.\n\nI'm in the process of installing a duplicate pump, and behind the radiators is where I'll mount a second pump.\n\nI'll be doing leg and slack work along with a lot of radius work\n\nAnother cool piece was the steering system. I want to create an optimum angle for the force applied. I need 2 toggles, one at both ends. There's a Y seat, which I've been testing against a Xenon seat.\n\nI'm pretty pleased with the weight and. They give me lots of power while running, but it's very twitchy in my hands when doing cuts.\n\nPower is coming from a single cylinder that is seated on a detachable axle. It will spin with the clutch and away.

We've also got the first results of the new Weekly Screentime, which is a sort of preseason tournament run by Blizzard. The Weekly Screentime will feature 12 matches hosted on EU server only, with the final three matches played on NA server.\n\n\nA new Battleground has been added to the weekly, Ilios:\n\n- Ilios is a map that was proposed by Blizzard, and is interesting in a variety of ways. It features a temple which has been abandoned a few years ago and contains the last remaining Undead remaining in the world. The flag is also a new Horde-themed hero.\n\n- Although Ilios features a nice long drawn out siege game, we've seen that the old Drunken Brawler gets lost in \"simple\" scenarios quite a lot. A huge part of the \"modern\" version of this map is the very old Haunted Mines setup, which will definitely be revamped.\n\n\nAs you can see below, Blizz is currently testing out four Battlegrounds:\n\n- Cursed Hollow\n\n- Atlantis\n\n- Volskaya Industries\n\n- The Foundry\n\n\nFinally, the detailed maps for the Special Tournament have been revealed:\n\n- Tracer Hanamura \u2013 An interchanging HEMT style map where the payload isn't in sight. Tensions are high as 4 turrets are positioned against the payload. An exploit exists where Tassadar can move from behind the payload onto the other side and grab the payload. An obvious split-second choke point can be found on the walls to the right of the payload (that is clearly opened at the side). The good players can always send the payload away and a good team will make sure they're either picking off or scouting the payload.\n\n- Sombra Hanamura \u2013 A classic mid-range map that really needs a hero that can focus fire. Basically it's a massive open area of constant enemy fire that rarely drops any payload on the map besides the flag with the turret in the center.\n\n- Winston Blackwatch \u2013 A map that does well on the map of Team Objective Mode. Winston and some other heroes need to build up an upper hand to get at least two towers to their side of the map and find the Heroes that are sitting on the platforms in the center. As this is a 2v2 map it does seem like there will also be some Hero Split-Piggybacking where one player in the middle is too far away to actually impact the game itself, which isn't going to work on a map like this.\n\n\nBlizzard has also released a trailer featuring Sombra's hero, which you can watch in the full video at\n\nThe new Weekly Screentime has its first match on EU server only later today. In addition to that, the EU side has also revealed it is practicing on the TeamStory Cup Tournament. You can find more information about that on the official page. A complete report of the Season 1 Blizzard Patch will be available as soon as it is released later this night.The first full overview of the game's Season 1 is out, revealing four Battlegrounds, one Special Tournament, and some new features \u2013 see the (confirmed so far) new Hero Blackhardt.As you can see in the poster above,will feature very varied maps, that is in a true competitive Hearthstone style. It looks like all eight heroes will have access to the same options as standard Heroes, with some special effects.Because Blizzard does not exactly have a strict rating system for Hearthstone, they've been developing their own metric based on several different factors. All players will unlock all abilities of different ranks.The new Battlegrounds are also being released with the release of the Season 1 of Blizzard's Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft. We've also got tentative results of the Hero Selection Window.The all new event will run from June 16th through the end of the week, featuring traditional BeYonkers, Digital Libation, and Starcraft 2. The event is presented by CCI, and features an awesome music and graphics theme!The first PvP tournament is also revealed. This one focuses on Team Random Event Mode, and is hosted on the EU Server only. This event pits 13 players vs. 4 players in a TvT, showing that there is a strong PvP community in the EU Region. The event will end on July 13th, and the winner of the event will take home a free month of the World of Warcraft membership (which was released yesterday). The Tavern brawl is also confirmed.The final Battleground in the beta test has been announced. The new Battleground is Haunted Mines, and has been announced by Blizzard recently.In spite of the Goblins being one of the more popular Heroes over the last few years, there is", "topp": "Waxangel Profile Blog Joined September 2002 United States 26728 Posts Last Edited: 2014-05-19 03:49:57 #1\n\n\nVariety is reporting that they have an investor lined up, so it's likely going to happen in the first half of this year. That would mean that it'll be just after the lans and before 2013 Spring Playoffs. Last year, Nexon first announced plans for a Dota 2 team earlier in the year, with their games studio facing the possibility of closing down.

Before starting his organization, EVT advertised on a Chinese team website last year, with a majority of the roster later being acquired by Pentagram, who became known as the most well-known Chinese Team Secret in the scene. Since then, EVT has not grown substantially, and can only count on players like Tai 'Hai' Lam and Tong 'pieliedie' Yi who have ended up moving on to other squads. But with a new investor, EVT might just be able to make a serious push this year.\n\n\nWith this news and the addition of Kuroky, there's a big chance we will start seeing a few NA teams attending more LANs. NA has a total of eight teams per division, so it makes sense that they'd be experimenting with Dota. Last year was also the first year that Infinity Seven, an Indonesian Dota team made up of ex-SK Telecom T1 players, was able to place in the top three at DAC.\n\n\nThe new lineup will be known as the Aces, and will most likely require a new mid laner. There will be a field of applicants to take the team down, and in the league above them, two people are for sure not going to get in. Team Courage recently tried to have Vici Gaming join the Alliance lineup, but after it failed to gain traction, they disbanded as well.\n\n\nThe following teams are on the brink of going pro:\n\n\n--KuroKy.Yahiya - posted in an interview on Alibaba's website. He's also a co-owner with a SEA based Chinese company EVT. AH's development is going great, I really want to support it. Na`Vi looks good too, as do all of the teams without names: LGD-Gaming, Mineski, Mineski Red, etc.The teams will have to qualify for four slots at the World Championship in the meantime, after all. A few are still in the early stages, and are most likely subject to practice with the team before they get to the main event.Variety is reporting that they have an investor lined up, so it's likely going to happen in the first half of this year. That would mean that it'll be just after the lans and before 2013 Spring Playoffs.

{"eta": "UPDATE: This post was pretty popular. I've posted a followup This post was pretty popular. I've posted a followup here\n\nAfter two months of Sol Trader, this is a question many of you are asking yourself, which is why I'm republishing it now.\n\nI recently received an email on the Sol Trader subreddit that read\n\nHey who the hell are you? I have a Question! \"Hi Andrew, I've been on board for 20 years on the platform. The revenue model is working for several years and with successful projects they make enormous amount of money, and yet I look on it like it is a sham\" I have a question. Am I right or wrong, am I fool or a prophet? If you are correct in believing that the platform is a non-profit, then why is people coming into the platform seeking its donations? I have a question. I am an Amazon Prime member and using Amazon Prime benefits me but I have a question, does it matter that you are a member? I have a question that I'm going to go with the crowd, What do you get and when are they going to be released?\n\nMy question about the sales model is really this. First of all, who are you? Are you an Amazon Prime member who takes advantage of the free trial period to \"check out\" the platform?\n\nIf you are correct, then it should be pretty easy to understand why you'd get this.\n\nIn three months of using the platform, you have made between $8,000 and $12,000 from income made from selling, and around $3,000 has been earned in commissions.\n\nThat sounds good to me.\n\nThere's a few other things worth mentioning to set the context of this.\n\nFirst, let me say that I understand that part of my job as a member is to find good products to sell and guide people on where to buy them. However, you are not likely to be watching recommendations and product recommendations when you use the platform. I can walk you through my progress here, but please do not feel like I'm rating some products or topics on Amazon, they are rarely talked about.\n\nSecondly, it's worth considering the business model that Amazon uses. There are a handful of revenue generating merchants to list, and while they can individually make a pile of money from this model (due to Amazon's vanity pricing), it's far less than the $8k and $10k you will be making from selling products on Sol Trader.\n\nIn the over a year, they have likely made somewhere between $5k and $40k per month, as a fractional business model. If you had the satisfaction of doing that same work for Amazon that you could do for Sol Trader, I'd be impressed.\n\nIf you're thinking about joining the platform to support Amazon, you're probably making a mistake. No matter what the above screed says, I'm sure that you would make a ton of money selling any or all of these products. The three months of profits on that are getting him thinking.\n\nIf you think you might make a lot of money making these commissions, why not consider following the guide by Justomeverywhere and writing a product review article?\n\n6. Money-Saving Mistakes\n\nThis one I found as well. I actually do have some money-saving tips and tricks I can point to, though I also think I've missed a few. This one pertains to the impact of business on your credit history.\n\nConsider the argument as follows:\n\nIf you have a pending credit score, then anything you do is essentially affected by which federal and state credit bureaus say I can apply for credit. (e.g., I can't use a credit card until I have a fully applied $5000+ credit history, or a 35% downpayment payment is a subprime condition, or I can't use a car until I have a 30% downpayment\u2026depending on what the law allows for).\n\nIn short, do you really want to say something like this?\n\n\"I am using a credit card that I pay monthly, and if I have a finance charge the next month, it's going to impact my credit, and if I have a finance charge the following month, it's going to impact my credit, and so that I may be entitled to a credit freeze earlier so that I can pay my bills and negotiate the best deals with other people.\"\n\nI've even heard people who can't even close a consumer credit card application explain as such.\n\nI think that's a mistake.\n\nInstead, try closing the application, accepting a lower fee, or demonstrating your ability to pay your balance quickly. If you don't do that, it simply means that you are in default on your CFPB charge.\n\nWith many credit card policies, you can pull your account and close immediately after making a payment", "topp": "UPDATE: This post was pretty popular. I've posted a followup This post was pretty popular. I've posted a followup here\n\nAfter two months of Sol Trader Adventures and two more months of no help from Sol Trader, I contacted the airport police on behalf of Martina Kelly to see if she'd seen anything suspicious.\n\nI asked her to note down for me any suspicious motion or otherwise, and to call me in when she saw anything that looked unusual. She said, \"Just let me keep watch on you.\"\n\nBy that time, I no longer feared her the way I once had. I was invited into the hotel room with her to meet with her boyfriend and see if he was coming to the airport to hide me. When the boyfriend arrived, he was visibly shaking. It felt like his lungs were on fire. He handed me a letter pleading with me to help him leave. In it, he said, \"You may only have been in three hotel rooms as I didn't even check the rest before I went in. So if you find something suspicious, come clean.\" I held up the letter and told him that the family he'd moved to America from were saying that the mother who brought him in was planning to sell him off on the black market. He asked for my home address and just where I lived, like he always requested. He'd been made to worry about me, and I agreed to help him.\n\nIn our next four months, we began life living apart in a car, riding around to different locations in American and Canadian provinces. We kept in touch on the phone frequently, but we exchanged nothing except basic information on the basics\u2014my boyfriend's address, the phone number I'd put on the letter, and since we owned two trucks, his name. We'd see each other one week, meet for coffee or a bite to eat. He'd give me advice and mock my sweet tooth, and then fall silent for hours.\n\nAlthough our lives had stayed apart, we kept in touch a lot on social media. Our closest friend in the UK\u2014she's German and a fashion pro, and I like German girls in general\u2014started discussing Sol Trader with me on Instagram. She told me she'd heard that the Sol Trader's hotel room was very guarded, and asked whether I had any bad experiences there. I said that I'd had a bad experience at one hotel, and was warned to stay away from others. She asked whether I'd ever got kidnapped. I said, \"No.\" She asked if I'd gone off by myself and picked up girls. I said no, that I'd stayed with a close friend, and the friend had told her about it. She asked if I'd had a version of my story arranged so I could get off the plane safely. I said that would be a shame, because I felt we were \"ready for it.\" She asked if I would be willing to donate to the Safe Air Foundation to show me how to escape for the day. I said I was going to kill myself if I couldn't get home. But the next day she sent me an image of a sign: \"No Hostile Energy No Pets No Alcohol.\" In which she thought of the image of the American child held captive and below a photo of the prison bars as being representative. \"Is that taken straight from Sol Trader?\" she asked. I said, \"Yes.\" \"That's probably the only copy of it that exists online.\"\n\nThis was the final time that we had to contact her.\n\nOn March 28, the following day, I went with my boyfriend and shared this story with hundreds of others on social media.\n\nAbe deleted his last post\u2014his last public post as an Instagram model\u2014and blocked me. The next day the hotel owner sent me a longer reply, explaining that the guests were \"asking for Sol Trader\" and threatening to send a team of security guards to our hotel. It was enough to sink my hopes for the Sol Trader dream and about as close to a death sentence as I could have imagined\u2014if only we had been less na\u00efve. But hey, I had to get rid of my friend before I could explain to my parents what had just happened.\n\nMartina disappeared from social media after Sol Trader disappeared from Facebook. I started sharing her story with friends and other Sol Trader scammers on Google+, but this led to catfishing, which is basically hacking attempts to mess with people's identities. I kept my Google+ account open on my phone and messaging people to check on her status, but there was nothing to indicate that she'd ever deleted her account\u2014not even a message telling me she had. Her apps eventually stopped working. \"Suddenly she seemed like she had been burned,\" Mike told me on Tuesday.\n\nTrouble began when I postulated that she might have been sold off on the black market. \"She had the habits I'd see with Sol Trader,\" Mike said. \"But she was taking a", "human": "UPDATE: This post was pretty popular. I've posted a followup This post was pretty popular. I've posted a followup here\n\nAfter two months of Sol Trader development in Ruby, I took a difficult decision last Wednesday morning: I've decided to rewrite the game code from scratch in C++. Let me explain my reasons.\n\nIf you'd like to purchase Sol Trader you can now do so at soltrader.net\n\nWhy I did it\n\nSlow frames: When working with Ruby, I use the excellent Gosu library to do all my game specific coding. This initially worked great, but occasionally I'd just get slow frames coming up. My game is timed to run at 60 frames per second, which means that each frame should take no more than 16.67ms to run. Yet every so often my profiling would come up with a frame that would take 25ms or 45ms for no discernible reason. I just couldn't find the issue here: I turned every sub system in the game off. I disabled garbage collection. I hacked my slow frame detection code into the simplest gosu sample I could find, and they still existed. I didn't feel like I could quite trust the stack to deliver the framerate I needed, and I hadn't yet put in half the features I wanted to.\n\nObject explosion when bridging to C: A lot of the libraries I was using were written in C, and therefore there was several thousand objects (mostly floats) being created each frame to act as a bridge between Ruby and C code. It feels like that that CPU time should be better spent in the AI improving the quality of the simulation, or on better effects, rather than loading the garbage collection with an unnecessary burden.\n\nEase of packaging and distribution: I feel like packaging is going to be a lot easier. I'm not too bothered about hiding the source code: I may well do that anyway to purchasers of the game. It's the running on Windows I'm worried about: from my research it feels like it's going to take some effort to push the game out on a non-Unix platform. And with a video game, releasing on Windows is a must.\n\nManual memory management for performance: The garbage collection is still too stuttery under MRI (even with Ruby 1.9.3, which is a huge improvement on what's gone before) - it still stops the world each time. I looked at other implementations, and even considered learning all about garbage collection to help improve Ruby myself, but then realised that getting royally distracted wouldn't help me ship a working game.\n\nWhat do I miss about Ruby?\n\nI miss using RSpec hugely: There are ways of doing testing of C programs using RSpec but it doesn't feel like I want to wrap each of my C++ classes with a SWIG interface just to check they're working. I may still do this for some form of Cucumber testing, I'm not sure. I'm using UnitTest++ for my testing at the moment, which is very lightweight and good enough for my purposes.\n\nDuck-typing: defining interfaces for everything is a pain in the backside, although it does force you to think more clearly about the roles of your classes.\n\nEasy mockist testing: There's no built in reflection in C++ so it also makes you have to code to interfaces if you want to do any mockist testing. I'm mostly returning to a classist style of testing with small well defined groups of classes being tested at once. It's not a perfect system and I still have much learning to do here.\n\nTerseness of syntax: There's just a lot more characters to type, and a lot more ceremony for each class. This tempts you to larger classes and methods, which I'm resisting at the moment. I need to take the time to set up c.vim exactly how I want it.\n\nFunnily enough, I don't miss the automatic memory management: I like having that level of control. Old habits die hard.\n\nSo how far have I got?\n\nThankfully, it's not a complete rewrite as I'd already done a lot of thinking about the architecture and a lot of the basic classes translate directly over. I worked really hard at the end of last week and got a lot done:\n\nI put in SDL to build the basic game framework: hopefully building on Windows will be a snap. I plan to have a working Windows build as soon as I can lay my hands on a cheap Windows 7 PC.\n\nBasic testing using UnitTest++, with tests that are compiled and run as part of the build process.\n\nDecoupled gameplay/physics updates from the graphical framerate using the techniques here. I have zero temporal aliasing bugs right now, which makes for a super smooth 300+ FPS graphic loop with a fixed 60FPS physics loop.\n\nRe-imple", "eta_suffix": "'s a mistake.\n\nInstead, try closing the application, accepting a lower fee, or demonstrating your ability to pay your balance quickly.
