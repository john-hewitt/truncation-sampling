{"eta": "The Wolf currently has the former Seminole as his RB33, but expect Dalvin Cook to get a gigantic bump in the rankings after taking advantage of Latavius Murray's recent absences. This isn't a bad matchup for RBs, but Cook is incredibly superior in every facet of the game. The offensive line won't make things easy for Cook, but Fournette should be the focal point of the offense now that O.J. Howard is out. Fournette is a tough matchup for any back to keep under 50 yards, but Dalvin Cook (2018 draft pick) can have some nice monster performances in this offense.\n\nMarcus Davenport (CB40, DEN) @ Miami (FL)* \u2014 OWNed in 38 percent of Yahoo leagues\n\nCarson Wentz\n\nThe Broncos have the worst secondary in football but not the best offensive line of their own. Carson Wentz will be pressured a lot, which will make it challenging for him to throw on the run for the most part. While Jarryd Hayne (2018 draft pick) is an upgrade at RB for the Broncos, he doesn't run well enough to benefit from running in multiple schemes in Denver. With this in mind, I expect Jared Goff to keep up this pace while playing in a system that is tougher on passing downs. Running behind a strong line is good with Ben Roethlisberger playing better under pressure in a league that is loaded with shots at scoring. A closer look at the matchup might give Jared Fizz all you really need to move this line up in the first half if you are among the groups that keep him there.\n\nJeremy Hill (RB60, HOU) @ Cleveland (CLE) \u2014 OWNed in 21 percent of Yahoo leagues\n\nBen Tate\n\nThe Dolphins have a very difficult matchup on paper this week against an impressive Bengals secondary, but it appears they have surrendered more yards to opposing RBs than they have to opposing RBs.\n\nView Profile Todd Gurley MIN \u2022 RB \u2022 23 Week 1 stats vs. CIN FPTS 8.2\n\nDo not sleep on Todd Gurley; he has a great matchup against a bad Bengals secondary and a fantasy defense that allows the fewest fantasy points to all RBs.\n\nLeGarrette Blount (RB37, NYJ) @ Tennessee (TB) \u2014 OWNed in 9 percent of Yahoo leagues\n\nMarvin Kamara\n\nThis should be a good game for running backs because it is the league's cheapest game, and there is a new law in Tennessee encouraging teams to use lead blockers by allowing a team to run the ball without having to use a RB/WR split. Running back matchups are never a strong sign; if those are good, you are in trouble, but running back matchups usually fall to the bottom of the pile in the near term. This will be a great matchup for Blount in New England's tough pass defense because the Patriots are already giving up a lot of points to opposing RBs, but the Patriots' offense has been throwing the ball well behind Brandon Bolden (2018 draft pick) since Kamara came in, so the Titans can make it difficult on Blount. Look for the Titans to try to limit him in the ground game, but expect him to have some good success in the air. For Ty, this is an opportunity to pound the rock over Devontae Booker (2017 pick) and fake the defense to use Kamara and Blount extensively.\n\nJosh Jacobs (RB30, TEN) vs. Philadelphia (PHI) \u2014 Owned in 16 percent of Yahoo leagues\n\nRobert Woods\n\nThe Eagles are having an interesting week without Jeremy Maclin, and in general, it has been tough to use their WR3 to open up a lead. The Patriots have been most successful running outside on teams with great pressure, though the Broncos also have one of the best defenses in the game against pass-heavy teams. Rob Gronkowski (2018 draft pick) might end up being limited again this week, although the Pats have been generally good against the run when he has been out. You should be running plenty of passing plays after Maclin goes, but even if you do the Eagles run defense isn't especially tough. With Will Tye potentially out, it is more likely that Tyrell Williams or James White (2018), either of which is better than Josh Doctson (2018) for this game.\n\nTre Mason (RB46, WAS) vs. Atlanta (ATL) \u2014 OWNed in 14 percent of Yahoo leagues\n\nDez Bryant\n\nWhile the Falcons aren't allowing more yards per game than everyone, Dez Bryant is an NFL player this week. He is always a great matchup and when he takes over the Falcons offense and decides to run, he is great. The Falcons rank very low on plays of 20-plus yards, and Dez is not currently above 18 when you separate out passing and rushing attempts. The good matchup makes running him more appealing than playing him on", "topp": "The Wolf currently has the former Seminole as his RB33, but expect Dalvin Cook to get a gigantic bump in the rankings after taking advantage of Latavius Murray's opportunities this past weekend.\n\nNote: All 2018 NFL mock draft charts are now updated. While I'm not active on Twitter (and you should probably be), I tweet out game results, Twitter snatches, TV ratings, college breakdowns, and my prospects, draft day strategy, stuff, and so on. Follow me @walterfootball for updates.\n\n1. Todd Gurley, RB, Georgia\n\nTodd Gurley is already being mentioned as a possible GPP play this week. After a disappointing outing against Alabama, Gurley had 35 touches in the last two games after dealing with an injury. He has averaged 13 yards on those drives and right now ranks third in the SEC in rush yards. With another half-dozen catches, the freshman is a legitimate concern to owners that want to risk the week's turnover potential.\n\n2. Josh Allen, QB, Wyoming\n\nAllen's six TDs are a career high (2nd half). He's connected on 37% of his passes this season and has averaged 17 attempts. Through two games he's thrown for 475 yards. The offensive line has been decent (at least until last week) with only one sack allowed. He's a sneaky WR2 for Sundays.\n\n3. Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford\n\nMyles Gaskin and Pharoah McKever are the duo that I'm most focused on heading into the NFL Draft. I see McCaffrey as the superior option though with Brock Osweiler's salary and which offense he plays in this season. Speaking of, Carson Palmer, Eddie Royal, and Jay Cutler are all untouchable QBs heading into week 3. Running back Kaelin Clay will also be a legitimate flex option and provides an added element of risk.\n\n4. JuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, USC\n\nHad a fantastic performance at the Shrine Game, sparking his draft stock for days. Still working on his progression away from Kyle Shanahan, McAdoo has his new WR1 under center. While there is just one effort, Kendall Wright could sit around all season as a package play. Smith-Schuster is a dart throw QB2 who should rack up a lot of WR3 totals.\n\n5. Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State\n\nHad a monster performance against Alabama in week 2, serving as the target for the running game in the run game's run by all means. Carried the ball 22 times for 248 yards and 3 TDs. Another dynamic week, especially with Jerick McKinnon slowly recovering from ACL damage.\n\n6. Samaje Perine, RB, Oklahoma\n\nPerine carried the ball three times for a meager 18 yards. He is a RB2 who could see a true RB3 total through the air if he takes advantage of Melvin Gordon's (heck, Percy Harvin's) injured absence. Not owned in the most expensive leagues, he's worth the risk with a solid floor going forward.\n\n7. Jeff Driskel, QB, TCU\n\nDriskel's first two starts were a bit iffy, but he has looked flatter-legged and more comfortable with more chances to throw lately. The FBS ranks third in touchdowns. Throw a long TD pass to Trevorris Johnson and that's a legit target for you. Then notching a couple of short throws and an efficient performance on Sunday against Indiana will be a nice step in the right direction.\n\n8. Eddie Jackson, WR, Auburn\n\nFor much of the season, Jackson had back-to-back two-game stretches that would've had him falling out of draft discussions. With this one, his INT. and the addition of four receptions on Sunday, he might actually take advantage of the favorable matchup. An injury to Chad Kelly could potentially make this a must-own WR2 heading into week three.\n\n9. Maty Mauk, TE, BYU\n\nMauk had his first bounce-back performance of the season last weekend and is one of the top Fantasy points producers in the game right now, so grab him before he gets rolling again. He's completed over 50% of his passes and is averaging 11.5 YPR. Updating his schedule as he travels to UTEP next week gives him a floor of 55% passing but a ceiling of 87% as the Hoosiers await their powerful defensive backfield.\n\n10. Brandin Cooks, WR, Oregon State\n\nCooks has been getting more involved in the passing game in the first two weeks, but he remains a WR3/flex with the upside to be a committee threat. That being said, more touchdown upside remains to be tested, with Matthew Stafford likely to have plenty of favorable matchups on Sunday.\n\n11. Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State\n\nCook", "human": "The Wolf currently has the former Seminole as his RB33, but expect Dalvin Cook to get a gigantic bump in the rankings after taking advantage of Latavius Murray's absence during the first week of training camp. Cook is catching the eye of his teammates and coaches, and currently possesses workhorse potential in Minnesota.\n\nA succession of poor decisions off the field, ball security issues on the field and a mediocre combine dropped the uber-talented Dalvin Cook all the way to pick No. 41 to the Minnesota Vikings \u2014 who let Vikings legend and seven-time All-Pro Adrian Peterson walk in free agency, while adding goal line hammer Latavius Murray in March.\n\nAfter Christian McCaffrey came off the board, us at the Roto Street Journal were pleading for a team like the Bucs, Raiders or Packers to select Cook. Once the Vikings drafted Cook, the fantasy community broke out in a cold sweat. Minnesota does very little to help out their running backs: from their porous offensive line, to their up-and-down passing situation and blah-scheme, it's tough to be a running back for the purple and gold.\n\nThe Wolf was especially hurt by this combination, stating:\n\nCook landed in arguably the worst spot possible with Minnesota. Indeed, the talent is there, but that's about all he has working in his favor. The team dished out oodles of money for Latavius Murray, who will undoubtedly be involved, especially near the stripe. Additionally, the line is among the worst in football, and there's little else really threatening defenses or creating TD opportunities. Throw in a bland, vanilla scheme, and Cook will be relying on his own high-end abilities to produce any fantasy value in 2017.\n\nAlthough Murray had the highest percentage of carries inside the 5-yard line last season (81.8 percent in Oakland), we didn't take the severity of his ankle injury into account before grading out Cook's situation. The reason why Murray took multiple free agent visits was to prove to teams in person that the bone spurs in his ankle were not serious, and the Vikings took the bait. The former Raider underwent surgery on his ankle a week after signing and was expected to be ready for the start of training camp.\n\nFast forward to the start of training camp, and Latavius Murray is still MIA. In fact, on July 31st, Murray put no timetable on his return and would only commit to the regular season. After missing the entire offseason program and the start of camp with his new team, a frustrated Murray stated that he's \"behind the 8-ball.\" He went onto say, \"if I'm not healthy, there's no point in me being out there. If I'm not good out there, I can't help the team regardless.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the rookie running back is taking full advantage of his opportunity by taking the majority of the first team reps and he's caught the attention of his teammates and coaches.\n\n\"The first thing the veteran players I've talked to about him say is, 'This guy gets it.'\" coach Mike Zimmer explained after a practice. \"He understands protections, he works hard, they see how he interacts in the locker room, and that's part of it. And then, when you have a special player\u2014like when we got [linebacker Anthony] Barr\u2014they say, 'Hey, man, this guy is different than other guys.' \"That's kinda how he is. They see him out there on the field with the other guys, and it's like, 'There's something different about this guy, the way he runs, accelerates, the creases he can get to.' He's got a tough mentality. Players can see exceptional athletes. When they go out there and they're going against guys, they can see: This guy is pretty good.\"\n\nAs one can see, it's safe to say that Dalvin Cook has earned the staff's trust, and with Murray still sidelined, he's truly entering a workhorse role. The cause for concern is still there, as he has a tendency to fumble, and once Murray joins the team, he's likely to vulture 7-10 touchdowns from the 5-foot-10, 210 lb rookie. The offensive line still sucks and the scheme is still as vanilla as can be, but with his elite pass catching skills, he could definitely see 250-plus touches. In fact, Vikings beat writer Matt Vensel of the Star Tribune said, \"don't rule out\" 300 touches for the rookie.\n\nCook will bring big-play ability (10 50-plus yard runs at Florida State), elite hands for a runner (79 receptions in three seasons) and every-down potential (766 touches in three seasons) to a Vikings team that desperately needs a legitimate playmaker.

{"eta": "The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its failing strategy against ISIS\u2014and rightly so. But amid all the scorn, one question has yet to be asked about the entire effort: Why is the U.S. essentially just supporting a disintegrating state?\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has launched 13\n\ncoalition strikes in Iraq and Syria this year against ISIS\u2014and at least 22 have occurred since August\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition is dropping bombs based in Iraq and Syria on the Islamic State, but the campaign is geared toward toppling the organization rather than capturing it. And as ISIS is taking control of swathes of territory and applying violence across Iraq and Syria, the U.S. has mostly appeared to drop bombs and send aid to the fledgling local affiliate of the caliphate.\n\nAs long as that's the case, many are confused about why there is U.S. intervention in this country at all, let alone on such an intensive scale. The Iraq-Syria campaign is a testament, and the only question is whether the U.S. is now, finally, fighting a successful war on terror and the threat that it represents.\n\nFor the first seven months of the battle in Iraq and Syria, the U.S. has waged a \"too little too late\" war. This was the finding of a coalition of organizations launched by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates last April. In a document released during a congressional hearing on Saturday, officials of the Syrian Civil Defense, the U.K.-based organization that conducts evacuations for people near ISIS-held Raqqa, Iraq, blamed the U.S.-led coalition for failing to deliver more than a \"six-month wait\" to meet the August deadline for air drops from coalition planes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We have been frustrated this year with the coalition's commitment to actually do the ground part of the operation,\" Syrian Civil Defense co-founder Mariam Al-Husseini told National Public Radio. \"[Our] primary objective as responders to what's going on there is now to try to provide them as much as we possibly can.\"\n\nAl-Husseini claims the evacuations are not giving sufficient support \"because of the low quality of our communications.\" She's also concerned by the lack of access to the bombed sites. \"Even with the most sophisticated communications, which our organization can provide, our systems only really have access into the crater where the coalition are dropping the bombs,\" Al-Husseini said.\n\nAfter the indiscriminate strikes in Syria and Iraq claimed over 200 Syrian and Iraqi civilians, and the loss of over 43 members of the U.S.-led coalition, the Obama administration has been criticized for its inaction. There is concern, also, over the lack of discipline shown by U.S. military operations. \"When you start to see the American people lack a sense of leadership, when they have more doubts than before about their own government's military readiness, and when they begin to see that the Syrian Democratic Forces appear to be more about gung-ho conquest than about reaching out to communities and those working to defend the people of Raqqa,\" says retired Lt. Gen. Charles Cleveland, who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in a similar capacity in Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Obama administration didn't respond to VICE News for this article. But former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta defended the campaign against ISIS as a reasonable response to the Sunni insurgency that had been escalating in Iraq in the years prior. \"You have groups inside and outside of Iraq that are violent and jihadist fighters, and you're playing this war,\" he told the Christian Science Monitor in September. But he conceded that the government also struggled to block financing from sources like the Islamic State's leadership: \"So that is where we have to go from there. These are very difficult decisions the White House faces and that's why I believe that is a focus of the mission that we're taking.\"\n\nWhile the Obama administration has been criticized for its jingoistic criticism of the ongoing conflicts on the ground in Syria, Iraq and Libya\u2014elevating them to wars\u2014those same commentators have often given other explanations of the U.S.'s lack of involvement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a MSNBC interview on Sunday, James Sully of the New York Times said that, \"Budgets and commitments can be to blame\" for the ongoing Obama administration's struggles in the Middle East.\n\nEchoing comments made last month by President Obama on the campaign trail, Brian Beutler of The Atlantic wrote that if only the United States had taken on ISIS \"at the beginning of the [Iraq-Syria] war, we would be able to stop this kind of thing, these deaths, and today we are rushing to a war where the problem is bigger, deadlier, and more complicated than it needs to be. We can't be so negligent.\"\n\nAmid all the chyrons, scrutiny and anger from", "topp": "The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its failing strategy against ISIS\u2014and rightly so. But amid all the scorn, one question has yet to be asked about the entire Middle East: How can ISIS be defeated and eventually taken out in any reasonable, sustainable fashion?\n\n(It's worth pointing out that ISIS isn't a matter of Islamic doctrine that can be unraveled through an hours-long conversations with a jihadist scholar. It is not alone: At almost any time of the day, Al Qaeda is involved in massive atrocities and inspiring terrorist attacks of a dangerous variety in several countries.)\n\nWhen asked at a recent hearing of Congress about whether or not the United States would defend any allies in the region should a counter attack fail, Ashton shrugged off the question: \"We will do what we can to defend the people and countries that we partner with.\" Although this may not be news, it's a profoundly unusual State Department answer for a member of President Obama's cabinet. If it were any other President, chances are that Ashton would be in some way revealing the U.S. military's thinking behind the mission of that \"partner\" nation, but this particular golem also happens to be the head of the State Department.\n\n\"The U.S. military is now engaged in a conflict with an organization that has been alive for years and intends to persist through global instability and U.S. economic sanctions,\" wrote Charles Lister at Foreign Policy. \"Its ability to extend oversold aspirations and carry them into the battlefield is itself an anomaly in today's ruthless world.\"\n\nSo how does the Obama administration keep watching ISIS with a beak and a wing? For starters, it should be noted that the United States is still fairly relaxed about the latest U.S. failures. When struck, the Turks had extra time to withdraw their troops and to reestablish control in Syria as a result of an unfavorable flight of American fighter planes to base.\n\nWhen asked by Ann Coulter on a radio program about the rather steady announcement that an ISIS \"corridor\" had been cut through Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry said \"nothing's changed yet.\" Despite having the leverage to force Turkey to withdraw, this indicates to me that the U.S. has no plan to pressure the Turkish government to find a way to deal with ISIS. It's become a bit of a commonplace among the Democratic Party to be opposed to President Obama because he has not been highly effective in his efforts to deal with the Islamic militants.\n\nThink about it\u2014if America is taking out ISIS, why the hell does the administration want to throw fuel on the fires? These know-nothings like to talk a good game, but this isn't any American policy\u2014nor is it Middle Eastern policy. Whatever the administration and its cohorts in the House and Senate come up with to defeat ISIS, it's not gonna solve a damn thing.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton is fine going on about being \"tough\" and having more smoke than mirrors but he is manifestly not taking up an enormous amount of space on the Long War Journal. If the strikes are going to be effective, the emphasis on Isis must be swift and devastating, because it's an organization that is evolving to target the United States. As the author of the play Intolerable Cruelty, Hans Karel Mully, once explained in this very insightful article:\n\n\"If what the White House seems to want in order to achieve its objective\u2014refusing to limit the spectacular and often terroristic actions and fisticuffs toward the United States, showing that Europe is being misused as a venue and a \"safe-haven\" for terrorist acts against the West\u2014is also the aim of the attacks, then the triumph of the White House's troops on the ground, according to this account, will be unparalleled. It won't at all fool the people in Brussels, all due respect.\"\n\nIt's a no brainer that stealth bombing on ISIS will never change the Islamic State's strategy. Do we really want to wake up one day and find that our aircraft have been used to stifle insurgencies to overthrow governments with NATO backing? ISIS will always be using unconventional tactics in a futile attempt to establish an international caliphate that is invisible to its enemies; but to deny that and the U.S. air campaign is the worst thing the U.S. can do is utterly false. It will also force the enemy to react from their own line of territory, thus allowing other great powers to exploit it and its resources.\n\nCivilian deaths are part and parcel of the tribal revolution against the evil West. It's much more stressful to live in enemy territory in the vast desert of Syria than the petty, abbreviated civil war in Europe or even the international civil war that preceded it.

The photographers who have visited the king's", "human": "The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its failing strategy against ISIS\u2014and rightly so. But amid all the scorn, one question has yet to be asked about the resiliency of the terror army, which actually goes to the heart of its decade-old war doctrine. Namely: Does ISIS actually win even when it loses?\n\nThis isn't an academic issue. America's allies in the ISIS war are gearing up for a major counteroffensive against the extremist group. That assault that could very well play right into ISIS's hands.\n\nHaving superimposed its self-styled \"caliphate\" over a good third of Iraq's territory, in control of two provincial capitals, ISIS is today in the strongest position it has ever been for fomenting the kind of sectarian conflagration its founding father, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, envisioned as far back as 2004.\n\nZarqawi's end-game was simple: by waging merciless atrocities against Iraq's Shia majority population (and any Sunnis seen to be conspiring with it), Zarqawi's jihadists would have only to stand back and watch as radicalized Shia militias, many of whose members also served in various Iraqi government and security roles, conducted their own retaliatory campaigns against the country's Sunni minority. Internecine conflict would have the knock-on effect of driving Sunnis desperately into the jihadist fold, whether or not they sympathized with the ideology of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Zarqawi's franchise and the earliest incarnation of what we now call the Islamic State.\n\nIndeed, in the mid-2000s, the Jordanian jihadist nearly got what he wished for by waging spectacular terror attacks against Shia civilians and holy sites, such as the Golden Mosque in Samarra, a strategy which quickened devolved Iraq's violence from a primarily anti-American insurgency into all-out civil war. The only stopgap for a truly apocalyptic or nation-destroying result was the presence of nearly 200,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Today, however, absent such a foreign and independent military presence, the main actors left in Iraq are the same extremists\u2014Shia militias and ISIS.\n\nThis fact was only driven home last week after thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi Security Force personnel, including the elite counterterrorist Golden Division, fled from Ramadi, allowing the city fall to a numerically modest contingent of ISIS jihadists. Having been initially instructed by Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to refrain from defending the city (no doubt at the prompting of Washington) the Hashd al-Shaabi, the umbrella organization for these Shia militias, now say they are prepping a massive counteroffensive to retake Ramadi. It promises to be a drawn-out and highly fraught counteroffensive, pitting paramilitaries\u2014which have been accused of war crimes and atrocities by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2014against genocidal ISIS militants.\n\nMany Iraqis fear, with good reason, that this counteroffensive will also extend to Sunni civilians who will now be branded \"collaborators\" of ISIS, as they have in previous Hashd-led operations. The result: torture, extrajudicial killing, and ethnic cleansing. Nothing would better serve the ISIS narrative or legitimate its claim to be the last custodian and safeguard of Sunni Muslims in the Middle East. Such an outcome might even precede the eventual disintegration of the modern state of Iraq into warring ethno-religious enclaves. That this was ISIS's plan all along adds yet another grim paragraph to the obituary of American-hatched adventurism in the Middle East.\n\nTrue, Hashd al-Shaabi has routed ISIS elsewhere before, namely in Amerli and Jurf al-Sakhar and Tikrit. In the aftermath, the militia was accused of committing human rights abuses, but those accusations didn't tear the country apart.\n\nThe difference with Ramadi, however, is one of both scale and symbolism. This city of close to 200,000 is dead center in the Sunni heartland of Iraq, where ISIS has the home advantage. Ramadi was also, not coincidentally, the cynosure of the so-called \"Anbar Awakening,\" which saw hundreds of thousands of Sunni tribesmen rise up against ISIS's predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq, in a cautious but fruitful partnership with American soldiers in the mid-2000s, a grassroots counterinsurgency whose gains were then solidified by the \"surge\" orchestrated by U.S. commander General David Petraeus. This time, absent any American combat forces, there are Shia Islamists who have never before tread into Ramadi. Many Iraqis dread the consequences.\n\n\"Iraq is not unified,\" Iraq's former Deputy Prime Minister Rafe Essawi, a senior Sunni political leader originally from Anbar, told The Daily Beast. \"Fifty percent of the country belongs either to Kurds or ISIS, and 50 percent belongs", "eta_suffix": " beginning of the [Iraq-Syria] war, we would be able to stop this kind of thing, these deaths, and today we are rushing to a war where the problem is bigger, deadlier, and more complicated than it needs to be.

In Tokyo, Soka Gakkai members thought that its foreign priests were excessively focused on themselves and had totally lost their way.\" (Nihon Nihon K\u014dkai 2001)\n\n1943\u201344 \u2013 Shioda Shingo, head of the Japan Soka Gakkai and first male to die during the Soka Gakkai's Shinto rituals, become the first Japanese to be ordained as a priest, and his ordination was now officially a formal Soka Gakkai matter.\n\n1975\n\nSince 1975, Soka Gakkai priests have not ordained anyone as a priest, and several temples have stopped ordaining priests for lack of a place to teach.\n\n\n1981\u201385 \u2013 Following the suppression of the Soka Gakkai by the Government of Japan, some of the most prominent members of Soka Gakkai lost their homes and livelihoods due to forced deportation. This was partly a reaction against the Soka Gakkai's unique and unusual teaching doctrine and strategies on collectivism.\n\n1986\u201387 \u2013 Soka Gakkai being put into a harsh condition by the Soka Gakkai, dozens of senior priests of the Soka Gakkai were arrested and investigated for organizing illegal activities. By 1988 the Soka Gakkai was deprived of most of its basic institutional financial resources.\n\n1997\n\n\n\"A new Soka Gakkai effort was not allowed into the northern Japan port of Sakebataikan until 2000. While Soka Gakkai members did make the pilgrimage to the port in the previous century in special times of prayer, Soka Gakkai preachers and temple members then spent time and money in order to ensure the approval and inclusion of the new Soka Gakkai. \"Urania Christians\", a group of Soka Gakkai members who never left their Soka Gakkai homes during the course of their lives, took to the border land and passed around brochures and printed material in English, inviting people to the Soka Gakkai with one intention \u2013 to force upon the Soka Gakkai members of the southern island of Hokkaido that the time for their re-entry", "topp": "Major events in the history of SGI and Priesthood\n\n\n1941\n\n\nDivision between Soka Kyoiku Gakkai and the priesthood surfaced because of the Soka Gakkai's ostracism from the priesthood as well as the exclusion of some members from non-Soka Gakkai gatherings. The priesthood came to the forefront of the ultimate of many disputations within the SGI, a case within which it and Soka Kyoiku Gakkai were able to resolve their differences. The priesthood was ultimately granted all rights in the priesthood (along with those rights of directorship to senior leaders), but it reserved the right to represent the priesthood to various associations and congregations.\n\n\n1946\n\n\nAfter the Soka Gakkai introduced a period of consultation on matters of principal importance to the priesthood, in which the SGI even initiated the creation of a Moriwaki service group, it slowly became clear that there was little priority to the priesthood as it existed under the leadership of the national leadership. The Soka Gakkai ceased affiliation with the priesthood in 1948 and formally severed the priesthood affiliation in 1951. In 1953, the Regional Council was established to lead all temples. The newest member of the Soka Gakkai, Uehara Kyouri, was subsequently ordained as a priest. Uehara's writing on the priesthood also led him to begin studying the priesthood as the priesthood, of its own accord. He became responsible for publishing a special volume called Riso Kyoiku Ryoku (The New Priesthood).\n\n\n1967\n\n\nA constitution was adopted in which the Venerable Ansei Shisankai, the Venerable Kotaro Gamagoori, the Venerable Haibara Toda, and the Venerable Daisaku Ikeda became national leaders. These priests were chosen after prayer meetings of unapologetic Orthodoxy within the general membership were held. Unanimity in the book motivated a majority to adopt the book. With 461 municipal ordinances passed, six national central authorities were set up, and five temples were built; and 100 community bodies and 44 authorized divisions were founded. A more than 60-year historical interruption since the loss of the priesthood had now been consolidated into a period during which it was approved, approved of, and sanctioned.\n\n\n1972\n\n\nThe Soka Gakkai established the first two Soka University colleges in Japan, Ando-ni and Fukuoka, with Ph.D. degrees in Divinity studies. Finally, the salary and support of the priests' families were increased and they were offered transportation and hospitality, especially for military service, as well as for humanitarian and charitable activities.\n\n\nSoka Gakkai moved forward on a plan to compete with the U.S. church in helping cities organize \"free schools\" through the international Soka Gakkai's International Council or IGIC. These schools were merged into a single school with special subsidies. The second annual \"Peace Conference\" was set up. The IGIC placed 13,000 school volunteers into colleges and universities across the world, distributed 113,000 Yama Kogen albums, and formed a total of 2,586 pupils. According to a preliminary report, 6,127 pupils were further educated, including one-quarter in the U.S., and an additional 496 received something called the European Peace School. On October 15, 1972, this double-highest satisfaction survey was completed, indicating that 25 out of 38 military units within the government were organized through the IGIC, and 72 out of 200 police units and 121 fire units had taken up this additional role.\n\n\n1976\n\n\nThe Venerable Daisaku Ikeda devoted three days to home schooling at Soka University's Matto Institute in Nagasaki, and about 1,000 registered students attended those sessions. Student participation at Soka University activities has continued, but it has not been held at the depth of commitment this time.\n\n1980\n\n\nGakkai International, established in 1980, announced a program of single-person missionary work for the conversion of 15,000 young people worldwide, a fourfold increase over its first five-year period. Gakkai affiliated prisons, orphanages, and school-based organizations were chosen from surrounding municipalities as base camps for plans that came to fruition in 1981 and 1982. Individual Kyoiku Gakkai-linked \"houses of God\" were established in 24 inner cities throughout Japan, all of which had been especially vilified for their means of self-sufficiency in the Soka Gakkai. Other Gakkai schools collaborated with local government institutions to revive and modernize a section of the criminal justice system for delinquent minors. Three separate chapters, each with a base camp of special stations and amenities, expanded their intended guest programs: friendship, English language instruction, and missionary scholarships for CCC members in Nigeria.\n\n1988\n\n\nSoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, surprised by the growth of this increasingly concentrated following, picked up", "human": "Major events in the history of SGI and Priesthood\n\n\n1941\n\n\nDivision between Soka Kyoiku Gakkai and the priesthood surfaced because of the priesthood's obedience to the authorities' demands during the II World War to regard the Emperor as superior to the Buddha.\n\n\n1952\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the second president, Mr Toda was banned in 1952 from entering the Head Temple, because of Soka Gakkai's youth demand of an apology from a priest who cooperated with the military authorities.\n\n\nToda wrote: \"I thought I'd receive a reward for my loyalty in rebuking slander of the Law, but instead of praise, they handed me a reproof: 'You're banned from visiting the head temple!' My disciples replied in unison, 'Then we won't visit either, so there!'\" People are Sovereign\n\n\n1979\n\n\nThe priesthood banned P. Ikeda from giving guidance, demanded his resignation from presidency, and demanded absolute obedience of the organisation to the priesthood. P.Ikeda turned that setback into a victory through focusing on world wide movement and strengthening SGI.\n\n\nDespite the pressure and harassment, lay believers never stopped assisting the Head Temple, donating land, buildings and branch temples: \" \u2026the Soka Gakkai built a total of 356 temples, of which 320 were built while I was president. Also, over the years, we conducted countless group pilgrimages to the head temple \u2013 the aggregate attendance coming to more than 70 million\".\n\n\nPeople are Sovereign\n\n\n1980-s\n\n\nMany members were questioning the conduct and the expensive life style of some priests (using members donations), Ordinary members raised their complaints about local priests excessive demands for conducting spiritual services, such as at marriages or prayers for the deceased (and which required considerable donations).\n\n\nTogether with the monopoly on issuing Gohonzon, the priesthood objected to considering lay believers as one of the Three Treasures (being: the Buddha, the Law and Samgha or the Community of Practitioners), asserting that the Treasure of Community is that of the Priests-only. Another matter of disagreement was the concept of Heritage of the Law, with the priesthood asserting that the heritage belongs only to one person (the High Priest), excluding laity.\n\n\n1990\n\n\n\"Then, in December, as 1990 was rapidly drawing to a close, the priesthood suddenly sent the Soka Gakkai with a letter of inquiry. It contained a list of the most ridiculous charges \u2013 such as the accusation that singing Beethoven's great hymn to universal human freedom, 'Ode to Joy', constitutes 'praise for non-Buddhist teachings'.\n\n\nFurthermore, the priesthood demanded a response to their charges within seven days\". People are Sovereign\n\n\nSGI request for dialogue with the priesthood was rejected by the Head Temple - assuming that lay believers will leave SGI organisation and register in temples. Members, however, submitted a petition asking for the resignation of the High Priest. Finally, the SGI was excommunicated from the Head Temple (28 November 1991), a date recognised by SGI as the day of spiritual independence of ordinary people.\n\n\n\"We must ensure that the common people are eternally free from domination by evil tyrants. The people are the base upon which all things rest, the most important factor. A power that does not rely on authorities, that is unswayed by them, is to be found in the power of humanity, of unity and of democracy. We must never allow this power to be diminished. This is the profound significance of the Buddhism of human revolution, which stimulates and nurtures this human power to the highest degree.\"\n\n\nSGI Newsletter 5821, 5826 (Dec. 2003)\n\n\n1992\n\n\nSeveral temples refused to follow the High Priest and disassociated themselves from the Head Temple (Association of Reformist Priests), giving their support to SGI. One of the basic issues between the Priesthood and the Association of Reformist Priests is the demand for the Head Temple's apology for supporting the war and for altering Nichiren's letters.\n\n\n2000\n\n\nThe Priesthood completes destruction of its Head Temple, the Shohondo building, which was donated by the Soka Gakkai.\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\nBack to: Nichiren Shoshu & S G I\n\n\nHomepage", "eta_suffix": " left their Soka Gakkai homes during the course of their lives, took to the border land and passed around brochures and printed material in English, inviting people to the Soka Gakkai with one intention \u2013 to force upon the Soka Gakkai members of the southern island of Hokkaido that the time for their re-entry", "topp_suffix": " of the criminal justice system for delinquent minors.

Richardson was in North Korea on a mission to sell New Mexico tourism companies on the country.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nNorth Korea released a tourist as a part of a prisoner swap with the United States for the kidnapped U.S. college student. North Korea said it had given him back and was prepared to release him, but the United States says it won't. They say Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, was wrongfully imprisoned. In the meantime, there's continued conflict between the nations, as they trade insults, and comments, and threats, and has Otto Warmbier that baby gone too soon. We're speaking with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson. Governor Richardson worked as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton. Here in the state of New Mexico, he's the senior state Senator from north of Albuquerque and sits as chairman of the Transportation Committee. Governor Richardson, a brief introduction for you, courtesy of the El Paso Times. Governor Richardson?\n\nBILL RICHARDSON: Hi, Kelly.\n\nMCEVERS: I think they could be on a diet if you're there for long.\n\nRICHARDSON: I know. I did something similar to you.\n\nMCEVERS: Yeah, yeah.\n\nRICHARDSON: As you know, I'm governor of New Mexico, and we've had a little bit of a tough time in the past year, you know, on immigration issues. I think the whole time, we've tried to stay out of this, even though we've had problems with immigration in the state.\n\nMCEVERS: Fair to say, though, things have actually been getting better in recent years in terms of immigration.\n\nRICHARDSON: They're absolutely getting better, Kelly. I'll give you an example - somebody asked me this morning how the governor and the Democratic Party in New Mexico were doing, and I just could tell they were running scared in the primary and the general election. This week alone, I've been in Fort Stockton and had a local high school student from the Bronx saying, sir, we just don't like you one bit.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMCEVERS: Right. So how do you work against that? How do you defuse - what does your approach in that, as mayor?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, as a Democratic governor, I'm very, very active in working with the Hispanic community. I would probably spend 12 years in the state legislature, possibly longer - I don't think you could do that again. I'm going to be one of the first leaders in the state to actually do a full interview with the local bar association at a public event in New Mexico. I know, I know, this is a small town, I know, but if I really can take these issues to the city council and say to them, listen, we have the best bar in New Mexico, and we only have room for 1,000. We're going to require a two-day license before we will serve anyone. You see, every time you say this, New Mexico is very generous, and will give us $1 million, $2 million to help get us back on our feet. But, yeah, I know how tough it is out there for immigrant families to get a job, but I know how this work is.\n\nCORNISH: But, Governor Richardson, you also share that, for you, the role of mayor is much narrower than just being the chief executive of your city.\n\nRICHARDSON: Absolutely.\n\nMCEVERS: And that being so narrow?\n\nRICHARDSON: In all likelihood, I'm going to be able to, yes, serve as an effective mayor. I'm going to be the city's chief law enforcement officer for the next two to three years, but I'm going to be able to devote my time and attention to a particular initiative to try to solve the problems that New Mexico has, or else I'm going to leave. But there's no question that I get more of the responsibility than I get the credit for.\n\nCORNISH: One thing that I saw in your, in terms of immigration laws and in terms of this meeting with the bar association, and I think you had a case that can do with some progress today. It was very interesting because you had the bar association meeting with the presidents of the separate correctional facilities - Colorado State, the Fort Stockton prison, to talk about how they were going to deal with the populations of immigrants in prison and to find a solution on that issue.

American Otto Warmbier spent his final days at the U.S. embassy in Pyongyang. Earlier, North Korea welcomed its prisoner. It's Kim Jong Un. We wanted to talk to his former governor, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson. The pair know each other.\n\nYou just spoke to the governor. How are you now?\n\nWILLIAMS: I'm feeling great. I'm living a great life. I'll tell you I'm in complete bliss. I love my country. But I don't love the way the North Koreans are behaving.\n\nMCEVERS: Why?\n\nWILLIAMS: They've done this enough times and you can't behave like that around those kids. They're large families, like these children, maybe 10, 15 of them. They've been through so much for many years.\n\nMCEVERS: So why the tone of the language?\n\nWILLIAMS: No, I'm not sure. We've seen a lot of rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea since the Cold War. But this escalated is different. When you have a long arm of our military right next door to their nuclear weapons testing, of course that plays into this rhetoric.\n\nBut we're talking about the lead-up to an actual explosion. And as the president was coming out early today, he said this could be the beginning of the end of the (laughter) unification of our countries.\n\nMCEVERS: Was it a wish that North Korea might live up to the rhetoric of his administration?\n\nWILLIAMS: It was the best thing he could say.\n\nMCEVERS: Do you think this proves it?\n\nWILLIAMS: I think it proves it at this point. The release came in the morning at this time. North Korea has been very tight-lipped about these kind of happenings.\n\nMCEVERS: So it doesn't really help - it doesn't make it seem likely, isn't that correct?\n\nWILLIAMS: It doesn't really, actually. And it's really the administration's first response. I'm sure Trump has been trying to send a bit of a message. He knows that Otto is the same kind of a person he makes jokes about. But the explanation of his good feeling about Otto, it's a sincere feeling. It's not for political goals. You know? And I think the best the administration can do for Otto is make sure that the United States is that much more tolerant, that we're not putting too much pressure on North Korea to apologize.\n\nMCEVERS: In addition, I have a little piece on another case on the way. We just spoke to a North Korean defector who had been arrested. You understand it's a very tough situation for him. And you said, well, it's his second time out. Why did he do it again?\n\nWILLIAMS: That's a good question. He told us he wanted to get a little freedom back in the face of all his problems, political, religious, media and social issues. And he was able to do that. But the idea of going down there and participating in that kind of abuse, I don't think, is really for him.\n\nMCEVERS: So what happened to him? Why is he doing it again?\n\nWILLIAMS: Not for himself. And he's also upset that the life he could live here was taken away. And he wants to prevent anything like that from happening again.\n\nMCEVERS: Do you think it's really also a message to the Americans who have cooperated with his very repressive government?\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think that sends a pretty clear message about who's really in charge here. It just seems and looks for these type of people to get thrown in jail. And it shows the seriousness of this.\n\nMCEVERS: Terry Willingham is a professor at Catholic University and the author of the book on Otto Warmbier.

A public funeral is planned for Thursday. The 22-year-old died yesterday less than a week after being returned to Ohio from North Korea in a coma. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his condition as a state of unresponsive wakefulness. President Trump talked about Warmbier's death today.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto. That should never ever be allowed to happen. And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different.\n\nMCEVERS: One of the people who had been working to get Warmbier released sooner is former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. His foundation, the Richardson Center, helps negotiate the release of political prisoners. Richardson started working on the case just after Warmbier was detained in January 2016, and he says he had a lot of meetings with North Korean officials.\n\nBILL RICHARDSON: I've talked to him a total myself and my chief of staff 20 times in New York. My executive director, Mickey Bergman, went to North Korea at the end of the year with the support of the Obama administration. We offered private humanitarian aid. North Koreans never responded. They never said yes or no. They never agreed to have me visit as I have in the past - a total mystery but obviously a real cover-up.\n\nMCEVERS: What do you think happened?\n\nRICHARDSON: What I think happened is that the North Koreans engaged in some kind of interrogation, and the interrogation went wrong, that it affected his brain, that he then went into a coma. I don't think they're foolish enough to engage and torture a 21-year-old boy who just stole a political banner. Yeah, he's a bargaining chip, but there's no reason why he might have been tortured.\n\nBut with the North Koreans in the past, you could get prisoners out in exchange for high-level visits, humanitarian assistance. With Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea now, we could make a deal with his father on prisoners, and we've been able to but not with this man. We don't know what he wants. We don't know what makes him tick. Obviously it's something very bad.\n\nMCEVERS: There still are three other American hostages in North Korea. What do we know about them? What does this mean for the efforts to get them released?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, if the North Koreans are smart, they'll let them go as a gesture of contrition and goodwill after this disaster. They were visited by the American diplomat in North Korea when he went to get Otto. I suspect they're in - I won't say good condition, but at least they're there. I think the State Department would have a better feel for how they're doing. But you know, this is Americans held as bargaining chips. There's also a Canadian there that we should be concerned about.\n\nMCEVERS: You know, relationships between the U.S. and North Korea are already basically non-existent. Have you talked to the president about this, and what do you think the U.S.'s options are going forward?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, we have to be sending a very strong message that North Korea needs to have a suitable explanation. Secondly, we need to make sure that there's transparency on their part, maybe a human rights investigation by the U.N. But I wouldn't be opposed to putting more sanctions on North Korea. I don't think the military option makes any sense. I think eventually diplomacy must rule but not for now. I'm very sour and sad and angry right now.\n\nMCEVERS: It's a tough question to ask, but you know, at this time, some people are pointing fingers at one administration or another. Do you think that's useful at this time?\n\nRICHARDSON: It's not useful 'cause I worked with the Obama administration, and they were aware of this. The North Koreans were waiting for the new administration to come in. The Obama people tried. But the election happened, and the North Koreans wanted to probably deal with the Trump administration.

Since it has become a common female trait to \"procreate\", and since there may be another right wing women who like to sleep with younger men while the kids are asleep, you would think women would be to the point they would have the maturity to choose better mates. Well, I have spoken to many women and I would say they have all agreed on this: The only reason we date a single mother is because the old women in our life are still virgins AND the kids are not. I have seen a couple of the and married the old ones and I would say they are the funniest people ever. I do think women feel something after 35 years of matrimony but not quite because they are \"fatter than they were pre-maam.\"\n\nMy sister who had three sons when she got married at 28 was THE sweetest person I ever met, never bought a boyfriend, never asked me to be a partner. She got beat-down in the private sphere yet still wept with joy when we all came together. I've been a member of the LDS Church all my life. My husband married a woman in the Church at just 21. Both my mothers were in the Church at the same time; the two of them were married at 19.\n\nAt twenty-four when my own daughter married her husband, she gave his request for a priesthood blessing the short one-word answer, no. Only to be met with an empty hug from me, followed by him asking to leave for the rest of the week. After years of watching her tear up as I questioned the validity of her decision (she has two other daughters with her husband for god's sake!) I was embarrassed for her, so I told her that she had made a mistake by marrying a man in the Church to begin with. I never spoke with her again.\n\nI am not ashamed of my family, to be the mom, wife, sister, cousin and friend I am. We are unique among American women in that we are not ordered to marry age 35.

I will be 35 in June and my mom told me if I ever wanted to get married, she had it all figured out. (There are a bunch of weird women that we were taught don't want to marry.) I will also tell her my marriage will be over after my sister, then 18, and I am 36. What is most fascinating is that it was all a matter of getting the guidance of church leaders, and having them tell me, repeatedly, that I was a lost cause. And I know my sisters are shocked at my mother's eternal perspective since she was born into a broken home (I thought she was just making you forget about it a couple of decades later).\n\nShe was the cohost and head judge of our first Relief Society (not the LDS equivalent\u2014we didn't need much supervision.) Her name used to be James and then my brother. She married my grandpa and it's been interesting watching us intermingle ever since.\n\nI read some thing that had to do with matrimony and the scriptures in all the people in the world I loved. One thing it said that a woman's worth was measured by her children. It was about what they would call a fairytale wedding, which I can't imagine any brides do. There were 14 marriages done at the time I was born (maybe 5 had children!). My parents weren't not the target audience? If you get married at 19 you already have two children, 2 of whom are 16.\n\nMarriage is actually tough at my age (18) because of my mother. She's a widow at 57, I'm about 54-55 and I'm about to turn 23. What to do?\n\n-What Age?\n\n\nApologies for the V.O.C. and going off on tangents. I loved your question above; it seems to have gotten lost in translation. Your daughter obviously has such a fine sense of humor and she is an amazing personality, but her age makes us look a little crazy. She has so many friends in her church and I almost feel stupid to always try to outdo them when talking about things on the internet.\n\nHonestly, we really do need to stop judging people on their age; what our level of maturity is is important in each individual case.

Half of my friends don't even know their way around Mexico City. Some people are just fuckable and trash-talking is pretty much their theme. But you know what? What woman doesn't want a trash-talker? And they weren't the kind that existed in the '80s.\n\n\nOh, he's dead now, and she wasted a year making you look like the asshole that you are! These men are hard to get. Some go the natural route, a woman will contact you and convince you to hook up or sneak some real flirtation down your pants. Others are REALLY trippy, to the point of getting raped...usually on the way home.\n\n\nWhat do you want? I would ask you for help so you can survive life as a single mother, but I'm sure that would disappoint you.\n\n\nJust don't assume you're single and all the action will happen to you.\n\n\nI believe that for many men, friendships are not things as much a man as a woman is connected to a team. A double life will give you some ideas on how to successfully decide what to do after your own children, but again, I believe that love is something that you build with your own mom.\n\n\nUgh. At the very least, here are some reasons to NEVER date a single mother. I'll leave the specifics of it to you, but here's one person who can't wait.\n\n\nWhy Single Mothers Destroy Family Relationships and Each Other.\n\n\nI mean, I get that your kid is more important to you than your wife, but there are still plenty of socially beneficial things that the father can do for his child (e.g., enroll their kids in/etc. Summer camp, bring their child along to play hockey, etc.). We do what we can to decrease our children's amount of \"stress.\" I don't care if a bitch is going through an abortion. I would prefer not to have to watch her kill it\u2026just like I would prefer not to have to live with a twenty-something man (let alone be related to him.) If you ever are expecting, please think about whether it's in your best interest to hire single mothers. Yes, it's expensive, but it's also the best investment you can make. No mother in her right mind could have a good relationship with the sort of mother you're competing against.\n\n\nNOTE: Most men will argue that they are supportive of children, and the criticism some women often dish them is motivated by their entitlement, but assume they could be better if they had a father in the picture. Most women would probably wince at the thought.\n\n\nWHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? I've been a mother most of my life. A good mother is like a bad domino. Like they become progressively easier as time progresses. Children are one of the few things you cannot destroy. Who you marry affects how prepared you are to raise your children. If you want to have a good life, you need to rely on your husband and not on yourself.\n\n\nWhy Single Mothers Destroy Family Relationships and Each Other.\n\nWill many men try to'save' their children from divorce?\n\n\nThat's right! I was on this website. I still will be. I'm just not a fan of them.\n\n\nI've been accused of being a negative person, but apparently being compared to Jay Z and the Wu-Tang Clan isn't the most flattering thing ever. This man has said he will see to it that the children take him out sometimes. The outting was pretty impressive. An elegant smile that taught me how to be a better person. The adult smiled that taught me to be a better person.\n\n\nThat's why I ask! Where are you going to get the money if you don't want it? This entire business is about money; you don't see many men in your life that love money.\n\n\n", "human": "6 Reasons to NEVER date a Single Mother\n\nPost by Older Bachelor on Dec 13, 2004, 7:40pm\n\nSingle mothers. Well, here are MY issues with them (This pertains to a woman who had a kid and never married, or divorced her husband because \"She wasn't happy\". If she had a good marriage and he died, there might be wiggle room, but I still wouldn't date her).\n\n1: She decided to have a kid without a husband. This demonstrates terrible, selfish values. It also shows that she thinks of men as sperm donors and child support payers, NOT husbands & fathers. What will happen if you knock her up? Get ready to pay up for a kid that you won't get to be a real dad to.\n\n2: In some states, you can be responsible for child support by just living with her. I don't want to pay for kids that aren't mine. Do you?\n\n3: False allegations of child abuse. It isn't likely, but I don't want to take that chance. Getting branded with a big \"M\" on your forehead (For Molester) will WRECK YOUR LIFE. It will never go away. Too big a risk.\n\n4: Relationship aren't easy as it is. Add a minor child and it really complicates the issue. Do you want to deal with her kid(s) too? You won't be their dad and they will know it. Their mom already fucked up their life by not having a dad for them, and is fucking it up more by bringing in \"Revolving door boyfriends\" into their life.\n\n5: Lots of single moms have financial problems. You will be obligated to help pay for sitters, food, braces, on and on. For children that aren't yours. Get the credit card out!\n\n6: There is NO reason to date one. Millions of women in this country are single with no kids, and in every age range. Go younger if you have to. Don't waste your time with a woman that has PROVEN that she doesn't want a husband for her and dad for her kids. Do you think she will change her mind for you? That she will forget her utter contempt for husbands and fathers just for you? Sure she will.\n\nI run into single mothers once in a while, and when \"I have a kid\" is revealed, that's the end of the conversation for me. I will be polite but I will still walk off, because I don't want anything to do with them. And neither will any other smart man.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nRe: 6 Reasons to NEVER date a Single Mother\n\nPost by SoCalPolki101 on Dec 14, 2004, 11:45am\n\nHogwash!

Or at least doesn't have a burning desire and need to start a family. UNLIKE the single no kids women out there who have their childbearing years AHEAD of them.\n\n2: In some states\u2026 living with her\u2026\n\nGet your story straight buddy. Look at your subject. Date and living together are two different things.\n\n3: False allegations of child abuse. Children in daycare years are asleep by 10PM. That's when you come over with the DVD and wine and cheese.\n\nSingle mothers with older children usually have arrangements for having men over which do not include contact with children. Like sleepovers at their friends, relatives, etc.\n\nYou bug out at night because a woman with small children doesn't want them to see you in the morning.\n\n4: Relationship aren't easy as it is.\n\nSingle mothers often want very casual come-on-over occassionaly relationships because their time is limited and schedule chaotic.\n\nSingle women have lots of free time on their hands. They have all kinds of recreational and emotional needs that need to be met.\n\n5: Lots of single moms have financial problems.\n\nBullcrap. Single moms these days live high off the hog. They have jobs and they also get help from dummy who got married and got them pregnant.\n\nAnd it never ceases to amaze how trailer trash can be so happy when you spend $10 at Trader Joes to buy some European delicacies for your late night come on over. $10 is what you'll spend on tips and parking on your single no kids date.\n\n6: There is NO reason to date one. Millions of women in this country are single with no kids,\n\nThat is exactly the reason to date one. Because single women don't have kids and will probably want kids.

{"eta": "In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of \"black\" skin and Asian features, there is little room for human agency. By viewing white skin as an ideal, but Asian skin as a real threat, white privilege and whiteness become projected onto Asians, making them invisible. Ahistorical, racialized race categories proliferate and exacerbate inequality within Asian societies, and allow political and social leaders to ignore and marginalize the grievances of ethnic minorities.\n\nThe essay \"Not My Whiteness\" explores Asian cultural representations that blame whiteness on Asian peoples for inferiority. One essay is titled \"All American Now: Why Whiteness Is Racist To The World.\" Apostates and Asian Americans under the spotlight of the campaign are irrationally worried that whiteness will use anti-Asian sentiment to justify discrimination against Asian Americans. Many of the authors wrote it. After reading \"Not My Whiteness,\" let me say for those who read it only to engage in racist online commentary, and who are thus convinced of a hierarchy of racial superiority:\n\nEverywhere in the world, there is a racial hierarchy, in which racial divisions come down to only whiteness, whether for entertainment purposes or for political ends. If you were born in America, then you are a white person and those who do not fit are not. Why is this? The reason is that when a black person appears, people see their race in his or her eyes and natural actions and expressions, and thus assume that they have the same perception of others. On the other hand, a white person who is half-white or a woman half-white, or whose entire face, body, and overall physical qualities resemble white people in appearance is viewed with suspicion, and such a person may not even be allowed to wear white. Thus, a white person can have any skin color or any nationality and still be viewed with suspicion because of their ethnicity or nationality. In the racial hierarchy of whiteness, whiteness is the most successful and most superior and the best of all racial hierarchies, regardless of the situation a racial group finds itself in, the reason this ranking is based upon whiteness itself, or the color of a body.\"\n\nWe arrive at the crux of the debate: Why does white America believe that Asian communities are the problem? Why does it insist on using anti-Asian rhetoric to deny \"privilege,\" yet clearly don't understand or care about non-black people, or doesn't care to understand or acknowledge the perspective of Asian Americans?\n\nTo answer these questions and more: Why do Asians struggle with or struggle with white supremacy? Because in the U.S., we are hyper-selected to be the only people in our society who share whiteness. Whites are a non-threatening minority within America; they have effectively handed \"white racial superiority\" to non-whites.\n\nBecause Asian immigrants are deemed a \"threat,\" they were shut out of social and economic processes until a Japanese-American journalist, Pearl S. Buck, openly wrote about white privilege from a Japanese-American perspective. Chinese American journalist Chan S. Hou pointed to this racially exploitative attitude when she wrote that Chinese Americans, in the eyes of whites, appear as violent and criminal toward foreigners. If an immigrant becomes white, especially a Japanese immigrant, then he is regarded as \"thug\" or a \"criminal\" whose criminal actions are committed because of his white skin.\n\nPeople in the Philippines view non-Indians as \"thugs\" as well. Women, by default, are perceived to be \"less than the guys,\" and those who are perceived as \"less than the guys\" are often ruthlessly raped, but some dare write things that are considered \"wrong.\" White Americans are deeply invested in racial and gender hierarchy, and have acted as gatekeepers and the glue to keep non-white ethnicities in the confines of white privilege. When Asians attempt to surpass whiteness, they are generally viewed with suspicion because they are not white as well. In the Philippines for example, the Philippine National Police recently raided more than 200 Facebook accounts, talking up one Taiwanese national in a headline that was all too similar to the FBI's \"Confessions of an Asian Fugitive.\" Another Chinese national in China is being accused of going to North Korea to buy a girlfriend.\n\nThe default perceptions of immigrants are summarized in a 2004 memo circulated by the Immigration and Nationality Services. This memo highlights the preoccupations of the U.S. government over \"ethnically and racially homogenous groups,\" and concluded that \"any admission of refugees would be selectively enforced.\" This memo was later found to reflect the policies of the Reagan administration, based on federal funding and program priorities. The report noted that: \"Whites, Blacks and Asian (except as stated otherwise) in the U.S. are in fact homogeneous.\"\n\nAfter this memo was leaked to the press in 2004, a public outcry followed. Bill Clinton", "topp": "In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of \"black\" skin and Asian features, when they are perceived to be imperfect they are subject to social adjustment.\n\nBut many Japanese-Americans, such as Susan Martinez, insist that stereotypes are not all they are made out to be. In many Japanese-American communities, they say, prejudice against a child of Japanese descent and his/her family is very real. They demand that school administrators stop calling their children stereotypes. Yet these so-called discrimination ordinances are legally pointless, because their purpose is to eliminate discrimination against only Japanese Americans.\n\nThe new intercity buses may have erased the fact that middle-class Japanese-Americans and their offspring were discriminated against more than 30 years ago. But we know what happens to young Japanese-Americans who choose to immigrate to America. M\u0101npu (yellow) blood so deeply intrudes into young Japanese-American and their families that it is virtually impossible for them to escape their label of \"nigra\" \u2013 poor. To escape, many young Japanese-Americans are forced to \"act like\" every other child in their grade or to provide the language and decorum that they were not raised with \u2013 most Japanese-Americans are not fluent in English. When they take any serious step in any occupation other than real estate, insurance, real estate design, and alternative medicine, they are often called \"Kowaro\" (dude) by their co-workers \u2013 the word \"Kowaro\" has the same meaning as in Japanese, so they just call them \"koware.\" They are constantly receiving lectures and treatment on the prejudice that they brought with them from \"those wretched, wretched Japanese\" who had no rights, were generally harassed and belittled, and are treated very differently than Chinese Americans, black Americans or Muslims in their communities. They are forced to learn another language, too.\n\nA child of Japanese descent can become a culture that interferes and interferes with the lives of Asian American children. Asian Americans cannot protest the ways that this bullying is not only wrong, but contributes to social malfunction.\n\nA child's skin color \u2013 in Japan, people with darker skin are referred to as Kota (yellow), and in the U.S., people with dark skin are referred to as Gaisos (dark). With all its cultures, color has a very concrete meaning. In Japan, lighter skin is in excess; when they choose to date someone with lighter skin they should thank their lucky stars that there are not children with darker skin with whom they would be fated to have an affair. A person with light skin is a curry.\n\nBut the fact is, Kota is sometimes called \"nigra\" (traitor), \"slob,\" or \"loser.\" Usually this is when she does something that we would prefer to call \"correct\" and she can be expected to apologize for it. But when Kota is injured, she is reduced to tears. She cries for help. She may be made to crawl before a beating. She may lose her friends, be cut off from her father, or be forced to leave her apartment.\n\nThe truth is that the U.S. and many Western countries view the Japanese-American civil rights struggle as a struggle against a racial slur. Such a struggle is part of what this magazine has called the colorblind world. My neighbors in Brooklyn have dark skin and expect that they should be on their guard; I always tell them that they would be at much greater risk if they acted with racist prejudice. This day-to-day brutality I experience affects me in every way \u2013 even from a point of view that is incompatible with my race. In fact, the Japanese-American civil rights struggle has a solid foundation in mutual respect. Over time, they have fought many battles for civil rights: in public schools, in academic institutions, and in law schools. Having achieved some level of civil rights, they want more.\n\nHowever, a larger problem exists. Due to the structural racism in Japan and the denial of civil rights that the Japanese-American community has suffered in our country for so long, not only are anti-racist laws and policies that acknowledge an Asian-American who happens to be of Asian descent unable to keep up with current events, but those who wish to change the society in which they live do nothing else but admit that society is discriminatory. When they say that the Japanese-American community is on the verge of civil rights they may seem sincere. But truth be told, they do not seem very sincere. That does not mean that the race question has been completely resolved, as their acceptance of ignorance and racism suggests. Just because the Klan and other racist groups in America do not have to state racism does not mean that there is no racism. In fact, the majority of Japanese-Americans are positive people who want to increase cooperation and understanding between Asian-Americans and other people", "human": "In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of \"black\" skin and Asian features, interracial and interethnic couples in Lebanon are abhorred, stigmatized and socially ostracised.\n\n\"I'm a stranger in my own country,\" Saeb Kayali, a Thai-Lebanese, told Al-Akhbar.\n\n\"Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public,\" \"I remember once a woman asked my friend, who happened to be right next to me, if I spoke Arabic,\" Kayali said, \"And I always get questions like 'Where are you from? Lebanon. No, where are you really from? Ummm, Lebanon. No, like where are your parents originally from?' And even after I explicitly tell them that I'm Lebanese they just continue asking.\"\n\nAs Kayali narrated countless instances of \"misunderstandings,\" Lebanon's racial bigotry, whether conscious or unconscious, and the long-ingrained notions of racial inequality, are very clearly present in today's society.\n\nPower institutions, including the societal body, are not only combating interfaith marriages but also interracial ones. While the need to overcome the former has vigorously surfaced in the last few years, the latter is still to be acknowledged and defied.\n\nBlatant racism\n\n\"Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public,\" Pi, a Filipina woman married to a Lebanese man, told Al-Akhbar.\n\nRacial intolerance in Lebanon has caused the alienation of mixed-race couples from family members, who disown them for marrying someone they consider to be 'inferior.' People of African or Asian heritage are automatically associated with allegedly 'inferior' domestic workers by virtue of their phenotype, and their identity is accordingly erased and replaced by an array of racist stereotypes.\n\n\"At first we didn't even hold hands in public. Then I asked him how is it okay for others to express hatred but not for us to express love?\" Pi added, \"now we act like any endogamous couple and if someone is disturbed he or she can simply look away.\"\n\n\"His family didn't speak to him for five years,\" Pi said, \"they didn't even know me, but my Filipina features were more than enough reason for them to disapprove of our marriage.\"\n\nAccording to Rana Boukarim, spokeswoman for the Anti Racism Movement in Lebanon, \"Many families eventually come to accept the interracial marriages, which may be seen as a decrease in racism. However, when questioned, these family members, who were initially against the idea, often say 'but she is different from other Filipinas'.\"\n\nMoreover, couples who are driven by love to cross the color line face socially-constructed derision because they, and their mixed-race children, provoke the invisible yet existing laws of racial segregation.\n\n\"They used to call me Oreo\"\n\n\"I remember one time, light-skinned Lebanese students refused to sit next to an Afro-Lebanese kid because they thought his dark skin color was 'contagious' and they feared they would turn black.\" Mixed-race children face blatant racism at school as their fellow classmates fail to censor their speech. While interracial couples are mentally and psychologically aware of notions of race and the difficulties that might be ahead in ethnically homogenous communities, their children are not.\n\n\"Back in preschool, kids used to call me 'blacky' or 'Oreo' as if my skin color is my name and identity,\" Walid Yassine, a 22-year-old Congolese-Lebanese told Al-Akhbar.\n\n\"I was called 'the Chinese kid',\" Kayali said, \"even though I'm not half Chinese to begin with.\"\n\nThrust into a world of racial stereotyping, mixed-race children experience disparities in self-esteem, self-degradation, and identity-related struggles.

{"eta": "Since Afreeca Freecs' top laner Jang \"MaRin\" Gyeong-hwan pulled out the splitpushing AD Kennen during the very first week of the new season, his struggles are all over the place. In the first week of their new LCS schedule, MaRin ended up with a 0.78 rating, which was second best among all AD players. During Week 1 he was on the losing side of 1.28 KDA, which was 1.32 percent higher than his overall average (1.18; rank #51 in the league). Thus MaRin looked like the worst Ivern ADC in the league in Week 1.\n\nBut then Week 2 started. After G2's first loss against Unicorns of Love in Week 1, MaRin's overall average plummeted. However, his first game in Week 2 against Complexity was the first time that MaRin's jungle side dominated in terms of performance. MaRin led the Jungle behind Wickd for the majority of the lane swapping for Complexity. Faced with a carry NoX Luna of Mastermind and the Twisted Fate Twitch of Sneaky, MaRin was able to dive directly into that map.\n\nWith just over 60 games played since Week 1 and over a third of the LCS playoffs games being on the new season schedule, MaRin appears to have reverted to being a tank/assassin. In particular, his highest-perceived rating of 3.29 now places him third in the league behind Dyrus in the bottom of Jungle and Highlord Jhin in the top of Mid, and behind Tyrande in the top of ADC. And as of the time of this writing, the gank-heavy MaRin has a -1.35 KDA in first two games on the new season.\n\nI have nothing new to add on MaRin; he's seen similar results throughout his career, and he will continue to do so. His most recent results are within consistent ranges from what he's had in previous years; his rating changes at the bottom of his slot, and has risen steadily from then point as well. Also, he may not have this issue once more, or they may be the results of this split.\n\nVoting history\n\nEden, the only other team that has played MaRin two weeks in a row so far, has seen a positive matchup split 7-0. The vote-giver is Ocelote. MaRin has played 498 games in the NA LCS and has been on seven different teams and has never scored more than a negative point in a match on the NA LCS. His notable accomplishments include a high-pointing 16-7 record on NME during his time with Incredible Miracle, a 13-12 record on bbq Olivers during his time with the Falcons; and a 7-8 record on Shield during his time with PENTA.\n\nBut MaRin has also seen successes on Complexity, Vulcun, Team Impulse, Cloud9, and FlyQuest, and he failed miserably on Fnatic during his last solo queue season, so he has to count at least three different teams as a consistent voting fixture over his entire career in the NA LCS. With that, here is how he has performed in the split and in the Playoffs so far as well.\n\nBoth Doublelift, Curse and Genesis have stuck with MaRin despite his early performances, at least in my opinion, so it is no coincidence that he isn't above two negative votes in a split. MaRin played 463 games over the course of his career and has played with four different teams and four different teams at different stages. For this data alone I am recommending MaRin get positive votes.\n\nThis graph says everything you need to know about MaRin.\n\nMy take\n\nThough MaRin took one game off of Maokai in his first match against Cloud9, he still had the worst Week 1 of any ADC in the league before Bjergsen came up to rescue him. MaRin finished the week by being one of the lowest rated ADC in the league, and by keeping it like that he was little better than a bottom tier ADC who still plays a much better game than Bjergsen. All of this makes me think that you need to have some confidence in your ADC, and they can't just make plays for you. If this is how Bjergsen has played all season, I don't find myself pushing MaRin as much, but even if MaRin wins just one match in the next three weeks or so it will still be worth picking to make moves on if you insist on picking him.", "topp": "Since Afreeca Freecs' top laner Jang \"MaRin\" Gyeong-hwan pulled out the splitpushing AD Kennen during the very semifinals, the most succesful team in the LCK, and the most unbeatable team of Korean League of Legends history made the odd appearance in the VoD's commentary segment where, serenely, they expressed uncertainty about the very events they were announcing:\n\n\n\u25b7TV Commentator: \"They have to earn their LCS spot.\"\n\n\u25b7Jang \"MaRin\" Gyeong-hwan: \"Oops!\"\n\n\u25b7Coach Lee \"Wisdom\" Min-ho: \"Everyone!

This was more of a narrative that the VOD team rewrote its words, his words, borrowed from Heroes of Newerth, describing how the junglers could not solo kill a Twisted Fate at level 5, that now not only did they have to support their team with Carries, but now also they had to wait for the wave clear from the other team before on-hit-or-miss junglers could get the kills. In that way, they were taking a page out of previously played Insec genre strategy, in which the Observer Warding System which had once been a funny piece of meta coining had now become the main reason why you could't win without Teleports.\n\n\nLike a Roar-pop song, they insisted, broadcast VODs suddenly were worthy of a more in-depth application. As I leave the theater, I ask this before leaving the subject of discussion for another day: Was this all just a fun hoax, of a mock-out editorial or misdirection I would heard elsewhere?\n\n\n****\n\n\nI would make it so that the narration was less subdued.\n\n\u25b2 After Taz teases the players with big worries like \"they are afraid of coming to Korean culture!,\" coach Lee has less questions to ask of their worried history.\n\n\u25b2One of the best sponsors was literally reserved only for broadcasting.\n\n\u25b2I don't know who Taz had ordered in the original text, but I'd bet G2 XellOs had one, as well.\n\n\u25b2Yumiko \"GNG LAGEE\" Hyogo at one point breaks the ice in the intro's commentary with a \"in Korean\" rather than \"in English.\" In his doubts, my colleague attempts to be conciliatory, not antagonistic, not respectful of what had just been said.\n\n\u25b2Ling \"You must take notice of it!\" during a tournament broadcast, the professional soccer player today is likely a baby.\n\n\u25b2Tencent editorialized pro players.

This is still true, as Kennen can very easily scale thanks to the lack of kill pressure that tanks generally have.\n\nWith the new midseason patch and attempt to shift kill pressure away from tanks once more, Kennen has continued to be a staple pick in the top lane against top lane champions just hoping to get out of the lane phase without a huge disadvantage. Kennen is a great bully and an even better scaling champion, letting his splitpush plan come to fruition and carry the game alone, if given enough room.\n\nRunes\n\n1 Attack Speed and 8 Attack Damage Reds, Armor Yellows, 3 Attack Speed and 6 Magic Resistance Blues, Attack Speed Quintessences\n\nThis rune page gives you a good balance of resistances, attack damage, and attack speed. Because of Kennen's W passive, he's more inclined to specialize in attack speed earlier, and more attack speed increases his sustain through Doran's Blade as well as his initial Blade of the Ruined King buy, making his dueling much better in the early and mid game stages.\n\nMasteries\n\nEighteen in Ferocity is pretty standard for auto attacking threats. Kennen has great synergy with Fervor of battle in particular, as the attack damage contributes to his W passive, which will give him greater burst damage as he builds up the empowered auto attack. Fresh Blood and Battle Trance help with laning without a downside, and Kennen needs the armor penetration over the magic penetration for his Blade of the Ruined King damage onto tanks despite his tendency to do slightly more magic damage (thanks to creeps having low magic resistance) over the course of the game.\n\nTwelve in Resolve keeps Kennen alive and allows him to threaten the splitpush much more often thanks to the use of Insight. Insight should be taken over Fearless because Kennen already gets a good chunk of resistances in fights through his E, making more resistance suboptimal versus having health to balance it out. As well, having Flash and Teleport up more often allows Kennen to make cross-map plays and use the utility of flash to escape sticky splitpush or teamfight situations. Veteran Scars and Tough Skin help optimize his early resistances and contributes to a brutal laning phase for the opponent as trading becomes more and more fruitless.\n\nSkill Order\n\nFirst six levels: QEWWWR\n\nGetting Q first is the best harass tool, and E afterwards helps escape any early cheese from the top laner or jungler. After, however, W is the skill you want to max. It helps with waveclear in conjunction with E, and actually scales with your total attack damage, increasing by level. This is AD Kennen's primary tool for dueling as it provides huge burst in lane in combination with an active W.\n\nAfter that, maxing E second helps with waveclear and gives you access to your escape much more often, making your splitpush a lot safer. Your ultimate should be leveled when possible, and your Q should be leveled last despite its early point as a harass tool.\n\nBuild Order\n\nThough Doran's Shield got a huge buff, it's still not a great choice for champions hoping to bully their lane as Kennen would. Rushing Blade of the Ruined King is a must, even though it got its cost very very slightly increased. After that, going Frozen Mallet will ensure that you will have the survivability and kiting ability to deal with any tank or fighter hoping to contest your presence in a side lane. Phantom Dancer adds to your attack speed and continues to help your survivability for a very low cost. Death's Dance got an insane buff in Patch 7.9 that helps Kennen's dueling substantially, and contributes to his W passive more than any other AD item given it having 80 attack damage. Guardian Angel helps as well, as it also now gives attack damage.\n\nDoran's Blade + Health Potion Blade of the Ruined King Mercury Treads Frozen Mallet Phantom Dancer Death's Dance Guardian Angel Maw of Malmortius or Runaan's Hurricane\n\nPlaystyle\n\nEarly game, Kennen's ranged advantage lends itself well to a favorable laning phase because he can easily harass and cs simultaneously. That combined with his good base damage on abilities allows him to trade against the patterns of most meta top laners. Kennen is fairly gankable, so make sure you're not pushing in.

{"eta": "1. Cold or frigid?\n\nPhoto: Niq Scott, Flickr\n\nStepping out of your door on a chilly winter's morning, you realise that you are walking through a half-immersion pool surrounded by rows and rows of snow. How on earth would you expect to get anywhere on these conditions? To your horror, you see a row of street lights down below your feet. Your first thought is not good: you are definitely going to lose your footing unless you take any precautions. So, you unsettle your surroundings, throw your feet back, and stumble about. You might be frozen, but your feet aren't: you've just walked in a half-intolerable snow field! What is it that you didn't know, and where did you get it from?\n\nThe half-inhabitants are the Russians. They began building their snowpits even before the first world war. Once again, they've been successful.\n\nWhy did they start making snowpits in the first place? According to one publication from the early 20th century, they decided, on the grounds that \"all would benefit from the passive power of a truly maddeningly strange phenomenon\". By using heated steel poles at a fairly deep depth, in temperatures of just a couple of degrees above zero, they could create a white material that was hard but still soft enough to withstand the cold. For many years, snow in Moscow has been sustained thanks to the fact that the Russians literally overrode the people's instinct to tread on snow.\n\nIt all started from this and, although they have been spending much of their lives now doing the deed, this is the reason why winter is gradually receding in the Soviet Union: they have started to say \"yes\" to the idea that people should feel the cold instead of having to tread on it. They're not entirely making up for what they used to do not long ago: in the extreme north of Siberia, you can hear people asking in their earpieces for \"snowmen\" to come and help them shovel their way through the fields.\n\n2. Running short of snow\n\nPhoto: ALITWOC, Fotolia\n\nYou are halfway through the snow and you realise that there is still no sign of the 1.9 metre thick snow that is just waiting to fall. You reach into the pocket of your coat, take out your wad of cash, and ask for some snow.\n\nWell, now you have some cash. That would be nice and all, but on some of the very first days of winter, how is it that you are permitted to get more than a handful of snow per day? But at least you can afford to pay the cost of for two people to drive around the Siberian tundra, a journey that will likely take you around three hours just to access a single store (if you are lucky and can bring at least some snow and ice cover), without ever venturing into the kopecks region. This has made it possible for all the locals to always have plenty of snow to sell, with the park the only exception. As a result, the Russian market has adapted to the breakneck pace of the industry. With the potential for millions of acres to be flooded because of a lack of snowfall in one location, the local kopecks are traditionally a very affordable haven for the insane to come and buy.\n\nSo are the Russians just the most irresponsible people in the world? Not at all, according to some of the experts I've met.\n\nOndo Konstamieva of the Centre for National Scenarios at the University of Krasnoyarsk told me that he knows of two people in his department who, \"during normal circumstances, pay a little more than 30 rubles for a single parcel of snow\". Again: that is very little to eat on a Russian diet. When discussing a modern international deal for railway technology, Dr Mika Isoknowa of the Geological Institute at Chkalov, told me that she had once had to pay \"well over 4,000 rubles\" for a parcel of snowfall she actually managed to enjoy, though she reckoned that it the average person on a luxury summer holiday would struggle to afford an eighth of that.\n\n3. Dragging snow into a bag\n\nHere is the old axiom: snow drags. In the north, it drags people with it. In the south, it drags animals and other valuable goods. How did this happen? The reason is pretty simple: the central part of the continent has an extremely cold centre, just like the centre of America does today, and no one likes to live in the hot, dry heat north (if it's not, I don't know what is.) So, it's rather unfortunate that in Siberia, people create snow for personal use rather than for industrial applications. They throw off big clouds of thick snow, which allows trees", "topp": "1. Cold or frigid?\n\nPhoto: Niq Scott, Flickr\n\nStepping out of your door on a chilly winter's morning, you realise that you've left your warm jacket unzipped and you're suddenly frozen in place. Your legs automatically adjust themselves to the unzipped jacket, and a second later you're nip-zipping away in two!\n\nUsually, it would be a trip back in the car or turning left at red lights to get to your destination; however, according to by Tim Pringle, the author of the blog '20(ish) Questions about Arising from the Sizzling of Ice', a winter's morning o'the-zen might be taken as a quick retreat to the company's ski house for a later outing, with your only companion to worry about being the other stranger you picked for a final destination swap.\n\nThe effect might be small, but here, the fact that you're merely tweaking an oversized climate control system doesn't do much to help your mood, and Pringle has told how clients can be up out of their skins after sharing such a cramped lodge room with a new roommate.\n\n2. Spending time alone\n\nThe Arctic tundra seems to hold many secrets for the those who wish to seek out its secrets. After a visit to the arctic tundra in November 1995, snow was buried in such places that every passerby I observed was completely perplexed. I often felt both guilty and intrigued when unusual things were found. It was almost like tourists were following in their footsteps.\n\nCan you imagine setting up a speed boat against the 9.5 inches of snow below the Tunguska River after seeing just what has been buried for so long and hoping there would be something green on it?\n\nBut if you can remember all of the things that little girl kept in a suitcase after she left her house in Maine in 1995, I think you'd find that they've been found on every trip ever taken since.\n\nCertainly, the possible hidden secrets in the Arctic tundra are limitless, so looking for them might yield similar results to finding hidden treasures in Antarctica. The immense volcanic ash layers beneath the surface of the Arctic Ocean are rather more complex to spot (As it happens, I wasn't able to find much information on this in a following days trip to the Laptev Sea in it's large stores of war and trade), but it might be a very safe bet to try something that I wrote in the book \"Pagan Haunts\" about how Dr. Thomas T. Jenkins may have been able to find this particular anomalous area following a trip to Siberia in 1997.\n\n3. No, you haven't got the hots for normal bathhouses\n\nPhoto: Juley V\u00e4\u00e4ma, Flickr\n\nIf you have already looked at the above section for more reasons why you shouldn't look for cold activities in the Arctic tundra, then you might have been thinking, \"I should never, ever go to bed! Every night, I could be up naked in the Arctic tundra with nothing but the snowy sands on my back and ants crawling on my car as I attempt to unwind.\"\n\nSo you have decided that the colder of the two polar regions might be to your taste, but why not venture to one of the many hot bath houses or running hot springs that might be available in them?\n\nWhat's even more amazing? Hot springs can be artificially warmed by a click of a button like any other option on earth. Nevertheless, many of them simply don't survive the plunge into the tundra, and you might think you can find the perfect one but it always seems to be right on the edge. It's a fine bit of additional tourist-fluff.\n\n4. I'm tired! Let's take a plunge!\n\nMost people are off-duty and will sleep it off from 11.30am - 6.00pm, but the instant one crew member catches the wind of wind down on him, the freedom of others means there's a need to gather up the party and head off for a time. Should you choose to undertake this activity, then try to stay above the ground as much as possible. Accompanying yourself is no more relaxed than if you're in a room of the perfect hotel and leaving you the same \u2013 uncomfortable for both of you.\n\nOf course, if you're going to go with an arctic explorer, then that just means you'll be one of the first to exit the last ship. Still, that's inevitable if you're thinking of going down there; some people might think it is a cheap shot but it might make more sense for everyone involved in the expedition, and surely by the time you're on the boat, you might be more relaxed than you may think.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're keen to maintain a sense of adventure as you drift down to the goo or just have", "human": "1. Cold or frigid?\n\nPhoto: Niq Scott, Flickr\n\nStepping out of your door on a chilly winter's morning, you realise that you haven't got nearly enough layers on, and through your chattering teeth you exclaim, \"Ich bin kalt!\"\n\nBut what you thought was an innocent enough exclamation actually has other implications - you'll unwittingly be announcing to everyone that you are frigid.\n\nTo avoid being the laughing stock, don't forget that all-important reflexive pronoun - make sure you say \"mir ist kalt\" instead.\n\n2. Cherries or churches?\n\nPhoto: strollerdos, Flickr\n\nIt's a beautiful afternoon and you're feeling peckish, so what better way to fit right in with the locals than to enjoy the Austrian custom of \"Kaffee und Kuchen\" (coffee and cake)?\n\nDon't make the rookie error of ordering \"ein Kuchen mit Kirchen\" instead of \"ein Kuchen mit Kirschen\".\n\nOrder the latter and you'll get a delicious cake with cherries on top. Order the former (a cake with churches on top) and you'll be met with utter confusion.\n\n3.

Ah grammar, how we love you.\n\n4. Cross the road or crucify the road?\n\nPhoto: Thomas Szynkiewicz, Flickr\n\nAlthough \"das Kreuz\" means \"a cross\", using the verb \"kreuzigen\" to refer to crossing the street is a big no-no: you'll inadvertently be saying that you want to crucify the road.\n\nGet the correct verb down in your vocab book - it's \"\u00fcberqueren\".\n\n5. Tasty or laughable?\n\nPhoto: Anastasia Liem, Flickr\n\nEven the best of intentions can sometimes go awry. Eagerly telling your Austrian hosts at dinner, \"Das Essen ist l\u00e4cherlich!\", will not have the desired effect.\n\nInstead of expressing gratitude for such a delicious meal, you will instead be saying that the food is laughable or even ridiculous.\n\nInsulting your hosts will not win you any brownie points, so to avoid getting off on the wrong foot with them, choose the adjective \"lecker\" instead - you'll charm them in no time.\n\n6. Friend or girlfriend?\n\nPhoto: Brett Sayer, Flickr\n\nLinguistically, the lines between purely platonic friendships and romantic relationships can often be blurred in German, as the word \"Freund\" can signify either a friend or a boyfriend.\n\nIf you want to escape the minefield of accidentally implying romantic interest when there is none whatsoever, use \"ein Freund von mir\" instead.\n\n7. Mist or dung?\n\nPhoto: Pimthida, Flickr\n\nIt's a grey and miserable morning, and swathes of mist greet you as you walk out of your door.\n\nExclaiming \"es gibt so viel Mist!\" will not convey that there is a great cloud of mist stifling the air, but rather that there is a lot of dung strewn about, so it's best to avoid this word unless you're on a farm.\n\nBut in spoken German, \"Mist\" has another meaning - it's a swearword that you'll hear people on the railway station platform muttering angrily when they miss their train. When you start swearing in German, that's when you know you've moved well and truly past the novice stage and become a true local.\n\n8. Gift or poison?\n\nPhoto: Andrew Kuznetsov, Flickr\n\nWant to make a good first impression?\n\nEnthusiastically offering your host family a \"Gift\" upon arriving in Austria is definitely the wrong way to go about it, as this false friend means \"poison\".\n\nIn your eagerness to be polite and to express your gratitude, you'll be offering them a present which is worlds apart from the tea and chocolate they expected.\n\nIf you'd rather not muck up the very first encounter you have in Austria, use the word \"das Geschenk\" instead.\n\n9.

{"eta": "ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION:\n\nTable of Contents \u2014In Rabbinical Literature:\n\nAn expression occurring in Matt. xxiv. 15 and Mark, xxi. 15, \"Why do you go forth as wild beasts in the wilderness?\" is often said to be the question of the prophet Haggai to the prince Jonathan as he was leaving Jerusalem, when he was being presented before the high priest, as he would not keep Sabbath-breaking (Jap. iii. 12, 20).\n\n2. HAGGAI'S QUETZATES:\n\nHagge. describes how the heathens began to blaspheme by showing themselves more manly, by flattering the beautiful, and then by blaspheming the holy and righteous (Verse 13), when they prayed \"Lord, I pray thee,... (Ps., vi. 12, \"For thou, Lord, art holy, for ever and ever, and will incline me to thy holy habitations.\" Compare Gemar, fol. 6. 2, &c. and Shemoneh. ed. Aboth, fol. 59. 2), their characters being of a different hue from that which they had been accustomed to: by which, he says, it is manifest to us that they knew not the perfect happiness which God has bestowed on us (Verse 20).\n\nThis expression occurs in Gleanings, vii. 30-51, in connection with the text of Isaiah, i. 33 (thou hast pleased me; thou made me to be a whole people; Thou hast created me to rejoice in thy love and wisdom, and joy in thy name, thou made me to enter in and dwell in thy land, to be filled with wisdom. Thy servant shall read the words of the prophets and the minds of all thy people.\" The \"words\" refer to the words of Isaiah and are translated \"lustre,\" \"shine,\" \"horn,\" etc.; although the expression, and the phrase, are sufficiently general, and apply to the whole earth.\n\nThe most striking instance of this sacred expression, according to Haggai, appears in the utterance of a divinity in the Gospel of Luke (Luke x. 4) to one who had been a model of religion to him, and was filled with the spirit of union with God. \"If he had been male, and not yet been brought forth in the flesh, ye know that the resurrection of the dead is by the man who is raised from the dead\" (xxiv.).\n\nThe \"headless Jesus\" (Ac. xviii. 12) is one of the less clear of the Haggai words. He speaks of the body of Christ as existing for a short time before it turned to stone, when it was separated from His divine and spiritual nature. The meaning may be that of the words of St. Paul, as in Acts xxx. 31: \"The body of Christ, which now is, is not the same body that... was, but is become the body of Christ, that which is seen of earthly life is no longer a body\" (Luther, Syriac, Hans, ed. Froissart & H. Shatz, p. 289). Haggai has the following words: \"Why did you add to the natural body that which is spiritual?\"\n\nEven as much as the apostle himself, whose example he cites in Rom. xliv. (citing that passage) and the testimonies of his contemporaries (Alexander). Marcellinus remarks, in the context of this scene, that \"nature is considered a holy deposit in the form and institution of Christ which is liable to decay.\" For all this Haggai has found the words of God Himself, although he is limited in his direct comparison of the words of Paul, \"for to every one thereof is given the use of the Spirit, to obey the true rule of justice, and to keep the faith, (Ver. 13.) as these words of St. Paul have the sign of the Lord; and consequently this revelation is considered, whether or no it be the same man; and not that of any other, inasmuch as that which we see is not our Lord and our God.\" And further: \"it matters not, the light of our eyes, whether our eye be of thy wisdom or the brightness of thy knowledge (i.e., our faith\"). Nor is the good or evil which can be effected by man, according to the bestial policy or intention of God (Ps. xvii. 30), effected by virtue or defect of faith. For our nature and the nature of the Saviour He is a manifest, and moreover a perfect, agent. If, therefore, the prophet Haggai has thought that the Apocalypse of John, the disciple of the Lord having been present with him in Bethlehem and talked with him about the affairs, has a different form from the earlier writing, and especially from its form, which", "topp": "ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION:\n\nTable of Contents \u2014In Rabbinical Literature:\n\nAn expression occurring in Matt. xxiv. 15 and Mark, x. 27, and in Judg. iii. 16:\n\nA THOUSAND [or] TWENTY bears not the name of a multitude, for then the other signifies only the one person multiplied.\n\nof anger at the multitude, in the same sense, as the multitude of children in who has not even one lie.\n\nIn Kohelet, xvi. 12:\n\nRabbi, that you should offend the rabble and mock them with your evil words, in the same sense, as your father and mother are offended by your evil words and say to you, 'See now, all is well in this world,' in spite of their light-mindedness.\"\n\nTouching 1 Kings, xii. 21.\n\nMaintain Your Pride; Observe The Feast at All Times:\n\nEspkaz, line 64, reading \"For as my servants who have eaten the great Godless Meals, shall be wont by morning to say, and by evening to call to the forgiveness of their sins,\" which suggestned an attempt to emulate in their reverent tones the self-contentions of their ancestors who so evinced themselves entitled to the epic of Isaiah\u2014and not as regards the absurd traditionary traditionalizing of their ancient Godists\u2014as having been his Fellows.

Weiss, 107), and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with Ezra, ix. 3, 4, \"motionless abomination\" or, also, \"appalling abomination.\" The suggestion of many scholars-Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others\u2014that , as a designation for Jupiter is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation \"Baal Shamem\" ( , \"lord of heaven\") is quite plausible, as is attested by the perversion of \"Beelzebub\" into \"\u0392\u03b5\u03b5\u03bb\u03b6\u03b5\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\" (Greek version) in Mark, iii. 22, as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli 'Ab. Zarah, 46a, that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form (see the examples quoted there). Though the expression \"Abomination of Desolation\" is accordingly recognizedin the light of this interpretation as a mistranslation of the phrase used in Daniel, there is no doubt that in the circles directly influenced by the Book of Daniel\u2014the same circles that originated the apocalyptic literature\u2014the expression was employed to designate an important eschatological conception. For it is only in an eschatological sense that the expression can be adequately explained in the New Testament passages above mentioned.\n\nAccording to most modern commentators, these passages are a Jewish apocalypse, somewhat tinged with Christianity, intended to prophesy the end of time, when the Antichrist, as the Abomination of Desolation, shall be enthroned as a ruler in God's Temple. The closely related \"smaller Apocalypse\" in II Thess. ii. 1-12 is a conclusive justification of this view; for it shows that neither the Romans (as Weiss in his commentary, ad loc., holds), nor the Zealots (Bleek, \"Synoptische Erkl\u00e4rung,\" and others), nor Caligula with his self-deification (Spitta, in his \"Offenbarung Johannis\") can be intended.\n\nThe rabbis as a whole consider that the expression refers to the desecration of the Temple by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts by Antiochus Epiphanes (see Apostemos ). Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who, as related in II Chron. xxxiii. 7, set up \"a carved image . . . in the house of God\" (Yer. Ta'anit, iv. 68a, and Rashi on the passage in Babli, ibid. 28b). The Haggadah narrates that two statues were erected, one of which fell over upon the other and broke off its hand. Upon the severed hand the following inscription was found engraved: \"I sought to destroy God's house, but Thou didst lend Thy hand to its protection\" (Ta'anit, 28b et seq.; compare Rabbinovicz, \"Vari\u00e6 Lectiones,\" on the passage for variant readings).\n\nBibliography: Compare modern commentators\u2014Meinhold, Bevan, Weiss, Prince\u2014upon the passages in Daniel and Matthew;\n\nalso Bousset, Der Antichrist, English translation, 1896, especially index;\n\nSpitta, Offenbarung Johannis, pp. 493-497;\n\nGr\u00e4tz, Gesch. d.

In order to understand the universe and the universe's meaning, we must contemplate reality at its highest, most incredible dimensions.\n\nNo one can look beyond what is under our direct control. You and your children are the last people who should set the bar for yourself and others. You are responsible for the fate that is now fixed. If you want to make the most of your precious time, learn to grasp it in the present moment.\n\nMirror Traced is a holistic, long-term, investing methodology that leads to profound insights; gains or losses that greatly outnumber those of any other investment approach. The mirror method enables you to decipher and analyze what life truly is like; to wonder and have the curiosity to remain curious. This approach allows you to read into the past (as we are all capable of), into the future (as we will be compelled to do) and into the present (as it really is all around you).\n\nMirror Traced enables you to not only see past what is in front of you and right to the very horizon, but also to see what life is as it truly is -- a lesson that can apply across a broad range of issues. It leads you to best understand yourself and your future, but also to make plans that will turn the world of finance around.\n\nMirror Traced is the only approach to investing that generates results, that allows results to follow the money -- exactly as it should. The goal is to lead you into investment success. A $1million investment under any conditions leads to a modest $65,000 and this is not an exaggeration.\n\nMirror Traced differs from the traditional market-based approach in that it teaches you to understand that money becomes a vehicle to create a benefit in your life; to recognize that luck can play a decisive role in the future; to recognize how central your $20,000 investments are in keeping your family, friends and resources happy; to realize that the most efficient way to face your future is through creativity; and most importantly, to know that the next hurdle to overcome has already been jumped.\n\nMirror Traced is, in essence, \"The ultimate package\" -- an insight to empower your life and the life of your friends and family to be the fullest of success.\n\nThe 2 R's That Truly Earn Money Today\n\nWorking from home (TWIL) can be an immensely rewarding job; equally as rewarding for those who are into hard work and working as in trying to get ahead at work; yet you can lead a TWIL life, whether you choose to work from home or work from home, that leads you to earn more money today.\n\nTWIL can (and should) be a path of achievement. If you fall in love with the work rather than the paycheck and \"work\" less than you would with the paycheck, you can literally take it to the next level of success for the rest of your life. Getting ahead of your competition is the key and a top goal for achieving your career objectives.\n\nTilting away from a TWIL life is going to find yourself trying to work as hard as possible at a fraction of the pay. There are times when you simply cannot do the amount of work to fill out a work-at-home position that will be worth $40,000 per year. Yet once you can make that amount of money with that position, if you want to remain relevant, you need to make sure you continue to work as hard as possible and get more paid. Your job should be about work and not about money, and so it should be. To accomplish this, you need to realize, take on a job-at-home (TWIL) experience that has a sustained positive impact in your life and as it affects your career, it becomes a constant pathway to furthering your career and personal development.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in five years?\n\nAnd you see yourself falling off a cliff in five years? You need to know where you see yourself in five years and how to shore up this way of looking at your position. Get realistic expectations, budget for your commitments and let your perspective in life be what is truly yours.\n\nStep 1 of 2: 3,500 Hours Worked per Year 10,000 Hours Worked per Year 5,000 Hours Worked per Year 20,000 Hours Worked per Year\n\nStep 2 of 2: 7,500 Hours Worked per Year 12,500 Hours Worked per Year 9,500 Hours", "topp": "\"What's your very best personal excellence tip?\" Sixty-six engaged Litemind readers took the challenge and now share with us advice on what makes the most positive impact. Below are nine tips for those seeking to become one step ahead of their investors.\n\n1. Spend the required times with family\n\nWhen investors need to meet face-to-face, a time is almost always needed.\n\n2. Listen and respect your client's needs\n\nFor some time now in the financial industry, consumer finance experts have known that some folks are not very informed about banking and other financial services.\n\nI often think about this when I'm making a presentation to someone new to my job, especially if they're less than 100% certain of what exactly they need. Sometimes it's tempting to simply hand you a friend and family member \u2014 preferably at night, so you can hear each other from time to time and get a sense of whether they believe what you're telling them.\n\nThis works one time or the other, and is your best bet for building trust and rapport. Whether they're doctor or doctor, lawyer or lawyer, salesperson or salesperson, we get by with diligence \u2014 and sharing with people what we know to be true.\n\nNo matter who you are, or what you do, if you wish to leave a positive impression upon your customers and convince them that investing in financial services is better than sending money to a wide variety of other investment options, you must spend time with them and listen for their needs and goals.\n\n3. Learn to listen\n\nAs you're meeting new clients, be sure to listen to their questions. Where are they coming from, what do they need, when will it be convenient to become a customer, what would they be willing to pay for their decision? Make sure to develop meaningful listening skills because trust is earned more through that connection than an obvious verbal answer.\n\n4. Avoid proprietary meetings\n\nMore often than not, a third-party approach is not a necessary step in building trust \u2014 especially when it comes to building relationships. Put yourself in their shoes \u2014 they might feel a little frustrated to not have access to clients they've never visited, or not get a status update on what they're doing.\n\nIn fact, unless you run a business, the last person you want to win the trust of is the third-party ticket taker who can't keep up with your strategy or your time-tracking systems.\n\nIt doesn't help that third-party companies often tell you what to do and how to deliver results in the short term with no real evidence of real results over the long term.\n\n5. Learn what your audience wants\n\nYou want the right answers. Ask questions that will help you to understand the needs of your clients. Most importantly, you need to make sure that what you provide fits the needs of your target audience.\n\n6. Passionate engagement\n\nGreat listening requires a significant amount of investment in passion \u2014 the willingness to look past your limitations and listen to your audience, as well as the will to learn, research and act on their most important insights. Regardless of your income, it's always better to be passionate about something, anyway. That's how you become great at what you do.\n\n7. Be bold\n\nLike any relationship, financial services offers many ways in which we connect with each other. Often, it helps to show off an idea in your presentation that you haven't even considered, then explain why it's awesome while pointing out any weaknesses. Doing this at work is smart, and can also help you build real rapport with your audience.\n\nHowever, like any relationship, it's important to be thoughtful in your presentation. That means that you shouldn't be exciting you think your prospective client might be, or describe your whole offering only to be presented with caveats. Instead, make sure you take into account those who are already investment bankers, bankers and other financial professionals, who will always have the upper hand, especially in a conversation of the type in which they're trying to craft a pitch.\n\nAlso, remember that investing at a company or organization with big or extremely large debts can present a number of challenges to young and new investors. If it's not planned, it doesn't matter how enthusiastic, filled with ideas or enthusiastic you seem, but it might make it difficult for you to become a financial professional. Learn from it and move on.\n\n8. If you don't need the heart but want to learn\n\nI recently spoke with a woman who shares her story with me as an example of how personal experience can have a profound impact on her life. The woman I'm speaking with has been burned too many times by senior financial advisors to know exactly what it's like to have an experience like hers.\n\nDespite having acquired tremendous amounts of money over the years \u2014 possibly more than she could ever manage on her own \u2014 she remains a victim of what she believes to be the irrational", "human": "\"What's your very best personal excellence tip?\" Sixty-six engaged Litemind readers took the challenge and now share with us advice on what makes the most positive impact on their lives.

And it's within this single step that lessons are learned, directions are given, and mistakes have already been made a thousand times over. It is in fact this single step that provides us with an opportunity to learn from all those who came before us and to lay down the seeds of personal evolution and change. Learning from another's experience could be the most important factor towards achieving any kind of success in life. [details] (by Adam Sicinski) Be careful when comparing yourself to others. You know everything about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your successes, and your failures. All you know about others is what they've chosen to show, and that would usually be only their success. List everything good about yourself and say, \"Hey, I have a good personal r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Look at all I have achieved and what I can learn and achieve.\" You can then go out feeling good and prepared for whatever challenge the world presents for you.

When someone is presenting ideas or theories to me, I think of Feynman to hone my powers of critical thinking and my BS detector. (by Mike Yoke) Practice meditation regularly. Learn a proven and effective method of meditation, set a manageable routine, and keep to it. The objectivity and clarity of mind produced will help in all aspects of your life, from the mundane to the elevated. [details] (by Reddy Kilowatt) Use mind maps to quickly review books you've read. As I'm reading a book, I populate a mind map that I have started for that book. I jump between the book and the mind map after completing a major section or sometimes a whole chapter. This method has increased my comprehension of the topics covered in books 1000-fold. What's more, I can look at a mind map of a book and within minutes recall important lessons learned in the book. I also use the mind map to point me to those parts of the book where I want to quickly review a specific topic. (by Llewellyn) Serve. My personal excellence tip is just that \u2013 serve. If in all that I do, I do in a spirit of being of service to the other, I win all the time. This has been my experience and the reason for my very successful life as a professional manager.

{"eta": "Enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) continues to be a high priority area for the SEC. In 2010, the SEC's Enforcement Division created a specialized unit to focus on domestic and foreign cases. The unit receives almost exclusively complaints concerning payments from government-owned banks, credit unions or foreign entities. The SEC's specific areas of focus include those transactions that flow through the open-end investment vehicles in which the firms that are being investigated do business. In 2011 and 2012, the SEC's Enforcement Division submitted nearly 1,000 civil complaints.\n\nEnforcement on Litigation: In the private equity and sovereign wealth funds, litigation is a key industry tactic. The SEC has enforcement obligations to investigate fraud. This investigation also allows the company to provide some degree of transparency, as even though securities fraud is defined by an SEC order under paragraph 1.2(c)(1)(iv) of the SEC Act as those violations \"impairing the public interest,\" the phrase can generally, but not necessarily, be waived based on the presence or absentiveness of misconduct, and even though the SEC can pursue infringement complaints with respect to stock and options awards. The cases mentioned on this page are examples of various types of litigation.\n\n\"Rebounded,\" \"Landed\" and \"Approved\": Companies that fall in the category of receiving regulatory scrutiny can use this to claim they have met their obligations and obtain regulatory approval as part of the ongoing review process. Occasionally this can trigger public disclosure of the SEC's investigation or even a specific penalty for the firm.\n\nSome fraud becomes eligible for an SEC Commission approval if:\n\nit is a \"planned conduct\" under the SEC Rule 25(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Securities Act or Exchange Act)\n\nthe company has settled the matter in advance, including a written promise to never do what it is alleged, or has issued a written release of non-liability\n\nit has already reached an agreement to resolve the charges under state law and\n\nit has complied with prior SEC orders and other entities have indicated satisfaction with the procedures being followed.\n\nBefore it issues a consent finding, the SEC investigates the charges and if there are extenuating circumstances, the SEC's consent finding generally instructs the company to do more. The SEC publishes a List of Notice Requirements to Help Investors Determine whether an SEC Consent Commitment Is Valid for the Case.\n\nThe SEC or its staff may seek the employer of an employee to step in and serve as a consultant on the firm and ensure compliance with order requirements. Once approved, the SEC may negotiate a settlement of the SEC's case or issue a consent determination. If a settlement has been reached, the transaction is usually \"adjusted\" as a result to reflect the loss of the order.\n\nWhen a company has already had a consent determination made and has been granted permission to issue settlement options subject only to an \"out-of-court\" waiver of the applicable SEC requirements, the SEC will generally seek approval from the federal appellate courts or the U.S. Supreme Court before issuing a consent determination.\n\nOnce the consent determination has been made by the SEC, the company can file with the SEC for protection, set forth its case under the Investment Company Act, file for court review, or seek various other relief.\n\nThe SEC, in its discretion, will take action to facilitate compliance or to prevent misconduct. Among those actions taken by the SEC are:\n\nbanning any future fraudulent activity by the company by affecting its shareholders or customers through disgorgement, whether or not the company acted with actual knowledge of the fraud or its effects or that it did so with knowledge of the potential consequences;\n\nseeking to determine whether there is reason to believe that the company has engaged in other fraud or other violations; and\n\nenforcing order requirements.\n\nPrior to making any final decision regarding the accused company, the SEC will notify the Commission and the parties of the allegations and conduct of its investigation and will look to minimize or prevent such violations from ever happening again. If the government disagrees with the SEC's findings and initial consent decision, it may appeal the SEC's decisions.\n\nThe SEC's investigations may also yield private information, as part of its existing jurisdiction such as federal and state law or by way of subpoena or other legal process. This information is gathered voluntarily and held in a general record by a security or e-mail database, such as, but not limited to, the Commission's Antitrust Division and its Combined Enforcement Offices. You may obtain information from information@sec.gov.\n\nIn addition, the SEC will present these findings and order transactions to make certain determinations or otherwise coordinate with the Department of Justice's enforcement operations to assist in the development of appropriate sanctions.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\n\nSettlement of SEC Rule 2C: In addition to potential settlement of a rule violation, the SEC, in the interest of fair and efficient investigations, proceedings and enforcement,", "topp": "Enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) continues to be a high priority area for the SEC. In 2010, the SEC's Enforcement Division created a specialized Fraud Unit that includes staff specialists with expertise in the enforcement of the FCPA and had substantial additional resources to respond to increasingly complex issues posed by foreign corruption. In July 2011, the SEC's Enforcement Division charged Madoff in connection with securities fraud.\n\nMany: Persons related to the Ponzi scheme have been charged with working as managers of Washington Mutual and, since September 2008, have been subject to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Thus far, 33 individuals, primarily in the U.S., have been charged under the FCPA and 6 had received a summons. Virtually all have pled guilty.\n\nPonzi schemers and pyramid schemers have gone unpunished and continue to operate in the United States.\n\nDuring the past few years, foreign nationals and individuals suspected of being involved in the Ponzi scheme have flowed into the United States, although both are rare. Almost every state reported 1 arrest in 2011; in many of these states the suspected Ponzi scheme was localized or local. As of March 2012, 25,019 persons had been charged under the FCPA in the U.S., and 62,608 persons had pleaded guilty or been convicted.\n\n\nPopularly known as \"The Czar of Foreign Corrupt Practices,\" the best-known example of what the FCPA prohibits is that of Paul Ponzi. His scheme quickly outpaced the ability of victims to pay; banks, leading industries, and other institutions borrowed money from Ponzi for buy-ins (bidders) and bought Treasuries with these borrowings at inflated prices. The scheme collapsed after a failed attempt to force the U.S. Treasury to seize the fund. The SEC has been primarily successful in pursuing Ponzi scheme targets whose accounts have been frozen or who have been debarred from participating in certain federal finance organizations, an approach that may be expanded to include more targeted firms and industries if necessary.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. criminal justice system began aggressively collecting on Russia's promises of aid to fight the crisis. In 2011, the tax fraud laws in the United States were developed, despite the funding gap in the United States. Since the closing of the voluntary repatriation agreement between the U.S. and Russia, the U.S. Government has developed plans to collect on the new payment obligations. The U.S. was able to collect 2.2 billion rubles, or $300 million, from the Russian Government to support necessary recovery activities. This is the first time the U.S. has formally done so.\n\nThe Criminal Code, Revised Penal Code, and special law enforcement legislation increased the number of prison sentences and made it easier to destroy property and execute property crimes. The legislation increased the maximum penalty for crimes of money laundering and finance schemes. Under the Criminal Code, national punishment for the importation of money into the country increased from 25 years to 50 years. Under the Revised Penal Code, the maximum sentence for crimes of financial frauds, fake documents, and terrorist acts and operations doubled from four to eight years. The revised law made its secondary effect provisions binding on the Federal Government until further direction from the Prosecutor General.\n\nDuring 2010, for the first time in Russia, private investigative reporting, including such traditional criminal matters as organized crime, was encouraged in a broad manner. As Russian news organizations gained a wider public foothold in government institutions, the establishment of an independent investigative agency was regularly discussed.\n\nDuring 2011, the impact of sanctions on Russia's ability to obtain information abroad increased dramatically. During the first three months of 2011, the number of enterprises in Russia that were found to be reporting foreign jurisdiction taxes to internal tax authorities worldwide was unknown. Large transaction fees, taxes imposed on other government and private organizations, and laws discouraging business cooperation with authorities abroad increased the difficulties in obtaining information.\n\nBy spring of 2010, the growing dependence on petroleum income was leaving the Federal Government (with the \"Directorate of Economic Development\" as in the U.S.) and the Central Bank (using the name \"CECOM\" under the Kremlin) with little alternative.

{"eta": "Analysis of Cincinnati shooting's aftermath reveals how multiple officers discussed claim \u2013 disputed as the basis of a murder charge \u2013 that Ray Tensing was 'dragged' by unarmed black man\n\nOfficer Ray Tensing's attorney said early on Thursday that he was still considering an appeal against a murder charge and was expected to make a public announcement within a few days.\n\nInvestigators released a vision video of Tensing, a six-term police superintendent, dragging a handcuffed African American man away from him a week ago in which a man can be seen put his arms on the back of Tensing's cruiser, as he appears to yell at Tensing to stop.\n\nBut prosecutor John Cody, who is handling the case while leaving the case to the police department, said at a press conference on Wednesday that he found that Tensing's account, although questionable in its credibility, was the actual basis of Tensing's probable cause to use deadly force in the 2015 shooting death of Samuel DuBose.\n\nThe second officer called to question Tensing, Timothy Loehmann, has not yet been fired over the incident.\n\nCody said that he would need to review the footage again before making a determination whether to press charges.\n\nCody said the extent of Tensing's actions would be crucial to a legal determination and could indicate whether other law enforcement officers acted more aggressively.\n\nPolice departments around the country are defending police use of force.\n\nWatch footage of the shooting:\n\n\nCody on Tensing's version of events: http://t.co/7ERUvf9q5Y pic.twitter.com/0FGsOkg9l8 \u2014 ABC7 News (@ABC7News) October 17, 2015\n\n'We should be understanding of what a person's physical and mental state is, and the actions of an officer should be judged by those two things,' Cody said. 'The evidence that has surfaced does not show in any way that Michael Tensing behaved in a way that necessarily indicated probable cause, or that he had probable cause to arrest Mr DuBose.'\n\nOne officer, Lt. Michael Kowalski, has been placed on administrative leave while the police department investigates.\n\nCody also hinted that Tensing may be able to successfully appeal the original charge.\n\n'I think what's at issue is the constitutional basis of the charges being brought,' he said. 'If you were able to win a criminal case against a police officer, I think you'd probably win a civil case and I wouldn't necessarily expect such a case to be successful in this case.'\n\nCody said that the disputed claim might have the effect of making it easier for future police use of deadly force. The officers involved in the shooting never faced criminal charges for their actions, but that didn't stop city officials from suspending their membership in the police force.\n\n'It's a very important decision, but that doesn't change the fact that this community is concerned and will continue to be concerned about the actions that I believe the city of Cincinnati has taken,' Cody said.\n\nThe mayor, who went to bat for Tensing's arrest that night, stopped short of saying that he believed the entire legal issue was over, telling reporters, 'Everything is done under the law.'\n\nSen. Nina Turner, who is black, criticized police for declining to charge the officer who fatally shot Sam DuBose last year.\n\n\n'I have raised it repeatedly. I have talked to my constituents. All I heard was that he was a good officer, that he followed our laws, that officers are held to a higher standard; he was never charged with a crime,' Turner said in a statement. 'The cop wasn't even shot.'\n\n\nNumerous black and white police officers have been blacklisted in the past 13 years, including Kowalski, who was suspended for 10 days last year.\n\n'I am deeply concerned that in a time of turmoil, with the end of the summer, like in past years, that Cincinnati Police officers can be accused for using deadly force and not be held accountable,' said Curtis Henderson, the president of the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police, in a statement.\n\n\nCovington, Kentucky: In case of a racially charged shooting, are police not to question the citizens of a community that are divided by race or beliefs, particularly when there is no threat of retaliation from the officers? Covington mayor Shawn Thompson\n\n'Regardless of the allegations or the facts, the fact is this. Officers operate under instructions and sometimes policies that do not take into account the well-being of their communities. When this applies to one group of police officers, it is disturbing and appalling. When the problem is systemic, we all need to work together to face this hard reality.'\n\n\nPolice Commissioner Steve Bailey had no immediate comment on a decision not to charge Kowalski, but said that 'as is, every officer is held to the highest", "topp": "Analysis of Cincinnati shooting's aftermath reveals how multiple officers discussed claim \u2013 disputed as the basis of a murder charge \u2013 that Ray Tensing was 'dragged' by unarmed black man\n\nVIDEO: Cop grabbed Brown by the throat and wrestled him to ground and placed him in a chokehold http://t.co/d2L32CAGhO pic.twitter.com/YI2AzRYFlx \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 25, 2014\n\nAs soon as the hit drizzles over the sidewalk on Sansom Road in the George T.

The officer claimed he was \"dragged\" by DuBose's vehicle following an altercation during a routine traffic stop, and was therefore forced to open fire, shooting DuBose once in the head.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tensing was indicted for murder after Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph Deters said body-camera footage, which he released at a press conference announcing the charge, showed the officer was not dragged during the encounter.\n\n\"It is our belief that he was not dragged.

Recently, we've seen lots of folks embrace the whole T-800 release. The new Task Force 1 did well, while Task Force 2 was received primarily with harsh criticism. The recent introduction of Task Force 3, and the very recent conversion of the Retrofit Hull reinterpretation, are both receiving so much the groundswell of support there seem to be almost no fence to place. Thank you to everyone who has supported our efforts! The spread is encouraging.\n\nI'll take a minute here to take an extended note and let you know what I've seen:\n\nFirst, here's what I think you should not do on TNG episodes \u2013 the Deep Space Nine episodes, the TNG episodes for the best quality remastered movies, your episode notes should not be what you see here:\n\nNote how there are no fields with times or tags, no description/slug/squad name, no table of contents, no notes or keywords on the posts. This is getting bizarrely insular and schismatic, and it's getting to me. It's as if this site were itself stuck on DS9. Maybe this is all due to an internal struggle. Maybe they're making them new TNG episodes.\n\nSecond, for some reason the blog doesn't want you to interact with its co-creators. However, please let us know if you're seeing an error here when you look at a comment in which TNG identifies the writer of the post or the author of the video accompanying the post, or even when you click the gallery. It's got to be:\n\nI think this might be the first time a staff member has allowed its output directly to the public. The usual format is: TNG Director's Cut (for S1), or whatever S1 episode the panelist's exclusive to, but here, I'm seeing one guy say that TNG Director's Cut of Deep Space Nine Season 1 \"doesn't really fit with the rest of the series\" while the screenwriter (in a tiny white t-shirt) explains the genesis of that podcast and its contribution. The SLS is the opposite, maybe a more repertory, which leads me to believe that that seems to be the idea behind this creation, and that's really weird. I'm sorry about that!\n\nAlso, while I'd expect a very few commenters to pick up on the big explanation of how to click things like Task Force 3 there, my opinion is that you can look at the aforementioned episodes and base your opinion off it alone \u2013 no way on earth is it \"work of the creatives\" or anything. The original purpose of the blog was for content that could be made freely available to the public by the artists participating, just like this site. I'm not saying this to say they're good, but the point is to empower users' creative works to live on elsewhere and if you don't think that they're making great, but a problem, for some reason you think it's an entitlement, then you seem to have a totally unqualified opinion! There's no way to go this far off on your own and not write bad things on a blog.\n\nBut it's hard not to notice what this site lacks in the process of posting and the flaws of the design and layout, especially on occasion where you notice the improvements like in the two recent additions. It seems like a struggle to identify a real issue with the new approach and to actually make the effort to engage and engage with this staff of artists, which is one of the great things about the internet and of forums. This is still a huge website.\n\nWhen you post and enjoy doing so, and maintain a forum forum for discussion and improvement, you're sharing in something fantastic. You're not just enabling it.\n\nIf you're working on making your content available on all manner of platforms and content providers, but for some reason can't get a handle on how to properly do that right, go after what you think makes this the best platform. And the people you do engage with in this space tend to be your main audience and this is where I think you can really get it right.\n\nAm I overreacting to a lack of Facebook and Twitter interaction? Not at all. Although I understand people really should use social media more and view the effectiveness of that as a more objective measure of popularity and value, there are some that don't care to engage. They just want to get their hands on the content and if you're the right one they'll go straight to it.\n\nWe can use more organizations that actively and enthusiastically go after this type of work.

I've had greater success with runs set up privately through Redditchat or the various DPS channels \u2013 but at the same time, I've also watched Elites fail in the first 30 seconds with a highly-skilled team, just because someone pushed a Battleship to close to the Starbase with a mistimed tractor beam repulsor.\n\nOne last point before the briefing: these techniques represent the efforts of many players, and while they worked for us, they may not be the only way to beat this STF. If you've come across other methods, don't hesitate to share them in the comments below.\n\nMission Brief: The Tzenkethi Front\n\nRegardless of the difficulty (normal, advanced and elite), the mission parameters remain essentially the same. A Tzenkethi invasion force has moved five small staging bases into the Eta Serpentis system, and are launching waves of attacks against the planet's defences (Klingon Starbase).\n\nYour goal is to intercept the Tzenkethi Battleships \u2013 marked by the Protomatter Bomb warning sign on your main viewscreen. In the process of destroying the battleship, you recover the Protomatter Bomb and then use it against one of the five Tzenkethi staging bases.\n\nThe STF comes with voice prompts and reminders, letting you know when a player has picked up the bomb, and when a base is destroyed. When you pick up the bomb, your ship will be given a visual cue identifying that you have the bomb. If you are destroyed, the protomatter bomb you carry is destroyed with you.\n\nThe Football (Protomatter Bomb)\n\nWhile in Tzenkethi hands, the protomatter bombs are targeted at your station. They can be deployed fairly close to the station, and the bomb itself cannot be intercepted by weapons or space magic. At about a 2km range, a Battleship can easily deploy the device and hit your station. (It's instantaneous) For Normal and Advanced runs, the optional objective is to prevent damage to the station for additional marks. For Elite runs, failure to stop this attack on your station is an auto failure.\n\nWhen the football is in a players hands, your ship becomes impacted by the bizarre effects of protomatter. The first thing you will notice is that your ship is unable to go to full impulse, and you appear to be covered in a type of exotic radiation. This becomes problematic as you try to get to the Tzenkethi bases quickly.\n\nWarning: If you use a teleport ability like Trajector Jump you will drop the bomb and a Tzenkethi group will immediately warp in and claim the bomb. (TY ElectrumLeopard)\n\nAdditionally \u2013 if you carry the bomb with a Romulan ship, do not use the singularity jump or you will lose the bomb; same thing with the singularity shadows. (TY Nandos)\n\nSome players will experience a visual glitch in that the bomb may appear to 'drop' along the way. This appears to be a coding problem in the game, or if you prefer, a false image caused by temporal distortion (a QA happy accident). As long as you have the main marker showing you have the bomb, it will not release until you are in range when you are offered an interaction button to drop the bomb. Deploying the bomb takes a short amount of time, and if you're taking damage, the bomb will not drop. A second visual glitch appears to happen when you switch alts and make multiple runs \u2013 occasionally the bomb identification will not show. There is no easy fix other than restarting the game after you complete the mission.\n\nThe Tzenkethi\n\nThe Tzenkethi battle groups operate in waves. You will encounter groups of frigates on an ongoing basis, while the bomb groups consisting of a battleship, and a cruiser to provide support.

{"eta": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago mother thought she knew when it was safe to take her children outside, that she could protect them by sizing up and avoiding the city's gang violence.\n\nBut when police and workers broke through a locked gate on a desolate field off Chicago's south side in March, LaVoyann Williams thought she was being drugged.\n\nWilliams grew up in West Chicago and is now the main caregiver for her mother, Lacey Canty-Williams, 49, and four of her sons. They both have struggled for years with health problems that their mother had struggled to get proper treatment for for decades.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Williams said Canty-Williams was thrown into the hospital on the day of the beating. Authorities say Canty-Williams suffered internal bleeding and was denied oxygen.\n\n\"I thought that was normal,\" Williams said from her home in the city's South Side neighborhood where crime rates have plummeted but poverty remains a problem.\n\n\"But I saw the body, the people and the streets. I didn't believe that wasn't normal as a mother.\"\n\nCanty-Williams was hospitalized for two weeks before the Chicago police and state's attorney's offices were able to secure a death certificate, according to court records and a police department official.\n\nPolice say 18-year-old Jamar Williams was the driver, armed with a gun. Four others \u2014 18-year-old Asad Meisha Hawkins and 17-year-old Akeem Woods, both of Chicago; 20-year-old Steven Jones, of Chicago; 19-year-old Eddie Williams, of Chicago \u2014 as well as 19-year-old Adario Hernandez, of Chicago, all face charges. None are in custody. Authorities are still investigating the incident and no cause has been determined.\n\nCanty-Williams' younger son, Jalen, said the abuse at the hands of gangsters began as early as about age 6.\n\n\"Everywhere I go my head hurts,\" said Jalen Williams, sitting on the front steps of his parents' home. \"Canty. She's not here anymore.\"\n\nHis mother was a strong independent woman who struggled with drug addiction, which she often prescribed to herself, Jalen Williams said. She suffered a stroke three years ago and lost her good grasp of things.\n\nBut when her son was 2, \"that mom said, 'I have too much faith. I'm gonna take the knife to my throat if you don't give me everything I want,'\" he said.\n\nWilliams said she began taking pills, which they called \"pill pills.\" At first, she said she believed it was the work of a mysterious doctor at her clinic. But then she found their strong odor on her breath.\n\n\"When you make a deal with the devil, sometimes he gives you what you want right where you need it,\" she said, pointing to the doctor's letter, which read, \"this drug is very good, it provides tremendous relief and it is painless.\"\n\nCanty-Williams often prescribed the pills to her other sons, Jalen said. She admitted that she began to abuse methamphetamines, which is a class of drugs that includes heroin. But she denied that her younger sons were involved.\n\nJalen said what shocked him was not that he knew drugs were important, but that he couldn't break free.\n\nThe teen said his mother once had him throwing up near a dumpster, and it took many of her tests for his cholesterol and blood pressure to drop within acceptable limits. But he became even more upset to hear how Canty-Williams had died.\n\n\"She was a wonderful mom, but I was hurt,\" he said. \"I didn't know she was going to end her life like that.\"\n\nAfter Canty-Williams, whom he married in 2004, gave birth to her fifth son in 2010, Williams said she began having problems with drug and alcohol abuse. She once quit taking her pills, which were prescribed to her for bladder infections, because she suspected the pills were laced with something called low-dose carbon monoxide, or LDX. That's because the pills did not mask the smell of her urine.\n\nJalen said his sister lives with two elderly people.\n\n\"We always joke about having two kids and my mom not being around,\" he said.\n\nHe spoke with her about the death, but she only smiled.\n\n\"I wanted to bring her home with me but not like this,\" Jalen said.\n\nCanty-Williams died at a local hospital, where she was taken by ambulance, said Mark Hempel, the chief of internal medicine for Chicago Public Health. Police found her body when they smashed the gate at her property, Hempel said. It took officers several hours to free her from the gate, which they used to keep off the street.\n\nAfter she", "topp": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago mother thought she knew when it was safe to take her children outside, that she could protect them by sizing up and avoiding the potential dangers of getting into a car.\n\nBut that sort of fear does not always stay with a person, Donald Jackson says.\n\nJackson took his 1-year-old son to an Illinois convention for aspiring TV and film actors in the early evening on Thursday.

It fractured the boy's jaw and shattered some teeth before it went out his other cheek, all while he held his mother's hand.\n\n\"He was with his mother, and it wasn't like I was doing something wrong, having him out after hours,\" said Brashear, a 21-year-old single mother of two, referring to the shooting that happened before sundown June 28 on Chicago's South Side. \"I thought he was safe.\"\n\nKavan is part of a growing roster of children who have been shot in the city this year amid a spike in killings and shootings. More than 330 killings have occurred in the city.\n\nSo far, no child has died from the gunfire that's often connected to gangs. Children have been struck while doing normal kid things like playing with sparklers, drawing on the sidewalk or holding a mother's hand.\n\nStatistics that The Associated Press requested from the Police Department show children ages 10 to 17, who make up more than 260 of the victims so far this year, are at greater risk than those younger than 10. But police records through the end of June showed 15 children younger than 10 had been shot, which is seven more young shooting victims than the same span last year.\n\nFour more young children have been shot since the start of July, including a 6-year-old girl who was sitting on a porch Tuesday with her mother and grandmother when a bullet \u2014 one of more than 40 fired a block away \u2014 struck her in the stomach.\n\nPolice are trying to determine if the gunfire that struck Tacarra Morgan in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side was an exchange between people inside a caravan of cars and a group of men on the street. They say another possibility is that someone in one of the vehicles sprayed the area with a high-capacity assault weapon.\n\nTacarra's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, a hospital official said Wednesday.\n\nThe shootings, mostly in neighborhoods on the South and West sides, underline what the residents already knew: It's a dangerous time for the city's children as well.\n\nBut since the recent shootings of young victims haven't been deadly, they have received little attention outside Chicago. The children haven't become national symbols of the city's violence like 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, who was lured into an alley last November with the promise of a juice box and shot to death, allegedly by gang members out to punish his father.\n\nOther children besides Kavan have been struck by gunfire while doing nothing other than being kids, leaving their families to wonder if there's anything they can do to protect them. The victims include:\n\n\u2014 Six-year-old Jaylene Bermeo, who was drawing with sidewalk chalk on the evening of June 6 in the Logan Square neighborhood on the city's northwest side when she was shot in the back. The bullet punctured her lung and lodged near her heart. Police say a 17-year-old boy accidentally shot the girl when he opened fire on rival gang members as he drove down the block.\n\n\u2014 Three-year-old Devon Quinn, who was with his dad on Father's Day in a car in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side when someone pulled up and fired at least 10 shots at the vehicle. Prosecutors say the gunman was a gang member who opened fire in a rival gang's territory to pay tribute to a dead member of his own gang. At a court hearing, prosecutors said the boy was left paralyzed from the chest down and that he will never be able to move his limbs or even breathe on his own.\n\n\u2014 Five-year-old Taniyah Williams and her 8-year-old cousin, Corey Bondurant, who were playing with sparklers on the evening of July 4 in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side when someone sprayed the area with bullets. Taniyah was struck in the leg, as were a 19-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man. After the commotion, relatives discovered that 8-year-old Corey was also shot in the leg.\n\nSince her son Kavan was wounded, Brashear struggles with how to talk to him about the shooting, even as she continues taking him to doctor appointments and trying to determine what can be done about his facial scars.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it to him,\" she said of the boy who has been afraid to fall asleep since the incident and experiences nightmares when he does. \"How do you tell a kid, 'Oh, you got shot", "eta_suffix": " died at a local hospital, where she was taken by ambulance, said Mark Hempel, the chief of internal medicine for Chicago Public Health.

{"eta": "6/16/2014 \u2013 by James Fedewa\n\n\nI moved to Pacific Beach in San Diego about 2 months before I turned 21 years old (April 1993). My parents paid for a house near the beach, and for 4-5 months during spring break, for my sister to live with me for a week, a young guy named Benita was living in the house too. We were always together. It's not easy to move from your parents' house to their in a week, but we had the time. For that matter, this was a good time to make new friends. I had moved to the city, and was also visiting my friend Christina, and thought I might get in touch with her.\n\nBenita was very friendly and sociable, and we spent a lot of time together. While there were no specific problems, Benita seemed to keep worrying about her, and for a while I suggested she get back with her boyfriend, whom she worked with, about something she had said a couple months prior. But when we were leaving, she told me directly, \"If only you would leave, I would be ready. I would be completely ready for him. I understand you would have been happy living with me.\"\n\nThat night I told Benita what she had just said. The next morning she said, \"Yeah, if that's it really, I would rather get out of the house, and be alone, just like you suggested. But even though that would make me happy, I think I still want to stay with you.\"\n\nI asked about being single again. She admitted to having been planning all along to get married. She said it was an option for her, and she understood. That night we talked a little more, and then I decided that it was time that I broke us up.\n\nWhat is going on now? I always wanted to be with a long-term partner. Not Benita. I didn't think she really was willing to stay with me without a \"partner.\" There was a lot of things that I didn't like about Benita (lack of discipline, becoming apart of my social circle), and I was scared she would get hurt because of these things. It was a very confusing time, and I am deeply grateful that I have a much better understanding of our relationships now, since they have been further severed. I have even learned to value the person I have left, but that doesn't mean she was ever not welcome within my circle. As for the past, I feel sad that I wasted so much of my youth trying to get together with her. It is very hard and I didn't do a good job at growing up. However, I have hope that there will be more years to come where I want to be involved romantically, and with someone.\n\nI still have a heart for Benita. I got some pictures taken. It's almost time to move back to my home in San Diego, and I have everything in place for it. It was definitely difficult, having been so na\u00efve, but I am now back. There are still a lot of hard feelings in our relationship, but for now I will focus on getting over them. As for Benita, the money she made through her work meant that I hardly got any pay. She did better at her job, but I always felt like she was getting pretty good help from her. There are things we never spoke about, like college tuition and having to pay for the car I had just gotten. When we had that discussion, Benita sat back and relaxed for a moment. Maybe someday we will talk more about what it was like for me, and how I can make it better for her. For now, it is enough to move on with our lives.\n\n\u2013 by Deb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nAlana is a long-time marine biologist who lives in Honolulu, Hawaii.

My initial San Diego experience was at a very impressionable time in my life.\n\n\nI only \"liked\" professional baseball and football, but the San Diego community (and local teams) only enhanced that \"like\" and grew it into a love. I quickly grew into a diehard San Diego Padres (and Chargers) fan and I have been a fanatic of those two teams for the last 22 years. Tony Gwynn was the superstar for the Padres and he became my favorite baseball player the more and more I watched and listen to him.\n\n\nLiving in San Diego, I went to as many baseball games as I could. Back in my early twenties, the Padres played at Jack Murphy Stadium, and the cheap tickets in right field were only $7 (back when baseball was considered the affordable sport), so we went to a lot of games. The best games were the Dodger/Padres of course, and Tony Gwynn always showed up and played great. Back then the Padres and Tony Gwynn were known as The Dodger Killers, as they always managed to beat their biggest rival L.A (the Giants on the other hand were quite opposite). It was Tony Gwynn's team for 20 years and San Diegans loved their perennial all-star. No matter how terrible the Padres were, San Diego always had Tony Gwynn\u2026\n\n\nIn the 2001 season, the last season of Gwynn's career, was my most remembered of him. How he lasted on the same team his whole career made me admire him more, as he taught sacrifice. Tony did not start that season, as he had a knee injury and he was primarily used as a pinch-hitter. Most Padres fans knew it was going to be Gwynn's final season, and since he did not start that season, it made attending every game even more important (just so you can get that final glimpse of the Mr. San Diego legend). As most pinch-hitters are used, in the latter innings of close games, fans would be anxious (at a warm idle) in hope the Padres could get a runner in scoring position, then Padres fans could \"possibly\" see Tony Gwynn come in for a pinch-hit. I got to see one of those close games, might have been his last too, and Tony hit a pinch hit single, drove in the winning run and the crowd went haywire.\n\n\nI think the older we get, the more emotional we get, or we can actually recognize what we can lose even more (especially when we can relate our own experiences with those reminders of our past). The story of my favorite baseball player had so many chapters of Tony Gwynn's 20 year career, with each year (or Chapter) being so different. From a young kid and growing into the man I am today, I can feel and empathize what Tony Gwynn did then, and related it to me, and what I was doing then. Being just a fan of a guy lets me combine his career and achievements, to where I've been in my own life.\n\n\nI was always a fan of Tony Gwynn (the player, the person, the coach and the broadcaster). These \"links\" of history that we tie with the players we admire the most helps us look at ourselves (by reminding us of our own past and where we are now). I was only a fan of Tony Gwynn and I never met him, but he was Mr. San Diego and everyone in San Diego (and beyond) loved him. The moments of Tony Gwynn's career are joined and bonded together through my life, as well as other fans across the globe. Remembering what he did makes me think of where I was, when he did it. When I was 20, 30 and 40 years old, Tony Gwynn's career accomplishments remind me of several moment of my own life. When Tony Gwynn spoke, people were drawn to him.

{"eta": "Before we get into the deliciousness above, let me thank you all for making this year's NEDA week post\u2014sharing your ED story with a partner or friend\u2014so enjoyable this year. Now, let's begin.\n\nApplying to graduate school and applying to doctoral programs tend to be fairly involved and expensive processes. If you can save 10 minutes every day by following this guide, you're making that time worthwhile. I suppose you could get really nice at saving a paragraph per week. You'll appreciate it.\n\nBefore I go more into the steps, I have a quick disclaimer for those who have applied to or completed doctoral programs and are planning to do doctoral graduate work elsewhere in their lives. I absolutely understand why you'd want to complete your schoolwork while you're still in school. Please be careful when doing your doctoral work, doing something that is happening when you are busy in your day-to-day life, or doing something that may put you in front of an official institution.\n\nTherefore, this advice applies to you if you are a person in graduate school pursuing a Ph.D. and/or pursuing a doctorate. If you've never been a part of a program, this advice likely won't apply to you. While we're on the subject of Ph.D.'s, let me explain why it makes sense for someone to pursue a doctorate regardless of where they are in their career journey.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's jump into some of the details.\n\nPlanning a Doctorate Program: What Should I Know?\n\nI am the entry-level student within the course to be accepted into the program that is my dissertation adviser. My doctoral thesis advisor is the professor whom we will be working under for the first three years in graduate school.\n\nI am accepting personal employment, which means that I will need to sign employment contracts for some weeks during graduate school. This is voluntary, and I recommend doing it early. You will incur some paperwork costs that you'll be responsible for paying for for work up to a year after graduation. You have until the end of February of your first year, and the third year is in summer. You will then be covered under the Graduate Student Life contract, which will require you to continue receiving health insurance.\n\nDuring graduate school, you will be required to publish your work and get publication credits every three years. I will write blog posts about my dissertation work throughout the year. If you are interested in blogging about or teaching my work, my current account on Twitter is @KnolSalute. I recommend @GraduateSalute to help you keep up with the latest news.\n\nAll Graduate Students: What To Expect\n\nIt all begins\u2026when we apply online\u2026around February 8th [this week, Feb. 8th. So there you go].\n\nThere are two ways to apply to graduate school and gain admission to the university that I'm going to be attending soon. We will be applying through the Department of Education's online application system which will take about three months from today, February 8th.\n\nThere is a lot of information, so here's what to expect when you submit your application\u2026\n\nDear Neena,\n\nI am pleased to inform you that you were chosen for the \"Graduate Studies Postdoc Program\" to join the university of South Carolina, so you are now eligible to apply for a program here. The title of the postdoc is \"Post doc and Interim Postdoc,\" and the duties include studies under a professor, organizing for research, writing papers to be presented, conducting research, teaching courses to graduate students (both undergraduate and graduate students), collecting and analyzing data to be submitted to the study, and coordinating with the Department of Health and Human Services for the development of a comprehensive disability education services program. The current graduate intake statistics show that there are 1,244 graduate students across the U.S. and over 33,000 in graduate programs across the country.\n\nIf you would like more information, please refer to your application. Please be sure to use a similar name for your application (see example below).\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Weiz\n\nDr. Paul Weiz\n\nDoctoral Student\n\nAdmission Decision for Graduate Students\n\nDavid Whittaker\n\nDirector, Career Services\n\nDepartment of Education\n\nUniversity of South Carolina at Charleston\n\nDear Dr. Whittaker,\n\nThank you for your email about applying to graduate school. I am currently applying for the doctoral candidate-level graduate, postdoctoral graduate, and postdoctoral postdoctoral doctoral programs. The State of South Carolina determines the criteria with all applicants and the grant preparation program. While I follow the educational requirements of the state (M.S. in Business Administration (BEA), M.A. in Government-Industry Relations (GE-IGNR), and B.S. in Culinary Sciences", "topp": "Before we get into the deliciousness above, let me thank you all for making this year's NEDA week post\u2014sharing your ED story with a partner or friend\u2014a potentially lifesaving one. It's not always easy to share your story, and we'd like to use you as the inspiration for others so that we can all understand what that actually means.\n\nThis week I'll be sharing with you three uses I've found for that post one of the most common ones here and on the ED forum, ED Dramas. You can access this resource from our ED Dramas Public Forum which I'm currently leading. The ED Part of the blog wants the information to be available as well. There are two things the Board will generally be interested in:\n\nWhat do you do with your ED Dramas? How do you deal with your own recovery?\n\n\n(with Michelle)\n\nCaroline: You're welcome! It's a shame it's rather difficult to make an easy dependency break when things are going according to plan but there's no excuse for doing it the other way around.\n\nI certainly like the idea that an ED Domination Epilogue is an accomplished part of your transformation and the ending of your story. That said, I can't imagine it was interesting or rewarding when it happened but it certainly deserves a deep, abiding appreciation and enjoyment. I especially love the voice-over of your weakness (super loathed) climax!\n\nThe most honest way I can put it is like a little love letter, a promise to yourself that you'll always come back from your ED with more stronger understanding of yourself, and possibly stronger desires. It could also be a call to someone you've only just met who offers some advice.\n\nAs for reliance of your story on for one of my favorite things, my wife certainly gets excited about stories and entreats me to share the first shot from The Best Part of ED (Vancouver, BC, and Toronto, Canada) with her in another thread.\n\nI'll admit it: I just sort of put it down there and didn't get the full picture at first! But now I'm swooning and I just need to get on sharing!\n\nTerry: This is actually what we call an E.T.-ish E-Movies. Far easier to examine through the lens of Com.sci.society than E.D.P.E.M.E. or E.D.F.M.E. (The Disciplineers of Sexual Exploitation, nnnnnn.nn) and especially offers a gentle subtext about where you hit in your natural journey as a human being and the challenges of your addiction. So do we really care if people are aware of these movies and hear about their origins? I think not. But I never brought it up to Michelle after L.A. (where we also did P.S. I was in 6/2010 with an Asian AnnaChin. \u2026she was awesome), and honestly, I can't imagine that many folks would be interested in seeing these films themselves. If we decided to discuss it further, I think that they probably would be confused by the subject matter. Having said that, I'm also willing to voice my skepticism, except in the months leading up to my ED for my first movie shoot (where the whole Hollywood/ED story was propagated across social media from every angle), I think it was certainly pretty informative and fine for everyone (including the kids whose parents were happy to pump the tires). The more I heard about it, the more I felt that I would read each one and be told it was all I needed to know about myself. The downside is that these films, even if edited somewhat, are seriously old and a little tired and airbrushed and over-baked. To that end, I was still able to inject a little nastiness here and there but loved every minute of the experience and wanted to share it with the past and future addicts.\n\nPedro: I've recently seen two other \"Et Are\" movies and while the first was an accurate portrayal of addiction, the second isn't. \"Et Are: The Movie\" is just a story about two \"inverts\" in search of a Sassy Little Fix. The \"movie\" itself isn't the trick but something true and authoritative and for those from other countries, just like how a book is just an entity that was written and created. Those are just fiction. Two men who didn't have sex before but adored it realized that the greatest power of love is the power to find yourself.\n\nCara: Here's my favourite thing to do with my \"epilogue\" so far:\n\n10 years after \"illness began,\" I joined a chapter of the Richmond Mind Crew at Imperial College in Toronto. They are more of the policy heavy complex-think and program people than of leaders but we all did a lot of things that we now", "human": "Before we get into the deliciousness above, let me thank you all for making this year's NEDA week post\u2014sharing your ED story with a partner or friend\u2014so lovely. I appreciated all of the comments, especially those from people who are just on the brink of sharing with their partners. I hope you all find strength and support in the CR community! NEDA week is still up and running, so please keep these issues fresh in your minds. And, fellow bloggers, let me know if you write NEDA posts of your own!\n\nI don't think I have to say too much about the deliciousness above. Guacamole. Sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes grilled with a spice rub. What more could one ask for, except seconds and thirds? Seriously, sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods: they're one of the more healthy and natural ways to get your carb attack on, and their sweetness gives them tremendous versatility. They're standard dinner fare for me, but I can easily eat them for breakfast, as we all just learned when I posted my sweet potato breakfast salad with almond butter protein dressing:\n\nToday's recipe is quick and easy, but it's also an impressive appetizer dish to share at parties or as a first course for dinner at home. I grilled my sweet potato rounds on my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddle (this year's holiday request), but baking them will work every bit as nicely. And of course, if you have an outdoor grill, have at it. Grilling sweet potatoes brings out their caramel flavors, and it's a great opportunity to crack out a spicy, smoky mixture of seasonings.\n\nChili-Rubbed Sweet Potato Rounds with Guacamole (vegan, gluten free, soy free)\n\nServes 4\n\nFor the chili spice rub:\n\n2 tbsps chili powder\n\n1 tsp paprika (I use regular here, but use smoked paprika if you want a smoky flavor!)\n\n1 tsp coriander\n\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\n1/2 tsp sea salt\n\nDash cayenne pepper (omit if you don't want the heat)\n\nFor the dish:\n\n1 large sweet potato, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds\n\nCoconut oil (optional)\n\n1 recipe classic Choosing Raw guacamole\n\n1) If you're baking your sweet 'taters, pre-heat oven to 425 degrees. If you're grilling them, first prepare a pot of boiling water with a steamer insert.\n\n2) Mix spices together for the rub.\n\n3) Oven method: Brush or spray potatoes lightly with coconut oil (you can omit this if you're avoiding oils). Sprinkle them with the spice rub. Roast round for about 12-15 minutes, or until golden on the bottoms. Flip and roast for another 12-15 minutes.\n\nGrill method: Steam sweet potato rounds for about eight minutes\u2013you don't want them cooked through, but you do want them to be most of the way there. Remove from steam heat, spray or brush lightly with coconut oil (totally optional), dust with chili rub, and transfer to grill. Grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.\n\n4) Whip up a batch of classic CR guacamole. Transfer it to a plastic bag, and snip one corner of the bag so that you can pipe out the guac (I almost wrote \"pipette out\" the guac\u2013too much biochem lab).\n\nPipe the guac onto the rounds as if you were frosting cupcakes. (NB: My guac didn't look much better after piping than it might have if I'd used a spoon. So this step, while nice, is definitely optional).\n\n5) Serve, savor, swoon.\n\nThe light, bright, lemony guacamole pairs perfectly with the dense, sweet, and smoky sweet potatoes in this scrumptious recipe. Added bonus? Lots of complex carbs and healthy fat make this an incredibly satiating\u2014as well as a supremely delicious\u2014snack or appetizer.\n\nHealthy, simple, and satisfying. The best kind of party food.\n\nHope you keep this recipe in mind for either winter or summer entertaining; one of its benefits is that it features produce from both seasons, and it's very versatile!\n\nWith that, it's back to a long day of biochem lab and Orgo reports.

{"eta": "This event occurred to me at least twelve years ago, and I still don't know what happened.\n\nDriving home from a Friday night shift at the newspaper, my wife wanted to buy a book, and took me with her to purchase the same title. However, when we pulled up to the bookstore, she noticed that the shopping cart was empty. She showed me her two pounds of books. I followed her in our car to a particular shelf, and we sat a moment and watched as she read them.\n\nAt that time, I was 22 years of age, but for some reason, I felt like I was watching her read while watching her walk to the shelf to bring them in the car. That night, I asked myself the most simple of questions, and asked again the same question, and again, and again. The same question that had me curiously staring at my wife for an entire night. Who are these books? What is the relationship between them? What happened? This past Sunday, I received the following email from Professor Marcus:\n\nWe have a power outage in the northern part of our data center. So while I and the a/v team had power for a brief period of time, most of the data wasn't going to the datacenter at all, so we were left holding the bag. I talked to Keith and Josh, our datacenter coordinator, and they said that we may be able to get these books from some sort of \"farm\" warehouse. Let me stress that it was a strange argumentation, since we hadn't met either of these guys before. Well, they told us about this farm, and we were asked if we were interested. Well, we agreed, because apparently everything is going through the Kiva Network (https://kiva.org/homes for storage on Kiva), which is just as well. It also seems to me that much of what we're doing this weekend we didn't need to do any of.\n\nAnyhow, some time in the past couple of weeks, we got some home shipping boxes from a local shop which are a mix of we were still trying to find Kiva Containers (these are really cool for that reason) and additional stuff (like supplies for setting things on fire, or, well, everything). What we ended up with were 3 containers which I estimate to hold about 1600 to 2000 books. And of course, we get them from people who then ship the books around to other people using their data centers (some with a certain design), without any sort of restrictions beyond maybe a 5 item limit per post in my mailbox (some of which I actually collect). All of the books are pretty much the same books I had before, but I think that a couple of these guys need to add some explanatory text to their books, and perhaps publish them on that site for people to download and read, or sell for other purposes.\n\nSo, I found a few potential deals on a Kickstarter page, and had them sell them for about $500, mostly for books related to this recent University research finding. For now, only 100 or so have been ordered (about a thousand remain at press time), but someone is shooting for 500 in the next 24 hours. And what, they might want to keep some for themselves?\n\nWell, we already knew that we don't get a lot of spare books for general distribution, so I said to Keith or Josh over the phone, we need to get some other people started here to have a supply of this, and see if people want them. We thought that perhaps they could see how the books are used, and at the very least try to find a profit out of it. As someone who knows data science and having a connection with some people who understand kiva, I like to do that kind of research, or at least know what to expect in a loan. In any case, they also sent me a bunch of documentation on how the book goes from data center to homes, and I really enjoyed it. They even looked at some aspects of pricing their service, and found that the \"anywhere in town\" price worked pretty well for them. I suppose the thought is that you don't want to sell more books for less. If the word is out that it's now available anywhere in town, then maybe you can get the cost of each book higher? Since the book is presented as a service for those who want to make a profit (out of a limited pool), it makes sense to charge the people who want to buy it something. So we gave the deal a couple of weeks to sell out.\n\nAfter giving a bunch of talks, and getting some press exposure for the project, the Kickstarter was actually able to add $200 to our total. Of course, most press runs on this blog normally involve looking at trends, stats, and reports, but it's more fun to go after \"people,\" you know? We also noticed that folks from other universities bought the books, plus the fact", "topp": "This event occurred to me at least twelve years ago, and I still don't know what happened.\n\nDriving home from a Friday night shift at the newspaper, my mind wandered down the desolate stretch of road through Antioch. There's no question about the cold weather that greeted me then. It was still going strong when I saw the radiator behind some parked cars, and before long the radiator was the only thing parked on the ground.\n\nNothing feels the cold better than the smell of the grime. I got my heater button-holed. Whoever this person was, if they were actually, aren't holding it too close, because there is nothing in their hair, only a clean strand of brown hair flowing to, and away from, their upper lip. It must have been a solemn, prolonged labor of love, helping out.\n\nIt is cold.\n\nWhatever their \"emotions\" were behind their beard and shaved head, they stayed cold.\n\nAfter a year of living in eastern Washington, I learned in 2007 that girls with facial hair are far more likely to present to drug and prostitution rehab centers during the last year. I assumed this was for natural reasons.\n\nEmotions-wise, however, it seems more an unhappy surprise that another girl with a beard and spiky haircut showed up at the center's detox treatment center. When I returned to my car with my heater cranked up with the auxiliary vehicle, I almost couldn't bring myself to watch her!\n\nI just couldn't bring myself to look at her.\n\nIt was funny, but for the other girls there, she was not so amusing. I watched as she came past, exiting the vehicle in a huff, pointing frantically at me and explaining that \"I've left my hat and jacket behind at the yard.\" There was no hint of remorse on her face.\n\nHer cheeks had been so red they almost looked like a rash. The hair down her back had disappeared into strands, the tint of her lipstick was a bit too yellow, and she had dark circles under her eyes from her recent procedure. Her brows were hisky-jerky, like she didn't know where her eyes had been placed.\n\nBut what really boggled my mind was the saddest part of it all.\n\nAnd that story can, sadly, also happen to anyone. I have all of these eye-witness accounts of sex, all of these phone calls of late at night to Women for Marijuana's hotline\u2013\u2014the number can be different, but it all seems the same.\n\nListening to their excuses and explaining why they are just coming up, where they thought they were going, but didn't\u2013no matter how strong their story is\u2013made me laugh. I mean really laugh. That's not of the mirth-pearls variety. That's a laugh that will make you think about the fact that you actually weren't going anywhere at all. It's a laugh that you'll shout from your windshield every time you drive in a car, or you'll take on a lover and shout \"LOL!\"\n\nMaybe it was the smell of her. It must have been her clothes. They all were fuzzy and silky-smooth, a part of her body unlike anything else I've ever seen. And anyway, this is Seattle, where people dress in thongs and they've been known to sell munchies at a strip club. I wonder if it was the spill of extra virgin olive oil on her neck, the makeup that looks like a bad abrasion from laying down on the interstate, or the fact that she was rubbing one of her wrists against a red tile that just came in last, cracked.\n\nI laugh anyway\u2013lunge into the car to unplug and make my excuses\u2013I feel the time flying by. And suddenly this chill sensation hits my chest and sets my body on fire.\n\nFor weeks, I have enjoyed holding my forehead as I try to comprehend this, that and the other, happening to all of these girls, and it's made me realize how little I know about women of substance. This know-it-all attitude I've used to sit to laws and regulations about the men and women of our community.\n\nAnd for weeks, I've held back from speaking up, because I've been afraid I might make a fool of myself. It didn't matter what I was afraid of.\n\nBut now I feel nothing but gratitude and understand how strong women are when they use drugs. I felt that intense sense of gratitude last year, watching that toddler turn that ratchet bellow-blast of anger into something a little more considering, and as she put her ironing cloth aside and let herself breath, I thought \"you know, maybe these pit bull types who think it's a joke to let younger girls hang out with them and not lock the damn keys down.\"\n\nWe don't know what these victims think of us\u2014we can", "human": "This event occurred to me at least twelve years ago, and I still don't know what happened.\n\nDriving home from a Friday night shift at the newspaper, my car's cruise control set on 55 mph, I drove by a road sign I've driven by hundreds of times. It reads, \"Orrick: 5 Miles.\" Just as I went by, the Rolling Stones \"Gimme Shelter\" came on the radio.\n\nPerfect. I lived in Orrick, Missouri, at the time, and \"Gimme Shelter\" was not only my favorite Rolling Stones tune, it was also four minutes, thirty-seven seconds long, which would last me all the way home.\n\nThen my drive fell out of reality.\n\nA pull on the car engine snapped me out of the road hypnosis that had overtaken me. It took me a few seconds to realize that pull was the cruise control trying to keep the speed steady up a hill. The trouble was there were no hills between that road sign and my turnoff. Looking out the window didn't help; a thick fog had enveloped the car and I could barely see the dotted line on the road. I slowed the car and drove up two more hills before I saw a light piercing through the fog.\n\nTurning onto a gravel road toward the light, I found myself in the parking lot of a Jehovah's Witness church and knew where I was \u2013 five miles on the other side of my turnoff. As I sat in the parking lot, my car in park, trying to figure out how I missed the exit, I heard something I couldn't believe. \"Gimme Shelter\" still played on the radio. It continued to play for another minute and a half.\n\nAfter I calmed a bit, I put the car in gear, pulled back onto the highway and went home. The fog quickly dissipated. I'd driven ten miles in three minutes at 55 mph. That wasn't possible. What happened to me?\n\nCases of missing time and distance are as common as they are confusing. The Internet is littered with tales of travelers entering a fog only to discover they're suddenly 300 miles away from home, or they've gone nowhere, but it's inexplicably hours later. Explanations range from time slips, to dimensional slips, to alien abduction. Whatever the case, Brandon White of Maryville, Missouri, has experienced missing time and distance; more than once. \"The first time I was about ten and I was walking out in the front yard,\" White said. It was just after lunch.\n\nAs White went toward a thick ring of pine trees that surrounded his family's farmhouse, he saw something floating on the other side of the tree line. \"It was pale, sort of translucent,\" he said. \"It was passing between our house and the neighbor's house. I thought it was a blimp.\"\n\nHis afternoon suddenly disappeared. \"The next thing I remember was coming in for dinner; 5 or 5:30,\" he said. \"I didn't think about it at the time. As a kid, time was nothing.\"\n\nBut five hours of his life were just gone.\n\nIn his teens, his life got stranger. \"At 13 or 14 I stopped sleeping. I was deathly afraid of sleep,\" he said. \"I would fall to sleep, get into an REM sleep, and start screaming. I would wake up in strange places. In the yard, on the porch, upside down hanging from my bunk bed.\" White said he doesn't remember when he's been able to catch more than four hours of sleep a night. \"I had very vivid nightmares,\" he said. Those nightmares often included a bird. \"A big black crow. It would flap over my face, trying to take my breath.\"\n\nLater in his teens when White worked at Long John Silver's in a town 38 miles away, he experienced more missing time. \"I was riding my motorcycle. I remember that night very specifically. I worked a double shift,\" he said. \"Before I left town, I filled up my (gas) tank.\" As he pulled onto a gravel road toward his parent's house, he saw an orange ball hanging low in the sky. \"I stopped and thought, 'the moon's a weird color,'\" he said. \"Then I saw it was not the moon. The moon doesn't block the landscape.\" As he got closer, he saw this orange ball was thirty to forty feet in diameter, and hovered five or six feet off the ground.\n\nHe got off the motorcycle three hours simply disappeared. \"It's the last thing I remember,\" he said. \"It was 7:35 p.m. At 10:30 p.m. I pulled into Dad's driveway and something zoomed over me and disappeared into a valley.\"\n\nHe stopped the bike and got off, leaving it running as he dashed to a fence to look for the light.

{"eta": "[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends that are so prevalent in the history of the Megawatt. It began with a post by the usual suspects (CJ Palmer, etc.), with the exception of David Lee, who rather vehemently refuted them to the tune of twelve pages. But still, I did not hear until recently from any at all those other Big Four; James D. Quinn, the current President of J.P. Morgan Chase and myself, Paul S. Brandt (also a BBW), and indeed William H. Crumpler, who is the President of the Nature Conservancy. What a pleasant surprise! The other stories that are circulating again are: (1) John Julian's warning that the new technology was \"amplifying our dominance over nature and altering the natural order.\" He apparently worried that this was being used as a \"nightmarish new weapon against us.\" (2) a boastful announcement from Rockefeller that \"the current generation of means of determining energy, weather, and climate is simply not up to the task of analyzing changes occurring to the atmosphere, oceans, land masses, and forests.\" Then he quoted the limited scope of the project. (3) a response by a prominent educator, \"The significance of the Megawatt should not rest on its sheer size. If it proves to be such in its potential ability to be utilized by all mankind to meet our needs for power, energy, and food, it will be a significant achievement of technology.\" Another message from Paul Buell, a president of the Edison Electric Institute, was more more succinct: \"This is a monumental loss not only to the ecology but to humanity itself as well.\" (4) a vision by a young lawyer at Princeton, concerning our modern, multi-ethnic, multi-culture society, namely that \"Millions of people\" would be \"controlled in each individual home, by some own-minded and wealthy couple, so much so that only a few would benefit from buying and selling at the market.... so that the greater part of the population's income and wealth flow from a few individuals or at most to a few real estate brokers.\" Apparently, these allegations were right on the money, for it had reached Mr. Jacobson himself, when in response to a question about this theme by a Q&A at the post-nuclear Future Forum in Fall 2005, he said: \"In the ancient world the worship of the sun god and the moon goddess (or moon goddesses for that matter) was the major focus in worship, and the central principle of religion for most of human history. The worship of the earth goddess, a mother goddess, a shepherdess or she-cow goddess has become increasingly rare, and a diversity of other, more universal influences in the world have become the center. So how can I see this as anything other than a seemingly benevolent dominant force in the world?\" And, indeed, so this seems to be what is going on, and that is an interesting aspect of the problem. In many ways it seems quite primitive! \"There are problems to be solved, because we have big problems to confront. There is a terrible tendency in the human heart, and in the human brains, to see the world not as we want it to be, but as we are supposed to be.\" -- Nathanael Greene, cited by Paul Buell in his testimony at the post-nuclear Future Forum in Fall 2005 (not the equivalent in this case of Arthur C. Clarke's explanation of the nuclear winter). DNR: I apologize for the absence of quotes from the editors of both J.P. Morgan Chase and Nature Conservancy, but they have indicated they would like to be included in the chronology. The post-nuclear Future Forum in Fall 2005 did not extend beyond twelve pages of John Julian's article, for which the Post's researcher has been quite thorough. I agree with him that the potential of these technologies to potentially make an enormous impact on the environment and global living is extremely large. But here I prefer the exacting logic of Mr. Julian; I prefer his point of view. I find them both to be amazingly naive at this point, for it is only the scientific development of energy and metallurgy that will make the society of the future almost a given, and indeed that is what's clearly at stake. In my opinion, the post-nuclear Future Forum could have served to educate people about the fact that as much as we would like to give up the human purpose of energy and metallurgy -- and their lavish profit motives and enormous profits -- the real threat is the small minority of large corporations which own the large resource industries, which will dominate whatever society form we elect for a new century. This is because they will always command a majority of the public's opinion on matters of public significance. I think they are quite naive to think the actual downside threat is that the energy", "topp": "[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends about Sherlock Holmes being a spiritualist, a sultan, a military officer, or to, uhh, look at that seduction of an older woman. Well, now, finally, I'll get to set the record straight. Turns out, our whole love affair with Sherlock Holmes (I am not going to quit, hell, I'm going to keep running this site no matter what!) has actually had quite a spiritual side to it, even if we've forgotten about it for a long time!\n\nIn our infinite desire to be obsessed with this theme, I was going through my old posts on our site when I came across this delightful article, \"The Incredible Scientific Case Against Sherlock Holmes Being a Spiritualist,\" written by commenter Mary Kymishuk. This article was published May 16, 2006 (free pdf copy below).\n\nRelevance: This article has appeared a few times before on our site (here, here, and here) and we suspect it may have died some odd death for all the show has become now that the Cold War has taken a back seat to terrorism in the realm of the paranormal. Mary mentions that a National Geographic documentary would bring Sherlock Holmes' talents to the masses once more, which is an excellent idea. The documentary is under development; we're sure it will be excellent (although probably slightly understated). How 'bout that?\n\nOriginal Article\n\nUpdate: Mary is back at it again with a lively blog post. More and more people are coming around to the basic three premises that have always been part of the fictional world of Sherlock Holmes, namely that Holmes is a grim, immoral character with a nihilistic stance regarding both fate and emotions, and that he always has a nose and a spine; that evil people eat brains, just as people have noses and brains. Indeed, just last week a British dietitian announced that her homeopathic doctor had proven herself to be a \"warlock\" by bringing an international boycott on all ginger products.\n\nSeductive Lady and (Grue-starved) Cherry Bomb : Wells seems to indicate that and mumble that Holmes was all about sadism, and we finally get a reference to his penchant for seduction that hasn't been mentioned in the books before. Again, I never thought it would be possible to slay Sherlock (and his poor partner, Dr. Watson) by seducing a woman with a cherry bomb, but this seems so. Too bad all this happened since we got to know a cherry bomb as a graphic snack when we were kids.\n\nHowever, of course, cherry bombs don't need to be tasty. When I was a kid, a funny thing happened and I remember feeling terrifically unsettled after having to break up with my high school girlfriend. It was like digging a crater into a powdery black tea cake-type crust. Unfortunately (or fortunately, I don't remember the reason for this miserable experience), nothing could have helped me find happiness - why? - because this was the present Earth, not one of mythic proportions like a fantasy world. Of course, cherry bombs are just desserts, and little food could't solve my deepest loneliness. However, there's no reason why they couldn't make me miserable, because this time, I have already been overcome by it, so the whole world having crushed my eyes and torn open my body, so to speak, has only made it worse! Indeed, this was the exact same experience of me destroying a steam-powered police car. After shrugging off this patch of mist, I went to an Aunt Sally's and got some field-tested Strindberg surgical masks to wear over my teeth. Was I dead? No, of course not. I still had a future. Still, of course, I found myself in an all-day psychiatric ward.\n\nWhat Mary Kymishuk suggested and Wells has continued to suggest is that Holmes is the anti-Watson. Sherlock Holmes is prone to behaving unpredictably, so Watson needs the FBI to keep up with him and constant surveillance is obviously very helpful. Indeed, Holmes helped to foretell the First World War, and this was he who pulled the British Commander-in-Chief out of retirement to lead the charge against the Turks. But there are no spoilers here. You'd have to be quite foolish to decide to read The Golden Bough before you have a chance to enjoy The Return of Sherlock Holmes. In other words, once your eyes have been gaped open a few weeks before the movie comes out, I have a feeling that you're going to be at a lost in the wackiest library for a while.\n\nWhat might have happened if I had believed that? They could have applied an unlimited amount of constant additional surveillance! And Holmes would have had an unlimited supply of sermons to give in return for flaunting some", "human": "[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends and myths on wireless LAN security. Every time I write an article or blog on wireless LAN security, someone has to come along and regurgitate one of these myths. If that weren't bad enough, many \"so called\" security experts propagated these myths through speaking engagements and publications and many continue to this day. Many wireless LAN equipment makers continue to recommend many of these schemes to this day. One would think that the fact that none of these schemes made it in to the official IEEE 802.11i security standard would give a clue to their effectiveness, but time and time again that theory is proven wrong. To help you avoid the these schemes, I've created the following list of the six dumbest ways to secure your wireless LAN.\n\nWireless LAN security hall of shame\n\nMAC filtering: This is like handing a security guard a pad of paper with a list of names. Then when someone comes up to the door and wants entry, the security guard looks at the person's name tag and compares it to his list of names and determines whether to open the door or not. Do you see a problem here? All someone needs to do is watch an authorized person go in and forge a name tag with that person's name. The comparison to a wireless LAN here is that the name tag is the MAC address. The MAC address is just a 12 digit long HEX number that can be viewed in clear text with a sniffer. A sniffer to a hacker is like a hammer to a carpenter except the sniffer is free. Once the MAC address is seen in the clear, it takes about 10 seconds to cut-paste a legitimate MAC address in to the wireless Ethernet adapter settings and the whole scheme is defeated. MAC filtering is absolutely worthless since it is one of the easiest schemes to attack. The shocking thing is that so many large organizations still waste the time to implement these things. The bottom line is, MAC filtering takes the most effort to manage with zero ROI (return on investment) in terms of security gain.\n\nSSID hiding: There is no such thing as \"SSID hiding\". You're only hiding SSID beaconing on the Access Point. There are 4 other mechanisms that also broadcast the SSID over the 2.4 or 5 GHz spectrum. The 4 mechanisms are; probe requests, probe responses, association requests, and re-association requests. Essentially, youre talking about hiding 1 of 5 SSID broadcast mechanisms. Nothing is hidden and all youve achieved is cause problems for Wi-Fi roaming when a client jumps from AP to AP. Hidden SSIDs also makes wireless LANs less user friendly. You dont need to take my word for it. Just ask Robert Moskowitz who is the Senior Technical Director of ICSA Labs in his white paper Debunking the myth of SSID hiding.\n\nLEAP authentication: The use of Cisco LEAP authentication continues to be the single biggest mistake that corporations make with their wireless LAN because they leave themselves wide open to attack. Cisco still tells their customers that LEAP is fine so long as strong passwords are used. The problem is that strong passwords are an impossibility for humans to deal with. If you doubt this, try a password audit of all the users in your organization and see how long it takes to crack 99% of all passwords. 99% of organizations will flunk any password audit for most of their users within hours. Any attempt to enforce strong passwords will result in passwords written on sticky notes. Since Joshua Wright released a toolthat can crackLEAP with lighting speed, Cisco was forced to come out with a better alternative to LEAP and they came up with an upgradeto LEAP calledEAP-FAST. Unfortunately, EAP-FAST still falls short in security with its default installation. Although Cisco makes LEAP and EAP-FAST freely available to partners for the client end, the same is not true for Access Points.LEAP and EAP-FAST are essentially two proprietary protocolsthat Cisco employs as a strategy to monopolize the Access Point market. There are open standards based EAP mechanisms like EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP which are all much more secure than either LEAP or EAP-FAST and they work on all Access Points and client adapters, not just Cisco. Cisco does support open standard EAPs just like everyone else so you should always use open EAP standards to get better security and avoid the hardware lock-in.\n\nDisable DHCP: This is much more of waste of time than it is a security break. DHCP allows the automatic assignment of IP addresses and other configurations. Disabling DHCP has zero security value and just wastes time. It would take a hacker about 10 seconds to figure out the IP scheme of any network and simply assign their own IP address.

{"eta": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo at the University of Texas Annual National Security Forum\n\nOctober 12, 2017\n\nGood afternoon everyone. (Applause.) Last Friday, we had a successful operation to capture a top al Qaeda terrorist who is wanted by the United States for murder. He was killed in a successful airstrike by United States and other coalition forces while he was on a mission in Afghanistan.\n\nThe strike in the Kohat area in Afghanistan is the second major defeat for al Qaeda this year and represents a significant reduction in the organization's operational capability.\n\nI want to focus on another victory, the ISIL offensive in Iraq and the continuing progress of our Iraqi partner forces that have now pushed the militants from the major cities of Ramadi and Fallujah.\n\nThese victories offer the clearest example of what the coalition stands ready to do to degrade and defeat ISIL.\n\nBut ISIL is not defeated in Syria. ISIL has increased numbers, strength, and geographic mobility, and the threat to Europe and to the United States continues to grow. For the same reasons, we need to continue focusing air power against the organization in Syria until it is no longer able to threaten the United States or our allies. This is why we launched a new strategy that we will now execute on the ground. (Applause.)\n\nThe strategy we released last Thursday is. (Applause.) It goes beyond the U.S./Coalition offensive to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. It establishes a global coalition targeting all transnational networks that traffic foreign fighter networks into and across Iraq and Syria. (Applause.) We know how devastating a network like al Qaeda's global networks can be; they pose a threat that transcends borders.\n\nWe urge allies, friends, and partners around the world to broaden their perspective about the threats we face from ISIL beyond the Middle East. We urge all nations to take a leading role in eliminating this menace for all to see.\n\nThis strategy will let our allies make the most of every moment we have to reduce that global threat.\n\nWe are accelerating our training efforts on the ground to better prepare the Iraqi security forces to address ISIL's security threats. We will begin turning away from the U.S. trained security forces in Syria and Iraq and see them directly support them on the battlefield. The coalition may find it hard to sustain that effort, but it's part of a robust international effort to defeat ISIL.\n\nThe coalition has made progress in training local tribal fighters and incorporating them into the fight. We want to ensure that the Iraqi people are part of this battle now. We will begin training the Iraqi military much faster and better than we ever did before and build a local force that has a better understanding of the threat that they face on the battlefield.\n\nSo the battlefield has changed. No one envisioned that the battles in Syria would take on that gruesome intensity and that the war, in more than every way, would last so long. Our efforts are focused, long-term, on defeating ISIL and ensuring the defeat of this network of Islamist terrorists. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I want to thank our Iraqi partners from all different sides. The Iraqi security forces, most of which are equipped with the newest equipment, have made significant progress defeating the enemy. Of course, the U.S. military, after months of fighting with some remarkable precision, has finally caught up with the enemies of America, and so too have the Iraqi people. They have advanced to the very end of the street where fighters are hiding. What a peaceful conclusion we all look forward to today. (Applause.)\n\nBecause of this success and because of the commitment of our Iraqi partners, I am proud to announce that on October 11th, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has become the first Iraqi leader to be granted presidential status. (Applause.) President Trump has asked for Prime Minister Adem al-Abadi to assume the mantle of leadership, because of his great popularity and the country's strength and progress under his leadership.\n\nAnd I want to emphasize that our current fight in Iraq is only the beginning. ISIL is spreading far and wide across Iraq and Syria. Our coalition has taken land, airfields, weapons, and advanced platforms to put pressure on them, and we will continue to do so. We are taking those efforts farther than they have gone before. This is a sustained, sustained campaign. Not a one-off. Not a return to the boxcar politics of the past. This is a sustained effort that will be as long-lasting and damaging as the terrorist attacks of September 11th and to come into effect in October. (Applause.)\n\nOur partnership with Iraq has deepened. It is stronger than ever. We have stepped up coordination and training across the region and even the world. Our countries now share intelligence, coordinate operations in the battlefield, and build off other partnerships. And of course, the ground forces have", "topp": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo at the University of Texas Annual National Security Forum\n\nOctober 12, 2017\n\nGood afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to attend a conference here in Austin, Texas today that's hosted by the Institute for the Study of War on Terrorism and will be held today, October 12, at 6:30 pm. The national security forum is an initiative of the National Security Archive to encourage thoughtful discussion of issues in national security by post-9/11 scholars and practitioners and to identify the connections between government policy and terrorism. The forum will be streamed live online.\n\nIt's fitting that President Trump is there today because one of the most important actions of his administration \u2014 the rescinding of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA \u2014 was driven in part by an effort by George W. Bush's administration to combat terrorism in a speech he delivered in Chicago.\n\nGiven what we now know about that speech, it would be a serious mistake to think that this event was a mere opportunity for President Trump and the administration to demonstrate that they care about its lessons. In fact, it is of major national consequence to some of our nation's most critical political, policy, and cultural players.\n\nSo in the best traditions of the Institute for the Study of War, I'm proud to be here today. I'm also pleased that a distinguished panel of scholars from the National Security Archive is co-sponsoring the event. In fact, since January, the Archive and the academic community of war and national security experts across the country have been meeting in Arlington, Virginia, to discuss ways that modern scholarship and media for defense of democracy are working together for our greater security and the larger fight against terrorism.\n\nDuring my remarks, I'll discuss three recent events regarding our commitment to national security both here at home and abroad.\n\nFirst, President Trump has announced a departure from two of his campaign promises \u2014 namely, that he'd focus more on making America \"great again\" than on creating jobs and reducing the deficit. The Oval Office proclamation announcing that his administration is \"great again\" is unfortunate and misguided on its face, and it amounts to a continuation of the strategy that we have been seeing throughout Trump's tenure. Rather than creating jobs, his administration will likely result in more hardship for the American people, whether through policies consistent with his agenda or simply through the actions of bureaucratic bureaucrats in various federal agencies. That said, having seen these actions taken by the Trump administration at first hand, both and for both color and flavor \u2014 and very much in the spirit of being vigilant and skeptical of any and all executive branch efforts \u2014 I respectfully urge the President to not stray from the message that America does more together than they do alone. Rather than creating jobs, these policies could lead to the complete extinction of key jobs to close out this administration's first 100 days, including both transition and regulatory initiatives related to manufacturing, science and tech. The estimated productivity of government job services would drop by 13 percent over that same period \u2014 without the creation of a single new job. In the past, increased deregulatory efforts from this administration have resulted in cutbacks to essential functions and undermine public safety. With all the steps taken from the outset, I understand the President is in a position to adapt at his convenience and the potential for cooperation, but unfortunately, he's intent on waging a costly war that will throw hundreds of thousands of workers and families into some of the deepest poverty. In addition to losing manufacturing, these policies could also dramatically harm the U.S. economy, hurting the poor, those with special needs, and those who are already vulnerable by undermining security and the schools that will serve them. Unemployment will continue to rise, and further skill-based destruction could last years, potentially requiring more expensive, temporary solutions to complete whatever challenges are to be overcome. The path forward on these issues is simple: get the Republicans and Americans of all stripes to acknowledge, embrace, and endorse this minimalist strategy for reducing the burden of government job creation and keep your eyes and ears open for growing opportunities, including in broader win-win cooperation that can benefit a wide range of popular and invisible interests, not just employers and the leaders of these core job providers.\n\nSecond, President Trump has announced that he will nominate a new Secretary of Homeland Security who will lead a new, unlawful, contentious, and, frankly, unnecessary DHS. The one-star previous Secretary of Homeland Security was removed from power in secret after an investigation revealed that he was a member of an organization dedicated to protecting children from Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe next Administration should not announce its choice for the position until a full investigation has been conducted. If that does not occur by the time of the incoming Administration's inaugural swearing-in, there will be no one to preside over the administration of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Given the relative incompetence of the current Secretary of Homeland Security and his refusal to work with Congress to find a competent replacement, the American people should", "human": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo at the University of Texas Annual National Security Forum\n\nOctober 12, 2017\n\nGood afternoon everyone.

This professional activity is at the heart of the organization I am now privileged to lead.\n\nIn America, we don't do espionage for fun, although it often does bring joy and professional satisfaction. We don't do it to help American businesses or to gain information about Americans.\n\nNo, in our Republic, the CIA's espionage is aimed at the singular purpose of collecting foreign intelligence to keep America safe. Period. Full stop.\n\nI raise this, because while it may seem trite, or even pedantic, it is, as I will share with you today, central to the effectiveness of the team I lead. So that will be my first point: the effectiveness derived from conducting espionage that is solely focused on supporting America's national security.\n\nThe second thing you must know is that the CIA, to be successful, must be aggressive, vicious, unforgiving, relentless \u2014 you pick the word. We must every minute be focused on crushing our enemies and providing unfair advantage for our diplomats, our military and our President.\n\nThis too may seem obvious, but it has not always been so straightforward. Today, I want to share with you why this matters and how we are punishing our enemies in order to defeat them.\n\nBut before I return to why the purpose of CIA's espionage is so central to our success and to the fact that unceasing risk-taking is foundational, a quick reminder...\n\nAt this very moment, there's a CIA team preparing for a mission in a very dangerous part of the world. There's not much of a US footprint there, nor is it a place where our brothers and sisters in the military can operate.\n\nThe infrastructure our officers will need there will be built by the Agency's support specialists, who can set up shop anywhere on the planet. The communications and surveillance equipment they require will be provided by our science and technology experts, whose achievements are legendary. And if there's a need for cyber support, our Directorate of Digital Innovation staff will troubleshoot for them.\n\nThe point is that CIA wouldn't be adding much value to the national security effort\u2014or providing value for American taxpayers\u2014if we confined ourselves to the relative comfort of world capitals and fancy embassies. The secrets of greatest utility are typically the ones embedded within the most rugged and hostile environments and possessed by those who do not share American values. If President Trump is to make the right policy choices there, he needs to understand the facts on the ground in the grittiest back alleys, densest jungles\u2014in the hard places.\n\nEvery day, including this one, CIA officers take extraordinary risks to put crucial intelligence in the hands of our President. A few weeks back I was with an officer a bit younger than most of you in this room, had early that morning come back from an operation that would be rejected as implausible by any worthy publisher. The President rightly counts on us to answer his questions about global threats, trends, and hotspots. And if we do our job right, we give an enormously unfair advantage to him and his top policymakers when it comes to dealing with foreign challenges.\n\nNow that our heads are collectively set in the world in which the CIA operates, back to the main mission for today.\n\nThe CIA's Purpose and Why It Matters\u2014A Comparison\n\nSo, why do we do what we do? I don't mean simply why do we conduct intelligence. That's obvious.\n\nThe important question is: For what purpose do we conduct espionage? This purpose matters. Let me show it by comparing our efforts with those of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nAt our founding, Americans were deeply skeptical of collecting intelligence, leaving the United States alone among the great powers in being reluctant to even get into the spy business. It took two world wars before CIA was established in 1947 as America's first comprehensive peacetime intelligence agency.\n\nLike all other elements of the US national security community, we take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. We strictly abide by our nation's laws. We're subject to oversight by the elected representatives of our fellow citizens.\n\nAnd as I said, because we conduct espionage that is solely aimed at supporting our country's national security, we work with a sense of duty, purpose, and righteous resolve\u2014and we're a lot more effective because of it.\n\nLet's compare this with the intelligence service of the world's largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran.

REUTERS/Andrew Winning\n\nIraqi Kurdistan is seeking to meet Kurdish leaders' six-month demand for one-third of its share of the oil wealth expected to accrue from an interim tax agreement signed in Paris last month.\n\nThe Iraqi Kurds worry that, even if Iran, Russia and Turkey agree to provide financing to revive their stuttering economy, the project will threaten their oil revenues and sink relations between Baghdad and the Kurds.\n\nAccording to oil trader Johnny Holm, countries already sending ships to ship Kurdish crude to China include Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHe told Reuters the first ships were seen leaving from Kuwait on Friday, with some expected to reach Indian Ocean ports of Oman and Malaysia before reaching Asia.\n\nHolm said China was likely to be the next country to ship into the Gulf as Iran and Russia are also trying to persuade Baghdad to support the international coalition fighting Islamic State militants, offering the Kurds in particular incentives to sell more oil.\n\n\"Iran and Russia are directly involved in the negotiations and pushing for Iraqi Kurdistan to build a strong economy,\" said Holm, adding that Russia was trying to revive the economy under pressure from Western sanctions.\n\nIn a separate development, Iraqi parliament voted last week to approve the constitution and prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, after months of uncertainty as the opposition party failed to agree on a single draft text after weeks of disagreements.\n\nIn a rare rare concession for Abadi's Democratic Party of Iraq, the opposition agreed to back him as \"the candidate of the legitimate government... in order to restore the government's credibility\" before a June 10 election.\n\nOPPORTUNITY TO SELL\n\nThe Iraqi state gas company NHG.O is trying to sell KRG crude to the central Asian oil exporter Turkmenistan Gas, from where the Kurds could sell the oil if they chose.\n\nAn Iraqi official close to negotiations for the exports confirmed Baghdad was ready to sell KRG crude to Turkmenistan, saying Iraq could get around sanctions by selling to Turkmenistan on the Russian market.\n\nThe official said the company was working with the oil ministry to secure an export license from Turkmenistan for the oil - the first step in getting the commodity onto the Syrian market after the collapse of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\"We are getting close to selling oil. The parameters need to be discussed with the foreign ministry. The transfer should begin in two or three days and the export should be authorised after the examination,\" he said.\n\nWidespread violence since Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government moved to crush its \"Revolutionary Command Council\" in July, which wanted to set up an alternative governing system for the Kurds, and the Baghdad invasion of Mosul in which more than a million people are estimated to have been killed, has lifted a blanket of economic sanctions that followed the formation of the Kurdish region in Iraq nearly 20 years ago.\n\nOne government official with direct knowledge of the crude pipeline deal said some Iranians were now interested in trying to sell oil directly to Baghdad, risking international sanctions because of their relationship with Turkey and Iraq.\n\n\"A portion of the oil has been sold directly to Iran with different companies having offices in Tehran in order to circumvent the Iranian ban,\" the official said.\n\nIran has been part of the coalition forces backing the army offensive in areas liberated in recent days by the Iraqi army, and Tehran is also assisting in restoring civilian electricity to parts of the north that have been paralyzed by fighting.\n\nBut an official close to the nuclear negotiations with Tehran said Iran would be allowed to use its positions to negotiate for oil exports if it helped establish a transfer agency.\n\nIf that happens, the Kurdish refinery's barrels would be sent to a pipeline station in Iraqi Kurdistan, where, as yet, the oil is exempt from state control and Iranian state entities such as oil and gas companies face no further restrictions on oil trade in Iraq while Iraqi Kurdistan gets one-third of its own land sales revenues, the official said.", "topp": "LONDON (Reuters) - At least 3 million barrels of Iraqi Kurdish oil are on ships heading to Asia, with trade sources naming China as a possible destination as the autonomous region seeks to challenge the global oil cartel OPEC.\n\nIraqi soldiers secure an area in Baghdad in this picture released by the provincial council on November 13, 2014. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nThe trade sources also told Reuters the oil could go to Asia from the Black Sea port of Varna if Baghdad's deal with Turkey, an ally of Tehran, goes ahead. The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nThe export deal could allow Iran to increase exports of Kurdish crude to at least 9 million barrels per day, up from around 6 million in the current year, traders said, in line with the existing agreement.\n\nIran, a major buyer of Iraqi crude oil, has a quota of 550,000 barrels per day.\n\nOman, Oman's biggest buyer of Iraqi crude oil, is said to be angling to buy up to 50 percent of exports in 2014, the sources added, though it is not clear how much.\n\nSrelit Masoumim, director of the traffic incident management center at Varna port and a former Iraqi oil minister, said that even if the contract is signed, much of the oil still needs to be loaded onto ships.\n\n\"It is possible that they (Shiite-led Kurdistan) would receive the oil through cooperation with Varna,\" said Masoumim, who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity.\n\nMinister of Shipping, Muhammet al-Ali, has ordered all ships entering Varna port to steer clear of shipping tankers and ships with Kurdish flag carriers or with Kurdish expatriates, said Masoumim.\n\nA box in a pipeline of the Iranian oil pipeline carrying Kurdish crude oil is seen in Ayaran port in Ayaran district of northeastern city of Kirkuk, Iraq December 29, 2014.

Our job is to deliver it and make sure it is profitable.\"\n\nThe last export shipment of Iraqi oil to Europe of around 2 million barrels per day was made in November 2011. However, about half of this cargo was seen on Iranian vessels trading in the past few days and several oil tankers have sailed in this vicinity.\n\nCoal shipments are rare, said Suhail Ghaith, spokesman for the governor of the semi-autonomous region's central region. All of the thousands of Iraqi coal mines, he said, are owned by Baghdad.\n\nThe two main buyers of Iraqi crude oil are Iran and Turkey, along with some other major Asian and European markets.\n\nVarna said all of its overseas sites were safe. It said in a statement that demand for Iraqi crude oil from Europe had declined to 11.37 million tons in September from 22.44 million tons a month earlier.\n\nTWO BASIL SPRINGS\n\nKurdish independence activists in Iraq's disputed Kurdistan region of northern Iraq have previously threatened to create two new basins to crush the influence of Iran.\n\nSenior official Ali Karim Muhanna of the parliament's main Kurdish party said Iran was continuing to engage in land grabs and planting new roots in the region.\n\nThe KRG government, citing its rights, has blamed Baghdad and against the wishes of Iran it has hit back. While the two main Kurdish political parties - the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) - are siding with the KDP, regional leader Masoud Barzani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) is against its policies and has accused Tehran of encirclement.\n\nMAKING IT FUNNY\n\nBut the limitations of Kurdish oil flow show how central government and its regional allies are struggling to balance the influence of Iran and its militias, and of their own Kurdish population's unhappiness with Kurdish leadership's experience of war.\n\n\"In the current political environment it is difficult to make it funny,\" said Abd al-Ghani Maliki of Tabnak, an oil trade company on the Iraqi side of the border with Iran, referring to the oil trade.\n\nMuhanna agreed, saying: \"In this battle there are much more regional countries than just the Arab countries.

REUTERS/Azad Lashkari\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the matter said Iraqi Kurdistan was in talks to potentially supply China with 4 million barrels of oil.\n\nReuters was unable to identify the Chinese parties involved in the talks, which the sources declined to name, and it was not clear if the cargoes currently on the water were part of the discussions.\n\nA deal could place Beijing on a collision course with Baghdad, one of its major crude oil suppliers, which has tried to block the Kurdish sales that it says are illegal. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) argues they are allowed under the Iraqi constitution.\n\n\"The Kurds are in the process of negotiations with the Chinese,\" said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\n\"China is buying up multiple origins of oil. So, there is not an issue from that side,\" the source added. \"It will come down to price.\"\n\nSince May, Iraqi Kurdistan has shipped over 11 million barrels of crude from the Turkish port of Ceyhan. The Kurdish sales have been shrouded in mystery, and the KRG has declined to say who is helping it arrange the deals. Trading sources said they may have to discount the oil to attract buyers in a well-supplied market.\n\nAccording to a Reuters analysis of tanker tracking data, at least three Kurdish cargoes of 1 million barrels each have sailed from Ceyhan towards Asia in the past month, including one that was transferred to a supertanker near the Strait of Singapore on Monday.\n\nPrior to the latest shipments only one 1 million barrel cargo had gone to Asia, but the KRG may be seeking a new major buyer after an attempt to sell crude into the United States this summer became embroiled in a legal tangle.\n\nChina's giant state-backed energy firms, including China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and PetroChina, together work on over a fifth of the Baghdad-run oil projects. But Beijing also has stakes in Iraqi Kurdistan's oil production through Sinopec's 2009 acquisition of Addax Petroleum [SASAAP.UL].\n\nEstablishing a buyer as large as China could provide reassurance to other countries and companies who would like to buy oil from the Kurds but fear the ramifications of crossing Baghdad, which has repeatedly threatened legal action.\n\nSenior officials at CNPC and Sinopec declined to comment. A spokesman from the KRG's Ministry of Natural Resources declined to comment when asked about the talks.\n\n\"KRG crude, priced at a significant discount, is finding its way across the world to many destinations despite the reluctance of big trading houses due to backlash from (Iraqi state oil marketer) SOMO,\" said another source involved with the talks, who also declined to be identified.\n\n\"As one of the world's biggest crude buyers, China is no exception. I believe that a deal is imminent for Chinese refineries to purchase KRG crude.\"\n\nSHIP-TO-SHIP\n\nThe Ultimate Freedom suezmax tanker, carrying 1 million barrels of Kurdish oil from Ceyhan, this week carried out a ship-to-ship transfer of its cargo to the Northern Star, a Very Large Crude Carrier that can hold 2 million barrels of oil. The vessels were just outside the Singapore Strait in Malaysian waters.\n\nAn official at the Malaysian Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) and the ship's captain confirmed a transfer between the two vessels took place.\n\nThe Singapore-based head of shipping at Nathalin Offshore Company Ltd, which manages the Northern Star, denied its ship was involved in a ship-to-ship transfer.\n\nTwo more Kurdish tankers, the United Dynamic and United Emblem, have sailed through the Suez Canal in the past week and are listed as heading to Asia 'for orders'.\n\nGROWING SALES\n\nAfter a stuttering start, Iraqi Kurdistan's oil sales now appear to be gaining momentum.\n\nMore tankers have loaded at Ceyhan this week, while a number of deliveries in the eastern Mediterranean appear to have been made since the start of this month.\n\nThe KRG's oil sales efforts increasingly resemble a cat-and-mouse game with Baghdad, with tankers loaded with crude frequently turning off satellite tracking before reappearing empty several days later.

The big scowling Czech defenceman was lying in a hospital bed, drifting in the fog delivered by his post-operation IV drip, a giant, grimy, purple pill suspended above his stomach.\n\nOne of the few words out of his mouth was \"Plea\" as Polak looked through the old photo album that had been left with one of his teammates. Without thinking, he said the most famous phrase of his life, one that has become one of the most iconic in the history of a hockey warzone.\n\nThree months after he suffered the impact to the brain following the collision in the Memorial Cup final, a crater left by the final stroke has appeared in the icy, unforgiving Montreal rink.\n\n\"I want you to check up on this,\" Polak said last week. \"This happened after this hit.\"\n\nThe story of a perfect, silver-lining accident erupted over the next two years.\n\nThe amazing story of an imperfect, middling effort went viral.\n\nFirst, the headlines: The 2004 Olympic gold medal-winning Czech defenceman then 33 had an erratic year. Despite his overnight play to become a future Norris winner, he hadn't even lived up to expectations and was traded to the Islanders for goalie Darren McCarty.\n\nAnd finally, as the Islanders quickly peeled off their lid, the NHL and the NHLPA pitched in to pick up the tab on his 5,500-pound medical bill, nearly $1 million on the headline alone. After an initial $600 payment had been applied and the balance eaten up during arbitration, the settlement came with an additional $2.5 million for time spent under general anaesthesia and others that will occur after he decides he wants to return to the NHL.\n\n\"That injury happened out of nowhere,\" Polak told the Ottawa Sun shortly after agreeing to a one-year, $800,000 deal on July 31, 2004 -- two months after he spent surgery in the spring. \"I never had a concussion in 10 years. I won my Olympic gold medal without even looking on the ice. I got injured and then I wasn't too good, so I was traded. Everybody will say I will play sooner or later. I don't know.\"\n\nThe next summer, when Polak refused to speak to reporters following a Nov. 2 practice, it was all reporters.\n\nAt last season's training camp, Polak explained how lucky he felt at the onset of the end of his career.\n\n\"I knew it was going to happen one day or maybe more,\" he said. \"It was just a matter of how many.\"\n\nBut as the years wore on, the medical problems grew worse. By mid-February 2007, he broke his wrist on what he said was his 9th skate. The decision to retire came two months later, perhaps simply a matter of time before the mountains of medical bills would overwhelm his paychecks to the tune of $6 million.\n\nBy then, he was slipping and his condition was uncertain.\n\nIn July 2008, the day after the Red Wings traded him to the Islanders for a second-round pick and Jason Pominville, Polak informed a stunned media pack outside the hotel where he was staying in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I have to wait two months. I will see about two more players (elsewise, I would have left and gone to a team in the Pacific and the price would have gone down).\"\n\nLast week, just after NHL director of player safety Ron Roenicke announced that there would be more concussion awareness and education for players in this season's preseason, Polak gave another glimpse into the overwhelming burden of his own son's brain injury.\n\nIn a letter to the media, he wrote: \"It's the hardest thing I've ever had to face. Like all boys, I played hockey through the years. But it didn't change the way I looked at things. Some of you guys have been calling now that I'm signed, but I don't really get it. I miss hockey. The thought of playing doesn't seem as appealing anymore. I'm still working out. I have to pick up my game. I can't just relax. I have my whole life left and I just hope to change my mind about going back to the NHL after I have died.\"\n\n\"I never get confused with this, but I always thought I'd play again, maybe be back on the ice one day. I started thinking about it and then I thought about my family. This guy has left behind a daughter and a son and a sister and he was my one hope.\n\n\"I feel angry at the guy for not accepting responsibility for what he did, but maybe somebody will be held accountable.

He's known for being a duffer, but he's done it this way all his life. So it's hard for people to accept that.\"\n\nNo, the prize, he said, wasn't a million dollars \u2014 his annual salary was $270,000 after taxes.\n\nIn some way, the prize, he said, was still the Lower Don children, now 23 and 21.\n\nThe same happened on Saturday, as Kessel flew to Toronto to repay the impact of March 24 with a classic Leafs' performance.\n\n\"We knew what had to happen,\" they said. \"We were all like, 'he could win it tonight.' I still can't believe it.\"\n\nKessel forced most of the Leafs forwards to take the ice without the Sedins, with Daniel Sedin sidelined by a rib injury.\n\nIn a short span, they invented a power-play transition to crown the biggest scene from the ice as Kessel threw a net-front pass from centre ice to Patrice Bergeron on a line shift to tie the game 2-2 at 5:13 of the third period.\n\n\"It's nothing short of amazing,\" Kessel said as he reflected. \"The theme to the game was 'don't stop.' I'm stoked.\"\n\nThat's understandable, given that Kessel felt they wouldn't be allowed a customary pre-game rite to make this memorable. The Leafs' first post-season appearance was a distant dream, with another crowning trip envisioned.\n\nFour-and-a-half years later, they won Game 7 in Boston.\n\n\"I wasn't supposed to be in there. That's what they're doing in Boston,\" Kessel said with a laugh.\n\n\"But there's something about that series \u2014 they won four straight. And then they went to overtime.\"\n\nBefore the game, the Sedins took out their BlackBerrys and showed off some impressive scoreboard footage from their 2013 Olympiad \u2014 done for the all-star ceremony \u2014 as the game opened around 4 p.m.\n\nOn the West side of the ice, the power couple evoked a memory on one of their favorite dinners: chocolate-covered orange dog sitting on a grill, surrounded by warm carrot cake.\n\n\"When the players get on the ice, they're serving it as a gift to the fans,\" Talbot said.\n\n\"Everybody is a loser when we play, but hockey is a bummer for us.

But he remembers that he didn't want his teammates to see him like that. That stuck.\n\nIt's been a long, slow, painful recovery for Leaf blueliner Roman Polak. ( Graig Abel / Getty Images )\n\n\"They had a tough schedule, and I didn't want them to see me, there,\" says Polak now, five months after 13 screws were installed to repair the broken leg he suffered in Game 2 of the Toronto Maple Leafs' first-round series against Washington. \"I'd rather stay by myself.

I probably wouldn't remember it.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nPolak is in camp for the Leafs, and you can tell. In one drill at a morning skate before Tuesday's pre-season loss to Ottawa he pokes at centre Dominic Moore, and knocks down Patrick Marleau. He is also part of what might be the last generation of true smash 'n' bash defencemen. After he cross-checked Connor McDavid during a World Cup warm-up and Auston Matthews retaliated by cross-checking Polak, Polak's assessment of the Matthews hit was, \"good technique.\" \"He likes to hit people,\" says Matthews. \"That's what that definitely told me. He actually hit me pretty good earlier that game.\" And while it's hard to be a basher in a league that gets faster every second, Polak was one of coach Mike Babcock's security blankets last season. But the injury \u2014 that half-twirl into the air, the landing \u2014 was gruesome, and it's a long road back. Goaltender Frederik Andersen was right next to former Leaf Stephane Robidas when he suffered one of his broken legs, and thought right away this was the same thing. \"Well, he's just got to get healthy,\" says Babcock. \"To tell you the truth, I haven't paid any attention to him, until he's in a situation to play in a game, it's just a matter of him on rehab.\" The night of the injury Polak was devastated: As teammate Nazem Kadri puts it, \"he wasn't in good shape.\" Beyond his emotions, it was the most pain Polak had ever experienced, and that included the time a puck tore through his cheek and he returned to the bench with stitches. As the Leafs landed back in Toronto he felt the cabin pressure squeeze his leg: surgery provided some relief. And that was the start.\n\n\"After three weeks here I went home, and I felt just useless,\" says Polak. \"Because you are on the crutches and playing with the kids or something, and I just can't do anything. So you're there but you're not there, because you just can't help. So basically for my wife I was basically like the third kid.\" His 5-year-old daughter Isabella would dote on him, bringing him cookies, candy, and drinks; his 2-year-old son Markus delighted in swinging the crutches around. \"He was smacking everything,\" says Polak, with a note of fatherly pride. (He has both their names tattooed in script on his right arm, and once wore matching Halloween costumes with Isabella.) He spent three months on crutches.

{"eta": "Here are two small tricks that can help if you're making an isometric 2D game in Unity. Ok, so not actually isometric, but that's the term we're using.\n\nFirst, to fix the distorted terrain, I can just use the gravity console in Unity to center it.\n\nOpen up gravity.console and find the line that says \"scale\". If you look in the console, you can see it says \"scale to x unit\"; the unit I'm using is \"units\". So if I'm working with \"units\", I would write out \"scale to 30, 50\".\n\nMy terrain should now be able to fit right within the unit space I'm using.\n\nSecond, I can just add some buttons and tall grass as support to the top and bottom of the player. This is because the FPS fps counter gets stopped after some seconds, but something that shows the time the fps counter stops is nice; it helps me understand what time it is if I can detect when it's over ~15 minutes and just continue playing. It's like if the FOV of your controller was 0, but your FPS counter was 0.5, you would see it as the FPS counter continues to tick at 0. But in Unity you would see it tick at 0 when it's over 15 minutes.\n\nThis is another technique I use a lot for 2D games. When I'm designing 2D games, I don't add the vertical scroll bars by default. Instead I use the Item sprite and hover effects in order to make sure that the player has more room and is able to see the \"end of the level\".\n\nI also sometimes use item sprites, so as not to use the item sprite like I always do in my level editor. I just add the sprites on with a rect that's a little bit larger in order to make it fit the margin of the screen.\n\nIf you look, you'll see that I have the ground-hugging bird sprite. I can also add small drops for each floor as I create my levels, just making sure I don't end up with big drops on my flight levels and create some obstacle and make each drop serve a purpose. \"OOPS, this could have been used to end up in the water instead, oops. And then there's the little wasp death hazard in the hole at the end of this level. And the cool\u2026we'll get into that later.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I'm done with setting up my level, I can look at it in the editor and see how the features of the level match my and how the player interacts with them. And if I have to make some changes, it just so happens that the editor makes it easier than the game engine!\n\nWhat's In A Level?\n\nI'm going to go over the different levels I'm used to making and give a short explanation of how I think they go together. When I draw a level, I leave all the character and props off. That's because if all I have to take off is one sprite or one object, I don't have to worry about creating anything on top of it in addition to that sprite or object.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis goes back to why I like to add more custom sprites. Just because I've got more of something on top of a level doesn't make it part of it. And as I mentioned above, it would break the atmosphere if I had to take away all these custom sprites. Any custom levels that you're making should generally be static. A static level is one that wouldn't need any custom sprite at all. The only exception would be a level that's animated, where if you've got a kill or death happening in the background, you could take all the action in the level into that and make it fluid.\n\nBut if I draw a level, then I'll throw in everything at this point other than those custom sprites and I'll make sure I've designed everything in relation to the level, just like I designed the level or something.\n\nExample 1: Set up a Man Cave Scene\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am going to be playing with a flat, flat level like the one the creators of the Man Cave Simulator make for their level editor. The Level Builder class they use is not really intuitive because it's so procedural.\n\nEvery step was made by a level creator, it took about six or seven hours to get all that stuff, and each move was manually exported to sprites as these generic entities to build the levels. There's multiple folders for each level, each folder has a new level editor, and a new document that contains the level editor and the level folders for the player to edit or build their own levels.\n\nSo I thought I'd take the time to do this custom level thing, and I thought I'd highlight some things I did in my own personal level editor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first thing that I added was a wall,", "topp": "Here are two small tricks that can help if you're making an isometric 2D game in Unity. Ok, so not actually isometric, but that's the term we use for 2D games that have oriented 3D backgrounds \u2013 which can work well with Unity if they're reasonably orthographic, like Orbis or the like.\n\n1) A key thing to make sure you have in place is right graphics is lighting. If you want your game to look isometric, set a default lighting profile and use lights without light bulb colours. Or a simpler option is to use a color lookup table to use the brightest, brightest and brightest colours on the value range. I still use a separate light table for my canons, and it makes life much easier when I want to change something, if for instance it turns out we need separate light columns on different levels of the wall.\n\n2) Most important of all, do not make any 3D objects which are likely to be on screen, and do not have any visible collision. This for a work-in-progress picture:\n\nYou want the collision to be minimal, else you're turning your project into an isometric point and click action game, without the I am an pixel.\n\nThat's pretty much what you want to use to get your isometric work done!\n\nRedrawing the previous picture\n\nThis is more interesting, I'll explain how it works after I explain what I mean when I say 2D and 3D aren't necessarily the same thing. So what you're probably thinking is, \"in my work-in-progress (which is work-in-progress) aren't these spaces interchangeable?\" Well, yes, at least for now! So when you're just drawing isometric images on this video, you're drawing on canvas and if you start to draw things that are on the other side, we're all going to end up in a world with backfaces and perspective and stuff! You'd have to fix it up in a static scene\u2026 Well, that's a little more complex.\n\nThe solution is to drop your isometric images over the top of the canvas. So all you need to do is:\n\nMove onto the bottom canvas and draw something by right clicking, or drag an image to it, go to Object \u2192 Object Browser \u2192 Draw, find the image you want, right click and go to objects \u2192 Edit mode. Make the image a white rectangle with a border, with the image cut off off the top of it. Place the first object you want the image over on the bottom canvas, also without making the image white, leave enough space so that the object's centre is the black strip of water. This example is very simplistic, there are a number of ways to approach this, I suggest you try it out.\n\nIt's important to remember this, you're going to move the image around from picture to picture to avoid having to squish the top of the canvas into a single pixel. That's where rendering (dribbling) will come in handy, and it does the trick for the example below:\n\nJust got that one checked\u2026\n\nIn the last picture, I've rounded all of the knobs so it looks I'm making something isometric. By making the upper image super tall (to have 3D objects on it), I've prevented it from jiggling around inside the canvas.\n\nHere's the other thing I've got off of using the hole: the brush value, because to the right is a black knob. This says that there should be no bit-count between any adjacent pixels, in other words, no pixel where a pixel of the lower image would overlap a pixel of the upper.\n\nNow on the image on the right, compare if the pixel from the upper to the bottom-left pops up or not. If it doesn't, there's a missing bit of #pixels. Slice the image down the middle, and subtract this whole thing down, and that's how you should change the level. Now take out all that stuff, and up-bit that whole important pixel.\n\nSo my 2D advice is: do not start with the rectangle on the right-hand side of the image, just run right through the middle, and you're done. It may seem like a big deal, but so far it has made life a lot easier.\n\nColourisation\n\nOkay, now you've got the canvas all ready and your images are clearly isometric, let's start colourising things. You don't want to run a colour printing process, you want it to be circular, which is why the layer will likely look a bit\u2026 odd.\n\nThere's a method called very simple colour coding and it's used in almost every image editor that supports live brush components (I'd put Maya / Illustrator because it does all the hard work of organizing your paint routines, all you have to do is customize the built-", "human": "Here are two small tricks that can help if you're making an isometric 2D game in Unity. Ok, so not actually isometric, but that's the term we're used to in videogames, so we'll go with it. These are quite basic and if you're working on such a game you've probably already tackled them your own way. This is our take on it, hopefully it's useful to someone.\n\nSprite Ordering\n\nNormally in a 2D game there is no concept of depth, so if you simply place the sprites in the world, you'll most likely have objects appearing in the wrong order than what you'd expect in an isometric game.\n\nThankfully Unity exposes Sorting Layer and Order In Layer properties for Renderers.\n\nA quick fix is to set the value of Order in Layer to depend on the Y position of the object.\n\n[ExecuteInEditMode] [RequireComponent(typeof(Renderer))] public class DepthSortByY : MonoBehaviour { private const int IsometricRangePerYUnit = 100; void Update() { Renderer renderer = GetComponent(); renderer.sortingOrder = -(int)(transform.position.y * IsometricRangePerYUnit); } }\n\nThis solves the problem for the simplest case, when we assume all objects rest on the ground.\n\nLet's assume we want to have an object that is above the ground in the world, like placing a bird house on that tree. Just trying to place it in the world will treat the pivot of the object as being at ground level, with no way to both place it at a proper height and sort it correctly.\n\nThere are several options for this. Just to get it out of the system, the first option is to add empty space to the texture below the bird house to make sure the pivot is at ground level (in Unity, the pivot can't be outside of the sprite). This is baaaad! This is wasting texture space, and all instances of that object will need to be at the same height in the game. There are other, less insane, options.\n\nOne is having a height property in the DepthSortByY behavior and subtract it from transform.position.y when computing the sorting order.\n\nAnother solution (which we went with) is allowing the DepthSortByY behavior to make the depth computation based on another object's transform. This way, the objects will be considered to be at the same point in space as their target and they'll have the same depth order, even if they're at different Y positions in the scene. In the bird house example, the bird house uses the tree's world position for its depth computations.\n\nThis solution works better for our game, because it allows artists to move the item freely while staying at the depth (and not have to deal with editing the \"height\" parameter). And mainly because all the gameplay takes place in the ground's 2D plane anyway so all objects are guaranteed to have a root object that has the ground position. In your own game, it might be easier to just use the first option.\n\n[ExecuteInEditMode] [RequireComponent(typeof(Renderer))] public class IsometricObject : MonoBehaviour { private const int IsometricRangePerYUnit = 100; [Tooltip(\"Will use this object to compute z-order\")] public Transform Target; [Tooltip(\"Use this to offset the object slightly in front or behind the Target object\")] public int TargetOffset = 0; void Update() { if (Target == null) Target = transform; Renderer renderer = GetComponent(); renderer.sortingOrder = -(int)(Target.position.y * IsometricRangePerYUnit) + TargetOffset; } }\n\nThis is how this example is set up in Unity:\n\nAnd this is how it behaves in practice:\n\nGround Projection\n\nFor certain visual elements and effect, we wanted them to look properly projected on the ground, but also not spend too much time on making art for them. The 'isometric' view of the game means that anything that is horizontally on the ground should look squashed vertically.\n\nFor simple sprites, this is quite easy. Just draw them directly with the correct perspective and place them in the game.\n\nThings get more complicated when you need something that should be able to rotate in any direction. Like something to show the direction the character is moving in, or some visual effect sweeping the ground towards your attacking direction. Especially if these are things that are animated, drawing them manually for all possible orientations is out of the question (or so the artists claim).\n\nOur solution is: the artists draw and animate these effects as if viewed top-down, and the programmers take care of transforming them at runtime to look as if they were projected on the ground.

Last summer, some 200,000 non-paying supporters of same-sex marriage gathered at two pro-marriage marches in San Francisco. But now, after the corporate-backed legal challenges failed, these same people may find themselves on the losing side in a court of law.\n\nWith more than 70 percent of eligible voters turning out in support of Proposition 8 and 73 percent of the votes in Washington State, the voters have spoken. The same people who dominated the life and work of Prop 8 have lost the battle.\n\nIn a fairly short period, from 2008 through last June, Prop 8 supporters in California amassed enough money to file challenges to the California Supreme Court and to the state Constitutional Court. And Proposition 8 supporters were able to secure first ballot access of all 47 of California's counties before the beginning of June.\n\nBut, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who won with a long-shot run for the U.S. Senate, has lately been ramping up her enforcement activities. And she is now sic-ing her special counsel, John Kitzhaber, on Prop 8 supporters.\n\nThe reality is that so many of these \"plaintiffs,\" many of whom have been behind these legal challenges with some of the same companies and people who bankrolled Prop 8, now threaten to sue the attorney general and the California Legislature if Harris is going to spend money for marriage equality.\n\nProp 8 opponents are pursuing every avenue they can to block legal assistance. They are aggressively trying to strengthen the state constitution's \"Wells-Unlikely Defense\" statute. A law allowing individuals to go before a court and seek injunctive relief is limited only by judicial discretion.\n\nThe late Democratic attorney general Ted Gatsas in San Francisco at the time of Prop 8 and then Governor Schwarzenegger, now running for governor, vigorously enforced the statute.\n\nIn February, George Mason University's John Bursch Professor. Douglas NeJaime opened a four-day symposium titled \"Immigration Law: Courts, Trust and Trusteeship in State Constitutional Law.\" But the focus of the symposium was on \"Confronting Constitutional Judicial Antitrust Injustice in California.\"\n\nNeJaime argues:\n\nWhat, exactly are \"real\" judges supposed to do if they find that they are legally challenged and might lose their self-image as impartial arbiters and keep taking their case to court for them, you know?\n\nIt certainly looks as though the Department of Justice (DOJ), rather than upholding the constitutionality of the judiciary, but rather is trying to assert a monopoly on \"justice.\"\n\nCitizens across the nation and beyond want to see Judge Lynn Leibovitz removed from his position as presiding magistrate, because she actually violated the separation of powers. But the process is looking sluggish.\n\nA California grand jury is about to open its hearings about the Brown v. Board of Education decision that grants same-sex marriage and some observers are beginning to think that another gay marriage ruling is imminent. But Leibovitz might have to move out of her house first because a judge warned her about her legal home, arguing that the lesbian couple of her same-sex marriage may have rent-controlled their first homes.\n\nThat and other challenges by defendants and the district attorneys for over 30 counties are continuing. And some observers consider the odds of another California trial on same-sex marriage to be slim, at best.\n\nThe proposition's supporters made it clear that they are staying on the offensive, even if they are faced with legal and political problems. Here is a view of David Boies, partner and lead counsel for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, speaking at an April rally in San Francisco.\n\nHere is Mark Anthony Neal's view on the same day, in San Francisco:\n\nDork News: Dukes of Hazzard America \u2013 Recall the Hazzard Lawsuit for Conviction\n\nDukes of Hazzard America \u2013 Conviction Gets 35 years for Hantz Rape of Emilee Pr", "topp": "Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendment\n\nby Rick Moen\n\nAugust 25, 2008\n\n(last updated August 6, 2018)\n\nThis past century, people have fought and won big time over attempts to legalize \"gay marriage,\" and over the high court's recent victory in the Supreme Court, in which five of the same-sex couples who had sued to have California's gay marriage ban struck down won a victory on appeal. Now it's about to come to a head in California.\n\nThe same gay marriage \"opposition\" that tried in vain to get Proposition 8 on the ballot in 2008 will get their second chance to apply to change state law in California. Sadly, \"neither the American public nor the State of California have any interest in the outcome of this case. (The) American public has no interest in preventing a legal ruling that bans all forms of statutory discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation...the State of California has no interest in finding the legal ruling unconstitutional. The Supreme Court does.\n\nThe California Court of Appeal ruled last Thursday that the new law in question, Proposition 8, was invalid. In the case, the last word will be on the Prop 8 ban, so go to California's Secretary of State website and enter your ZIP code if you are not sure how to get an accurate vote count. You can also check out www.Proposition8.ca.gov and the California Secretary of State's website. If you live in California, you should register and vote to prevent this status quo from happening to any other California residents in the future. (To register, go to the webpage below)\n\nStill, this is an important victory for gays and lesbians in the Golden State, yet a very \"small victory\" because of the necessity of such a verdict. And that is because, in this case, the Supreme Court has changed the law by striking down the statewide ban on marriage between same-sex couples.\n\nTHE BAN on same-sex marriage only came into effect in June 2008 when voters approved a ban by a vote of 52% of the vote. This was to be the end of the ban after three years of debate by the Legislature when proponents voted to amend Proposition 8, passed by 64% of the vote. They were to then go into effect on July 1, 2008. However, the last minute addition of Section 3, which was section 2 of the November 7, 2008 ballot proposal, removed Section 3 entirely and provided the backers the opportunity to re-enact the ban without having to call a referendum. That's why the courts basically ruled that if the ban was removed from Prop 8, the language and amendment it used to repeal it no longer applied to same-sex couples after this last-minute move. But, there is more to this question than this latest ruling: the same group that gathered to support the Prop 8 ban filed a petition with the state Supreme Court on May 27, 2004. The petition focused on Section 3 of Prop 8, and that evidence can be found in the federal court case in the case Keyes v. Itasca County Board of Supervisors (California Family Council v. Itasca County). Just last summer, the petitions of four couples were submitted to the court and were assigned to a judge. That judge has already decided to take the petitions into consideration, and he will decide if the Prop 8 ban will stay or whether it will be struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nSection 3 provides that a law shall be upheld if it is based in a sincere belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman and that the state should not enfranchise individuals who believe that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman. This means that Proposition 8 was based on the Prop 8 supporters' sincerely held belief that same-sex marriage is or should be illegal \u2014 the likeliest justification for an overturning of that law. Now that Section 3 has been struck down by the state Supreme Court, it is the campaign against the same-sex ban who will have to deal with the penalty of lawsuit. Does this make California same-sex marriage legal again? The state law to outlaw same-sex marriage has not changed since Prop 8 passed in 2008. It still states that Section 3 cannot be used to legalize same-sex marriage. So Proposition 8 supporters could still bring these action in the courts, or they could try to change that status quo through the ballot initiative known as Yes on 8.\n\nThese are the bills that are currently being reviewed in state district courts. The landmark marriage equality bill has been referred in state court for a hearing, and the marriage equality section of Prop 8 is being discussed in state district courts. So you would think that the gay marriage ban on Proposition 8 has been overturned in California and the supporters of Prop 8 are likely to be re-enacting their campaign against it at the ballot box this November \u2014 but that will likely be the case only if this state statute is struck", "human": "Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendment\n\nby Rick Moen\n\nAugust 25, 2008\n\n(last updated August 6, 2018)\n\nThis past century, large portions of the American South have been consumed by an unintended side-effect.\n\nI refer to the infamous \"kudzu\" vine, imported from Japan for its stunning erosion-control properties. This tactic worked: Crumbling riverbanks and hillsides were stabilized all over the South \u2014 but, then, everyone realized with mounting horror that this hardy legume is almost completely unstoppable anywhere protected from hard freezes, growing at the awesome rate of a foot per night and reaching heights of 100 feet. Entire abandoned houses have been observed to vanish under a kudzu carpet, over a summer growing season. It's now considered a pest; sometimes, an outright menace.\n\nThe plant can be used with caution, where its invasive side-effect is known and planned for \u2014 but the point is that it was deployed without understanding its full effects.\n\nLaws' side-effects, likewise, can render them self-defeating (though, on the bright side, bad laws are easier to eradicate than kudzu): I'm going to explain, below, why recently popular marriage-definition legislation like California's November 2008 \"California Marriage Protection Act\" (an initiative state-constitutional amendment) creates kudzu-class unintended side effects its proponents haven't anticipated and will find horrific \u2014 in that they're going to end up mandating and legally sanctifying exactly the sort of same-sex marriages they're intending to ban.\n\nPlease note: Yr. humble author is deliberately avoiding the question of whether same-sex marriage is desirable, an offense against God, and so on. (For what it's worth, said author is a heterosexual genetic male, happily and monogamously married to qty. one (1) heterosexual genetic female. So, this essay is not a sneaky ploy to induce gender confusion in unwary citizens.) It's not that I don't have opinions on that contentious question. It's just that they're not relevant to what I'm writing about.\n\nIn short: I'm going to show that recent legislation restricting marriage to \"a man and a woman\" \u2014 regardless of whether you consider that effort good, bad, or indifferent \u2014 is going to produce harmful, unintended side effects (maybe even for you, your family, your friends, and so on), exactly the opposite of what proponents intend.\n\nI'll not be moralizing, and this isn't lobbying from the \"intersex\" movement or anyone else. I'm just a regular hetero guy, quietly telling you what's starting to happen, why, and how to see for yourself. OK?\n\nMarriage Protection Meets Biology\n\nHere's the sort of law we're talking about:\n\nProposition 8\n\nEliminates Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry: Initiative Constitutional Amendment SECTION I. Title This measure shall be known and may be cited as the \"California Marriage Protection Act.\" SECTION 2. Article I. Section 7.5 is added to the California Constitution, to read: Sec. 7.5. Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\n\nNow, that's simple and should have predictable, orderly results, right? I'll bet the Soil Conservation Service guys in the 1950s thought that about kudzu, too.\n\nThe biggest problem is that laws like the California initiative will make the courts decide who is male and who is female \u2014 and all available decision criteria create unavoidable miscarriages of justice that will, or should, dismay initiative proponents.\n\nYou're probably thinking, about now, that I'm going to exaggerate the sex-definitional1 problem: Probably, you and everyone you know is unambiguously male or female \u2014 or at least has always believed himself or herself to be so, and nobody's challenged that, and nobody's likely to.\n\nThat's true, absolutely: Only maybe one live birth in 100 has some non-standard sex anatomy, and genetic anomalies are slightly rarer than that. However, let's talk about those 1-in-100 or 1-in-1000 cases \u2014 because those could be you, or your aunt, or your best friend \u2014 and because our system of law has to deal with 1-in-1000 situations, too.\n\nAn illustrative example: Let's say you're an adult woman. You were always female; you never had any doubts about this. You have all the right parts and none of the wrong ones; you think of yourself as a gal. You get married. (Yes, I do mean to a man.)

The idea is that it's a viable means of meeting Australia's demand for live animals to be slaughtered for human consumption. But whether it can be sustained for the present is another matter.\n\nLEIGH SALES, REPORTER: With authorities in Europe and Japan facing scrutiny of the illegal exports and questions about whether it's really a threat, the problem has moved past merely being a fear, and is looking increasingly like a financial one.\n\nERIC FOGLER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL COMMISSION: Well, it is a serious economic problem for Australia. I mean how is it going to be sustainable and affordable if people aren't going to be able to afford it? And it is a problem that needs to be fixed before we can be at least thinking about the question of whether or not we export animals for human consumption.\n\nMARK POTTER, REPORTER: The numbers involved in the trade are small compared to commercial beef exports. But in an era when the wild world is being poached for its meat and parts \u2013 the trade is a significant one and was touted as a way to boost domestic demand.\n\nPOLITICAL ADVISER TO SENIOR MINISTER: Abroad, the demand for live animals is greater than we could possibly have expected. And so, one of the options that has been offered to us is to enter into, like, a significant expansion of the export programme.\n\nANNIE SLEFTON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ACT NATURE AFFAIRS: The idea that this is some sort of panacea comes in a report which says that 10 million people are already on track to be meat-eating animals by 2060, and that there are myriad things that Australians will have to do to live in a meat-free society. So, to then look at exporting animals for meat for these other things is not exactly the evidence we need.\n\nKAREN LEWIS, BARNY KROUWERS WALKER FORUM AUTHOR: Meat and milk is a thousand-year-old product, and no-one has looked at whether or not the meat industry has to change.\n\nGEORGE MYERS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: The 'imitation pork' issue is problematic and will have to be addressed if we are to be importing and exporting animals that are healthy, rather than animals that are dying naturally, therefore being unable to obtain a stable living situation on their own. And so those are the issues that need to be considered going forward.\n\nMARK POTTER: The meat industry says the problem is with supply. They point out that if they weren't prepared to process fewer animals for the same price as they would for farmed animals, it's not as though there was no demand for their product. They also point to the problems with diseases spreading if meat does not go through a more strict process and that no one wants to pay twice for one dinner.\n\nRYAN HUFFMAN, REPORTER (airport): The meat in the supermarkets now at $6.95 per kilogram is normally $6.5 to $6.3 per kilogram, so you might get a six per cent jump in the price in that store that morning, but if you're really comparing the cost of it to say, say the meat that people normally buy, you might see something like a 10% difference.\n\nCRISIS NEWS NETWORK (CNSNews.com.au): Aran Zagon, a former wild horse and bison trainer, has been down the dirt roads of Central Australian with just about everyone from Sarah Ferguson to Jack Lambard to ask you about your beef suppliers with Dr Pareja.\n\nTRANSLATION: He promised the rabbits would all be skinned and eaten by pigs at his establishment and this was the order.

The explanation for such wholesome animals is the ability for a pet to endure under pressure in the harshest conditions on earth, an ability that is admired by foreign consumers, and cheered by officials like Sean \"Bunny\" Kelly in the Australian Customs and Border Protection service.\n\nMs Fridlund says, ironically, that being a \"good neighbour\" is less important to authorities, and a cost-benefit analysis would show the only reason there is such demand for animals at the moment is because of federal policies.\n\nSCOTT GILL, REPORTER: With Anzac Day coming up, we thought we'd take a closer look at three things that most people won't know about the hardworking work of border officials, including their fierce determination to keep animals from ending up on the slaughterhouse.\n\nMembers of the Parliamentary Press Gallery gather outside a major Australian Customs building in Canberra.\n\nMARK TAYLOR, VICTIM OF VETERANS' BID DROPPING RESULT: It's much easier for a pet to be smuggled, especially a little person, than a really big one, even if it's their family. It is a big object that they are carrying around and quite often little children will be carrying it.\n\nMARK TAYLOR: Despite successful border crossings and a growing market for animals including animals from the Far East, animal smuggling is now home grown in Australia.\n\nDespite a Government more concerned with security than it is about bringing vet care and humane conditions, officers report that greater amounts of animals are trafficked to Australian shores than ever before.\n\nMARK TAYLOR: The North Shire, which is referred to as the leading point of Australia in terms of the presence of animal welfare concerns and anti-captivity legislation, is the main hotspot for this activity.\n\nThere are, we estimate, around thirty-two hundredkgs of animal hide, fibre and fiberglass being exported from here every single year.\n\nWe estimate that the price of animal exports from this region is between four and six thousand dollars, so four thousand dollars over the total value of the animal export industry in Australia.\n\nANGUS QUINN, FAR EAST COAL MINER: The first thing that we notice during an inspection is that there is no local electricity supply and everyone comes to work completely in darkness.

But Mr Robinson has expressed in other media interviews his contempt for the ESCAS process.\n\nGARY ROBINSON, GM, LIVESTOCK SHIPPING SERVICES (ABC Radio, 15 Oct. 2013): It's failing exporters because exporters can't operate their business properly.

It was a claim that was later disproven. Wellard diverted its shipment to Pakistan.

{"eta": "This is the parable of the bottle of wine that promises so much and delivers so little. It begins with my mother who called to say she'd been given a bottle that promised to make my life better and she was not willing to take it. She said so much \"it's no use\" she didn't want any more. The woman I was offered said she was the \"perfect\" selection for my father but is so close to the threshold of what wine deserves to be she could never taste it. She was right. Not a moment went by when the bottles I made myself did not taste and maybe not a bit did it not taste good. There was no end to my produce and my life. The people at the plant, where I was always offered free trials by their boss they were all in complete support of how I was doing. They were smart to work with me and my lessons learnt were not for them. I won their trust and everything was going great.\n\nOver time they passed me along to other plants and it became clear that most of them were on the same path, they would pass me along to their employees and lie to them, so as not to cost them too much and hand me over to a company that didn't know what it was doing. Sometimes I was offered to be a contract worker. My mum ended up running what I was told was a successful wine growing business. Her people would tell me to not buy from them. No \"can't help me now, I'm trying but I can't get things done it's just not working\".\n\nI ended up pouring out more and more wine and started losing it. Not tasting, not tasting well, having many examples of the failures it was causing, when all I needed was forgiveness and the wisdom of hindsight to see why I was acting this way and understanding it would have to change. As bad as it was, it was still something I loved. I kept knocking on the same door asking and getting no answer, I got so frustrated (and maybe wish I hadn't hit so hard) I made a grab for a sharp object, which missed and got my head knocked off. The flip side of the coin was I still had it on me. Soon my mum, who'd been working in the wine industry since she was born, found out and called me over. My work was done and I was on my way home.\n\nI cried on the way to work, I cried at home. I came home crying but my dad, who'd been off work was worried sick. I didn't sleep for days. I questioned if maybe I needed a nap. I cried because I couldn't see how I could do this every day for years. I was driven to suicide.\n\nThe motivation would be, \"I want to do this but I'll never be able to do this. I won't be able to do this, it won't do me any good I want to get away, I know it's a pipe dream and it's stupid.\" I'd tell myself no it's not stupid, it'll work out but it's just an idea that I need to get across to people, it's rubbish, it won't happen. That's the good part, it doesn't mean it won't, you just have to push through. I was through and it was all over.\n\nSometime in this year I felt I could no longer recover, I had to talk to someone who could, who was in a place of authority.

I was caught up in my own sadness, I was lost. I was, and always will be, a survivor of burnout.\n\nIt was more than a month before I had the courage to talk openly about the topic with him. I told him why I couldn't do it anymore and told him about my life experience since at the age of 29, it had changed my life in so many ways and I needed to move into the future. That was it. I'd done it. I did it.\n\nA month and a half later I can say without a doubt, after watching him grow up I have never been more proud of my brother. What I got out of my courage, what I got out of my story and my actions, is not only that his life has changed, it has opened up many conversations between us. Like I said he's on a journey and today he's 14 years old. We've shared many conversations and my life lessons are there for him.\n\nEven if I was to go back to school tomorrow, don't let your boss know you want to do this.

It begins with my mother who called to say she'd been given a bottle that promised much to my father, who served a night in prison before it was sold at auction to a young man who became that day famous as a university dean. And to top it off, my father sold the bottle to an American who planned to build a millionaire by selling the wine. The story ends with my mother getting more than she had bargained for; her family's livelihood was shattered and she had to turn to alcohol to recoup a deposit on a car she could never afford to buy. It is this horror story, the downward spiraling of debt and of hope, the search for a glass that never lived up to its promises, the broken dreams and empty guts, that creates not only the black and white images of my childhood but some of my biggest memories.\n\nEach day you spend without any sense of accomplishment or security goes in time. That seems sad because that sense of accomplishment is important in life, sure, but as one wise man told me \"to fight a myth, one needs to be able to fight a nay-sayer, to be able to challenge the status quo.\" I have a couple of recent challenges. The first of these is coming to terms with the fact that I work in Hollywood as a writer with an entire industry to support. The second is to stop complaining and start writing about my life.\n\nMy career doesn't require massive elevation; there are ample ways of making an honest living. It's real, it's honest, and for many it's exciting. But I also need the stress of working on a living wage to feel like I exist as a person. How do I do this? There are no easy answers, but those I find most helpful are going to those who describe themselves as \"workaholics\" and learning to embrace that label. Do it quietly, do it now, on the advice of those who love watching us struggle.\n\nI guess I want you to get the two things your natural reaction to this: you're a failure and that everything is awesome. So that you can get that boost of energy to jump on the next project. You want to break your stressful habits and start feeling proud of yourself.\n\nI like to think of my own career as 'his dream' life. If I were to fall in love and really fall for the beautiful woman to whom I want to spend all my time, having her speak to me in my dreams would be a nice boost in my life, too. Some of the top stars in Hollywood speak to their clients in a bit more depth and intimacy than other people, so it gives me a bit of a super power in my conversations with clients. Perhaps that can be a model for my own life.\n\nSo take a journey with me through the stressors of your life, from putting out fires that take more energy to winning the lottery every year.\n\nThe Grass Is Always Greener\n\nOn a semi-regular basis, I get letters from people who have been crushed to death by this idea. And maybe you did too, just thinking through the idea of being crushed in a world where instant gratification is possible, based on people with $250 bills to match your sex appeal. You would be too good for someone who's poor, or's likely working all day and needs your money to keep him or herself from being miserable and possibly end up hooked on drugs. And you know what? You should really start writing letters to someone so you can explain to them why your idea is something that you need to live up to. Too often too many people are driving a bit too fast on their judgement of themselves.\n\nOne of my regrets about home-schooling my children is that I failed them in the past. I hoped that kids couldn't work hard at something that wasn't that important. That kids couldn't mature at a relatively small age; they needed discipline from their parents who were home more than their teachers. I wish I'd stayed with them more as they got older, but alas, that was my. I didn't realize there was a world of possibility out there for them.\n\nAnd perhaps you should look to those who have done something similar. I hope that you don't end up doing the same thing you were before \u2014 falling in love too late, falling into debt too fast. There is something to be said for the experience of someone so young writing your love letter and reading it \u2014 like a song or a poem \u2014 at a young age. If it can be recorded and be shared like a YouTube video, great! But consider where you are writing it from and what it means. That's the most important question you should be asking yourself.", "human": "This is the parable of the bottle of wine that promises so much and delivers so little. It begins with my mother who called to say she'd been given a bottle that looked very impressive. What was it, I asked.\n\n''Oh, I knew you'd ask that. I don't know. It's a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. That's good isn't it? And it's from Marlborough, which I know is good too. [Heavy sigh] All right, I'll go and look\u2026 It's called, I don't know how to pronounce it but\u2026 Wairau Cove.''\n\nI'd never heard of it but as it turned out I got to try it the very next evening when my friend Olly brought a bottle to a dinner, saying he'd ''bought it for a fiver, reduced from \u00a310 so it ought to be fantastic\".\n\nOh dear. This wasn't auspicious. Wine sold at \"half price'' is rarely worth any more than you pay for it, and sometimes not even that.\n\nThe psychology works like this: even though many of us are suspicious of ''half-price deals'', since they're usually created by hiking the initial price so high that it can be dropped again, we still have a hazy idea that hidden away in the \u00a35 we are not forking out there must be some sort of bonus.\n\nWhat bothered me even more was the New Zealand connection. This country isn't known for discounting heavily. Instead it forged a reputation based on quality, persuading us to spend a bit more to buy a mouthful of its clean, green land, as the slogan goes. New Zealand wines commanded a higher average bottle price here than any other country's wine and the premium worked in our favour, too: we paid for good wine, we got good wine, a state of affairs more unusual than you might think.\n\nAdmittedly, some were better than others, but by and large New Zealand, because it hadn't rushed to supply supermarkets with low-priced, undrinkable tat, was a brand you could trust.\n\nThe erosion began in 2008 when a huge harvest led to a grape glut. Wine, much of it still good, was sold off cheap. Problem: once you introduce people to cheap, they start expecting it. Result: that's what they get, often at the expense of quality.\n\nA year ago we paid an average of \u00a36.43 for a bottle of New Zealand wine. Today, thanks to increased discounting, it has dropped to \u00a36.02 per bottle (still way ahead of France, its closest competitor at \u00a35.01, or the general average of \u00a34.39).\n\nWairau Cove (which I discovered is sold at Tesco) \u2013 now back up at \u00a39.99 \u2013 is as good an example as any of the sort of NZ sauvignon blanc \u00a35 buys you. The best I can say about this wine is that it had a strong elderflower taste and would have been a brilliant buy to add to a punch made of cordial, soda, wine and lemon juice.\n\nAs a glass of wine it smelt tired, had lost its fresh zing and had the starchy, watery taste of slices of raw old potatoes. At dinner, I noticed my friends trying small sips then abandoning it for something \u2013 indeed, anything \u2013 else on the long, crowded table.\n\nIf you can't rely on the name of New Zealand to guarantee the quality of your wine, you end up having to play detective and here, besides the offer, there were two big clues that all might not be well.\n\nThe first was the name: Wairau Cove is neither a winery nor a place. It might sound familiar because Wairau Valley is a subregion of Marlborough (incidentally, asked if the grapes actually come from there, Tesco could only say that ''the vast majority of them had\") but Wairau Cove doesn't actually exist. The second was the small print on the back label that indicated the wine was bottled in the UK. Together these two clues point in one direction: bulk wine.\n\nBulk wine is wine sold off in liquid mass by co-operatives and wineries who don't want to bottle it themselves. In the case of established wineries this might be because they want to get rid of tanks they don't consider good enough to sell under their own label, or because they have a surplus from a rapidly ageing vintage they need to jettison before the next one comes on-stream, or for some other reason.\n\nWith Wairau Cove, the bulk wine comes from several sources but there are four key suppliers. Tesco refused to say who but I understand these include Pernod-Ricard (whose Montana \u2013 or Brancott Estate, as we must now call it, but that", "eta_suffix": "Even if I was to go back to school tomorrow, don't let your boss know you want to do this.

Known as the \"Wild Angels\" for the sacred white feathers they carry around their necks, the two men continue to inspire Navaho mythology by their bravery, humility, and follow-through in dire emergencies. In 1900, White-Shell Woman visited her long-lost brothers through the hole to the secret tree of celestial creatures, and she encountered her twins, the legendary Shoshone and Pawnee warriors, who brought her greetings and gifts to celebrate the reunion.\n\nBut as exciting and as vital are the connection of Shoshone and Pawnee to the sacred feathers of the White-Scaled Bear. As the Native American Legend of the White-Scaled Bear recounts, when White-Shell Woman's hair became so white, her twin brother would steal pieces of white feathers from her head, and instead give them to him or her as presents. Even today, many Navaho continue to carry white-winged feathers around their necks as sacred bundles.\n\nSince the 20th century has been a fraught one for Pawnee history, incidents have seemingly unfolded, in the form of local ranchers, land-grabs, a land-rights dispute, and a major armed standoff.\n\nBelow, a fascinating chronology of Pawnee history through the 20th century.\n\n1839. Harney County; J. B. Mason dies \u2014 brutally murdered. He is buried with the wagon-riding legends. His body in a mound is protected by elders to this day. In 2002, white elders found the remains at 4,300 feet, protected by a chain of cairns \u2014 almost 500 years after his death. The silver skull with its eye sockets, glowing toes, and feathery feet was returned in 2015 by a Native American burial site dig with the help of a U.S. Geological Survey archaeologist. It is a strange, high point. The Pawnee want it back.\n\n1876. Round Point Indian Village destroyed by John Stoddard, who used lead bullets to kill 200 young girls, to create a \"quarantine\" \u2014 to turn Indian females into witches.\n\n1884.

Marion County: Mary Babbitt, former sheriff's granddaughter, eventually leads a movement to reclaim Native American rights.\n\n1889. Four white men take refuge in Marion County after being evicted from their settler's lands in Roanoke. One murdered local black priest. John Babbitt (flank, at right) is sent to jail.\n\n1890. Pawnee longhouse land is purchased by Henry Chapman, who later writes about the fun he had with the Cherokee Indians.\n\n1891. Court orders land to be returned to white owners.\n\n1892. Few Pawnee make it out of what appears to be the \"warp\" of suicide \u2014 12 tribe members (including white patriarch Joseph Goodman) shot themselves to death, one by one, in a Southern Pawnee symbol of the death of a brother.\n\n1894. Eleven white workers and their horses were killed on a pine plantation south of Benton County, one of the \"warp suicides.\"\n\n1895. Eight members of the Bisbee-Bennett family \u2014 white-sounding neighbors, were killed in a mass suicide, in a sign of more deaths in the West.\n\n1899. Pawnee blood on a church cornerstone is offered as a sure sign that Christianity is born. This term for Pawnee-Christianity is attributed to a pious minister in early 1900s.\n\n1922. Son of Pawnee leader John Moriarty, Inman Burney begins a new effort to revive the Pawnee tribe in southwest Oklahoma. More than a century later, he and his wife lead four generations of Pawnee across the plains of the Smoky Mountains.\n\n1995. Celebrated survivor Robin Burns became one of America's leading advocates and champions of the Southwest's six million native people.\n\n1996.

After his fate became known, the meteoric Fumusa storehouse-sunstone subsequently cast some shaft of icy-fire into his heart, and at the termination of a long life-time, he ceased to speak.\n\nOne of the companions among some people from the mother of the gods is the steaming-head frost (Slitt); he has been driven from the North in pursuit of some magical bird, and his communication with his companions is invariably cut off during an unsuccessful exercise.

His name means \"Slayer of Alien Gods,\" from an\u00e1, alien; ye, gods; ag\u00e1n?, to kill. By him, with the assistance of Tobadz?sch\u00ed?n?, his twin brother, were killed numerous bird, animal, rock, and human monsters, typifying evils, who wantonly destroyed human life.\n\nWhen the Spirit People came upon this earth from below they made six sacred mountains, four on the distant horizon at the cardinal points and two in the centre, Ch\u00f3?li and Tz?lhn\u00fahod?\u00edhl?. On the eastern slope of Ch\u00f3?li, brought forth as the daughter of Earth and Sky, was born Y\u00f3lkai Ests\u00e1n, White-Shell Woman. First Man took her to his home near Tz?lhn\u00fahod?hl?, where she matured in twelve days into a beautiful woman with supernatural powers. Later she lived in a home of her own at the foot of this mountain. It was while there that she gave birth to twin boys who became saviours of their people, slaying alien gods who were fast depopulating the earth.\n\nY\u00f3lkai Ests\u00e1n would often lie on the eastern slope of the mountain as the sun rose through the morning, and when the day grew warm would seek the shade of jutting rocks from which trickled shining drops of water. Quite unknown to herself she had conceived one day from the sunbeams and the dripping water. When she became aware that she was to become a mother Y\u00f3lkai ?sts\u00e1n was made very happy, for she did not enjoy living alone. Soon she found herself the proud possessor of twin boys. The first-born and the stronger came to be known in his youth as Nay\u00e9?n?zgan?, Slayer of Alien Gods; the other was always known as Tobadz?sch\u00ed?n?, Born From Water. Their prenatal life covered a period of only twelve days, and maturity was attained in thirty-two days after passing through eight changes, one of which came every four days.\n\nAt that time the earth was infested with great giants, foreign gods, who were rapidly destroying the people. Of these, Y\u00e9?tso, Big God, as large as a mountain, was the only one in human[pg 099] form. The others were Man-eating Bird, Rolling Stone, that crushed all in its path, Tracking Bear, and Antelope, who killed without mercy. Fearing lest some of these monsters learn of the presence of her boys, Y\u00f3lkai ?sts\u00e1n kept them hidden away on the mountain side, but they chafed under confinement, so she made them bows and arrows and let them play about, but admonished them not to stray far from home. The boys promised to obey, but not long afterward, because in reply to their questions their mother told them she did not know who their father was, they became sulky and broke their promise, going off toward the east. They would go and search for someone who knew. When on a small knoll a long way from home they heard a whispered \"Sh-h.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid, my younger brother?\" asked Nay\u00e9?n?zgan?.\n\n\"No!\" was the quick response.\n\nFour times they heard the whisper, and then two of the Wind People appeared. \"We saw you travelling eastward,\" said they, \"and came to caution you.

Alas, we know nothing of him and are now starting on a search to learn.

{"eta": "This week, the management group overseeing Germany's N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife moved to ban manufacturers from attempting and publishing timed laps on the famed, 13-mile endurance race track.\n\nThe move has raised security concerns.\n\nThe N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife management company, which was the central proponent of the crackdown, is called STR (Strasse des Wegtechnik, or STR): a German acronym for the private body responsible for enforcing the code among the manufacturers.\n\nIt is managed by the regulatory body, not by Porsche. For this reason, it said, the ban is not yet legally binding.\n\nThe cars could still be used, however.\n\nStr said several days ago that it could suspend the racing category: \"We may need a few days,\" said Wolfgang Maier, head of the Str group of companies in a weekly news conference. \"This has been under consideration of us for a while.\"\n\nA Porsche spokesperson declined to comment, saying a company spokesperson wouldn't comment on legal matters.\n\nPOLICE AGAINST IMPORTANCE\n\nWith its track longer than several football fields, the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife can be one of the most dangerous places for drivers, with no sidewalks or sidewalks marked, and in spite of multiple waves of police patrols over the past decade. In October 2002, a car of Belgian hit-and-run driver Guy Cavallena crashed at the bottom of the mountain after veering off the road.\n\nPolice are trying to close the gap between the N\u00fcrburgring's wild unpredictability and the safety of the drivers it accommodates. That work started with the arrival of six large gendarmes in 2001 who patrol the race track's nine, often lonely and intense, corners.\n\n\"It's important to reduce the odds that a car can get there without stopping,\" says Lt. Roman Lamos, the division head of the motor sports police in Germany.\n\nHis regular patrol patrol, he tells CNN, hasn't been without mishaps in the past years. It took him three attempts last year to break up a fight that broke out about 30 metres off the track, one of the few areas where the cars are not under heavy police scrutiny. \"They've really tightened up the area,\" he says.\n\nFewer officials have been allowed to patrol the Nordschleife with N\u00fcrburgring N\u00fcrburgring safety officials and the German air traffic controller (SURF) station at the Hermitage in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\nOne key step was adopting a new approach to issues like speed limits and safety corridors, says Lamos. New technology has allowed technicians to run the car as if it weren't controlled by a GPS, no matter how close a car is to the motorway.\n\nThe car doesn't need to meet the FIA's annual record average speed of 160.5 kilometres per hour, which defines the official speed limit.\n\nA 900,000-euro prize awaits manufacturers who can develop the most advanced technology to meet these limits.\n\nCar makers with a manufacturer's license may run with 55 kilometers of maximum top speed at the Nordschleife, 75 kilometers at the N\u00fcrburgring or 100 kilometers at the Scheidl-sills Circuit in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, depending on the age, model and models they want to promote.\n\nIt doesn't, however, mean an automatic re-license.\n\n\"In our system, a new race can only be taken by a manufacturer's license if there's absolutely no risk that the entire road network is closed off to the public,\" Lamos says.\n\nDr. Steve Schumacher had been trying to run the same car when it ran again, he says.\n\n\"My mission here was to really consolidate that data,\" a retired veterinarian and highly respected race car driver says of the dune buggy race. \"I didn't feel I was the product of this, this alone.\"\n\nSchumacher wasn't happy with his 2015 results, he says. \"But because I'd done the absolute best I could, I was determined to go back with even better results.\"\n\nSuch heartbreak has not dissuaded everyone from participating in this test.\n\n\"The Nordschleife is crazy as it is,\" says retired race car driver Louis Braitenberg.\n\nEven if the manufacturers can't run the new cars, all the N\u00fcrburgring will need is technology improvements, for all its elimination racing.\n\nIn order to do so, Braitenberg says, manufacturers could simply invent an \"automated path\" between the cars they want to replace.\n\nSafety upgrades aside, the management group's security measures have raised concerns in parts of the world where N\u00fcrburgring is popular with tourists.\n\nEarlier this year, the Bavarian governor, Horst Seehofer,", "topp": "This week, the management group overseeing Germany's N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife moved to ban manufacturers from attempting and publishing timed laps on the famed, 13-mile circuit due to its \"dangerous, dangerous traffic\" and dangerous high-speed corners. A Dutch group that creates content for BMW's online services has also been banned over an excerpt about women drive around an antigravity course on the same Circuit.\n\nUntil Tuesday, these two companies, which each rely heavily on event advertising, were allowed to split cost of covering events at the Nordschleife with the public.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the German authorities said the Nordschleife's \"inducement, course, and speed\" should be made an area of public concern and the meeting should be made public, Inb4 cars parked at every corner.\n\nThe likely response from French, UK and some American executives of these big auto brands -- BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen -- would surely be the same when all cars everywhere are being ordered to turn away from red lights and slow to 15 mph or less -- inevitably linked to global warming.\n\nIronically, it would be harsh on the Europeans who buy about 70 percent of the most deadly auto cars on the planet but the still manage to sell privately for one reason. And they are not -- if not for carbon emissions -- exempt from there being no concerted attack on their erratic traffic patterns by German authorities.\n\nUnder a deal signed in October 2012, BMW and the new authorities in Germany said the Bonneville now will be made 30 percent greener through improved heating and cooling systems and the payouts will be adjusted as cars increase the average speed they travel (the standard Bonneville will now go up 2 mph a year or 5 percent).\n\nThey are being mocked for trying to tell the German people what to do -- but all have failed for all too apparent details to be convinced as truly at odds with their own methods, for not deterring the $8.7 trillion Volkswagen diesel scandal and one of the highest-level laps worldwide in recent history.\n\nOf course the plan was intended to mitigate the latest environmental disaster, Volkswagen. The company is now the subject of a wide-ranging class action and admitted that illegal software -- software that likely contributed to billions of dollars in vehicle emissions violations nationwide -- allowed the cars to drive on the amount of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions nearly five times higher than the legal limit to increase fuel economy. Diesel cars, as what they do might now be called, can easily pass these vehicles in real-world conditions.\n\nThe new rules allow the changing of the upper limit under stricter standards than were used in France, Germany, Italy, the UK, the U.S. and many other countries.\n\nInstead, the Nurburgring is being modified to protect \"speeding and accident-prone traffic,\" which is not standard practice, but made official by the annual update of the safety circuit. The careful change has been lauded by all players in the world of motorsports.\n\nBut little green diesels are already banning fast runs near Bonneville.\n\nOfficially, the manufacturer of the production vehicle runs at a normal speed of 156 mph, but the electric features roll over, may be just within $4 million of the allowable speed and operate at a cruise speed of 186 mph. This gives 80 mph as a zone to overtake.\n\nIn September, German motor manufacturer BMW was fined $10.2 million by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency after failing to accurately monitor its sales of diesel, diesel hybrid and electric cars that sometimes went faster than advertised or exceeded qualifying limits to test.\n\nThe test, which has been cited for air quality violations from Colorado to Germany, is our own interpretation, as well as the thought of many who review our coverage of car safety. We run the test four times a year -- mustering 74 mph tests to be within a problem zone.\n\nSince we don't buy our cars from the U.S. International Auto Exchange, the pound exchange, as they call it in New York, we trade the carbon dioxide emissions of diesel cars for the nitrogen oxide emissions we pay a car title insurance company. We often have to account for the increased mileage in miles per gallon as they went from 40 mpg in 1971 to the EPA set rate of 50 mpg.\n\nThe American Automobile Association estimates that 40 percent of vehicles pulled over at the bottom of the curve early this month were capable of 100 mph (161 km/h) not exceeding the world's legal limit. And 40 percent of the crash damage in those instances was caused by the engine power in those cars.\n\nMake sure you exercise extra caution when going at any speed. The top speed allowed in France is 130 mph (220 km/h). Forget racing down the paces at a race track with a conservative head speed.\n\nAnd remember the fine print: 100 mph and above, and those with programming, double", "human": "This week, the management group overseeing Germany's N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife moved to ban manufacturers from attempting and publishing timed laps on the famed, 13-mile course. For car enthusiasts who judge modern sports cars by how quickly they can round the circuit, it's an unthinkable, if not wholly unexpected, turn of events.\n\nFor Christian Von Koenigsegg, it's even more disappointing; the news comes just days before he was to spend a week at the circuit with the new Koenigsegg One:1 hypercar in hopes of setting a lap record. It's part of Koenigsegg's three-year plan to establish the One:1 as the fastest production car in the world.\n\nIt was early Tuesday morning when I received an urgent phone call from Christian. In two days, I was to jump on a plane with my team to capture the Koenigsegg lap-time effort for our upcoming 4K documentary, APEX, which we're producing in conjunction with Sony. This is the final chapter in a storyline that follows the past three years of auto manufacturers battling it out for technological dominance in producing halo cars for the next decade, cars including the Porsche 918, McLaren P1, and Ferrari LaFerrari. All have shown what they're worth on the track, but the Koenigsegg One:1 has yet to do so.\n\nNow we have a new story to tell: The N\u00fcrburgring benchmark of sports-car superiority has come to a screeching halt, and the Koenigsegg One:1's place on the leaderboard is in jeopardy. We'd been on stand-by to fly across the Atlantic (on moments' notice) to capture Koenigsegg's attempt. This time, helicopter crews were ready to go, logistics were sorted, and travel was booked. The sudden notification from N\u00fcrburgring management couldn't have come at a more inopportune moment for everyone.\n\nThe decision to ban timed laps stems from an accident earlier this year at a VLN race, involving driver Jann Mardenborough, in which a spectator was killed. Track management reacted by imposing a speed limit at Flugplatz, where the crash occurred. Since then, management has imposed further restrictions in other high-speed sectors. This is a particularly disappointing development for Koenigsegg, since the One:1's flat-out speed in those sectors would likely have given it a lap-time advantage. In Tiergarten, for instance, a long, fast section where Christian estimates the One:1 could easily hit 300 kph, speed is now restricted to just 200 kph.\n\nOfficial word from Nurburgring management is that these restrictions will be reviewed at the end of the year, but for the time being, manufacturers like Koenigsegg are banned from attempting lap-time runs \u2014 even if they've rented out the entire track for themselves. The Koenigsegg team and the One:1 are now stuck in a holding pattern. They have a car that's ready to attack the northern loop. Their simulations and data suggest they've got a good chance to best their competitors. Even Koenigsegg's past track data suggests their best segment times, when stitched together, would undercut the Porsche 918's official 6:57 time by double-digit seconds.\n\nBut there's a twist to the story. After the initial restrictions were in place, Lamborghini ran its new Aventador SV and published a sub-seven-minute lap time. N\u00fcrburgring management claims Lamborghini's attempt happened one day before they issued the latest round of restrictions. Yet at the same time, WTCC laps have been allowed to ignore all speed limits all together? What's the deal? We're investigating.\n\nSo what's next for Koenigsegg and our film, APEX? The helicopter crews are ready, the One:1 is ready, but we don't have anywhere to run the car.\n\nIs there a new benchmark to be set? Should nearby Spa Francorchamps, another long, high-speed track with motorsports provenance, become the new venue for lap time tests? Maybe a stateside circuit like the four-mile West Grand course at VIR would fit the bill? What about setting an endurance record?

{"eta": "Preferring composition isn't just about polymorphism. Although that is part of it, and you are right that (at least in nominally typed languages) what people really do is argue about the superior or inferior mixin/monad. (Of course, these things are basically specific to certain types of languages, but that's not what makes the debate. What makes the debate is that we're picking naturality because that's what everyone seems to want at once, and then getting to a point in history where it's \"allowed\" to redefine something like combinators all the time, but that is simply a fantasy. Because of this, we're averse to it, and to that extent I'm right (what's your take on the expression 'it should be possible to define general typed combinators that look pretty much like the Haskell combinators'?) Maybe as people get used to knowing what is generally wanted they decide to abandon this desire for as-syntax, but I think it will be a long time before that happens.)\n\nCannot-use-monoid-designating-class :\n\nBarry Kaye :\n\nWe want (e.g.) to define infix operator r, and we don't want to give R a sigil that can be called infix r' or infix r'', but we can never know that for sure from the constraints for R.\n\nBertrand Hoppe :\n\nThe short answer is: \"in the end every datatype R has a somewhat unspecified relation to the other datatypes. I wish I could avoid this problem too, but the road is long. When we define a datatype R we expect to be able to easily store some computation that takes the information we want out of R and turns it into its own data.\n\nWhat will be allowed:\n\nSome adjunction: R' [R + R](R)! R + R' [R + R + (R-R)] : {R}, {R'}!\n\nLambdas which are not brandable: all data types can have functions which take their arguments, which aren't brandable.\n\nAll instances of the apply function : apply (r :: R) (r -> r') :: R. These are forbidden.\n\nIn all cases, but not limited to monoid types, f and g must have constant type signatures. Exceptions may be made for some schemes, e.g. lift :: Monoid a => SInt -> a -> a -> a, but in general every data type as per IORefs 2.1 must have a way of that constraint.\n\nTreat each datatype R as being a separate type.\n\nInstead of this:\n\nforall k. forall a. f :: (k -> a) -> R -> R a :: k! k = f! k! a\n\nyou could add\n\nforall a. f :: x -> x -> R a :: x! x = f! x = g! g! a\n\nand that would be right and natural.\n\nThere are ambiguities here. For instance, if I try to define a general instance for FIO then I could use a safe pair in the right place. But one possible next move is to define that pair with monoid-specialisation to get a type where something like :: FIO a => R -> R' a.\n\nBut this wouldn't be OK. I suppose if your point of view is that R has a polymorphic datatype function g? Then f :: (x -> a) -> f x can be applied to R a and that is why R and g are allowed, and you would have to impose on their syntax and the associated interfaces that R still has such things too, but the syntax to do something like f x1 x2 = g2 x1 y2 = g1 y1 y2 = f x1 x2 would be restricted to R x1 y1 x2 => g2 x1 y1 => f x1 x2. So then our choice was made between reducing them to a system that also treated R and g exactly like (and optionally ignored) monotonics, or preferring to give them their names without the two constraints about using monoid-specialisation. Either way, it would be rather awkward, and that is a fact I feel.\n\nInstead there would be an unrestricted:\n\nforall k. f :: R k => k -> R f :: (k -> r) -> R k -> R f x = R l f :: (k -> x) -> R k -> R f x = (R x) f x = rf x\n\nThe f :: R x => (k -> x) -> R x is defined thusly: the lift function f x = rf x and hence the semantics of the constraint are given by (1)", "topp": "Preferring composition isn't just about polymorphism. Although that is part of it, and you are right that (at least in nominally typed languages) what people really want is to be able to add to that standard library, there is a lot more under the hood that needs to be rethought in order to make this work.\n\nOne of the big concerns here is that pure Racket is notoriously difficult to build, so you'd expect to encounter that. And when you have to fight with your editor to write your code, it's hard to see how you'd get any clarity about what is acceptable. But truth is, the defining experience of Clojure is simply not doing these things and making them as pleasant to use as possible, and if you've been to a Clojure conference and met someone or is a Clojure programmer you certainly know what a pain it is to do any of them properly.\n\nSo this is rather a bit of a stumbling block, especially with libraries from two languages like that you don't usually see. But ultimately, we're eager to solve the problem that clojurejocks provides. But there's nothing preventing you from writing the same extra code with Jokers, which is far simpler and far more concise than a complete novel of taking care of exception handling, networking, documentation, diagnostics, and wrappers around native APIs on the JVM, and attempting to make it all work on JVM on the JVM on the JVM on the JVM. Doing this requires only monotone code: making sure that if you try to do something wrong, you don't do it anywhere else. In other words, you make sure that your second-class citizens are forced to check into your code.\n\nI wonder whether one could get away with doing this, and another way to mitigate the pain of dealing with exceptions is to force the check into your code if needed to avoid going into compile-time errors. For example, if you have some with rangeCheck, you can test it with these two lines of code\n\n( ns my-classes ( :require [jokers.immutable-numbers :as mut]) ( :use [jokers.close-quicksort :only-if] [jokers.intranet :only-if]) ( :use [jokers.polyfill :only-if] [clojure.spec :only-if] [clojure.util :only-if]) ( defn ^:export search [v] ( condp v (.omit :search )) ( be ( or v nil ) ( find v)))) ( defn search2 [v] ( fn [f search-string] ( if ( nil? search-string) ( throw ( str/unexec search-string) ( error \"found :search not found\" )) f search-string)) ( search2 search-string \"foo\" ) ; => (MPSET 14034679787521628)\n\nHowever, this highlights two different ways in which this could be written, one that's easier to write, and one that isn't. There is also a loose relationship between these two solutions. More as our problem stands, it's not clear to me that the tedious code we get here is really solving the primary problem of our application.\n\n( ns my-classes ( :require [jokers.immutable-numbers :as mut]) ( :use [jokers.close-quicksort :only-if] [jokers.intranet :only-if]) ( :use [jokers.polyfill :only-if] [clojure.spec :only-if] [clojure.util :only-if]) ( let [pop ( mutate-in2 search-string) range-asserts ( mutate-in2 search-string) non-exported-methods ( mutate-in2 search-string) override-instructions ( mutate-in2 search-string)] ( assoc pair pair map readrs scopes ( lower clojure.spec.clojure.spec/clj-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/std-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/seq-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/builder-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/map-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/constraints clojure.spec.clojure.spec/list-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/import-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/streams-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/simple-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/destruct-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/exports env declarations)) ( defn round [context object count] ( if ( :seq (.clj-arg? count)) ( ^Exception ( get and", "human": "Preferring composition isn't just about polymorphism. Although that is part of it, and you are right that (at least in nominally typed languages) what people really mean is \"prefer a combination of composition and interface implementation.\" But, the reasons to prefer composition (in many circumstances) are profound.\n\nPolymorphism is about one thing behaving multiple ways. So, generics/templates are a \"polymorphic\" feature in so far as they allow a single piece of code to vary its behavior with types. In-fact, this type of polymorphism is really the best behaved and is generally referred to as parametric polymorphism because the variation is defined by a parameter.\n\nMany languages provide a form of polymorphism called \"overloading\" or ad hoc polymorphism where multiple procedures with the same name are defined in an ad hoc manner, and where one is chosen by the language (perhaps the most specific). This is the least well behaved kind of polymorphism, since nothing connects the behavior of the two procedures except developed convention.\n\nA third kind of polymorphism is subtype polymorphism. Here a procedure defined on a given type, can also work on a whole family of \"subtypes\" of that type. When you implement an interface or extend a class you are generally declaring your intention to create a subtype. True subtypes are governed by Liskov's Substitution Principle, which says that if you can prove something about all objects in a supertype you can prove it about all instances in a subtype. Life gets dangerous though, since in languages like C++ and Java, people generally have unenforced, and often undocumented assumptions about classes which may or may not be true about their subclasses. That is, code is written as if more is provable than it really is, which produces a whole host of issues when you subtype carelessly.\n\nInheritance is actually independent of polymorphism. Given some thing \"T\" which has a reference to itself, inheritance happens when you create a new thing \"S\" from \"T\" replacing \"T\"s reference to itself with a reference to \"S\". That definition is intentionally vague, since inheritance can happen in many situations, but the most common is subclassing an object which has the effect of replacing the this pointer called by virtual functions with the this pointer to the subtype.\n\nInheritance is a dangerous like all very powerful things inheritance has the power to cause havoc. For example, suppose you override a method when inheriting from some class: all is well and good until some other method of that class assumes the method you inherit to behave a certain way, after all that is how the author of the original class designed it. You can partially protect against this by declaring all methods called by another of your methods private or non-virtual (final), unless they are designed to be overridden. Even this though isn't always good enough. Sometimes you might see something like this (in pseudo Java, hopefully readable to C++ and C# users)\n\ninterface UsefulThingsInterface { void doThings(); void doMoreThings(); } ... class WayOfDoingUsefulThings implements UsefulThingsInterface{ private foo stuff; public final int getStuff(); void doThings(){ //modifies stuff, such that ... ... } ... void doMoreThings(){ //ignores stuff ... } }\n\nyou think this is lovely, and have your own way of doing \"things\", but you use inheritance to acquire the ability to do \"moreThings\",\n\nclass MyUsefulThings extends WayOfDoingUsefulThings{ void doThings { //my way } }\n\nAnd all is well and good. WayOfDoingUsefulThings was designed in such a way that replacing one method doesn't change the semantics of any other... except wait, no it wasn't. It just looks like it was, but doThings changed mutable state that mattered. So, even though it didn't call any override-able functions,\n\nvoid dealWithStuff(WayOfDoingUsefulThings bar){ bar.doThings() use(bar.getStuff()); }\n\nnow does something different than expected when you pass it a MyUsefulThings . Whats worse, you might not even know that WayOfDoingUsefulThings made those promises. Maybe dealWithStuff comes from the same library as WayOfDoingUsefulThings and getStuff() isn't even exported by the library (think of friend classes in C++). Worse still, you have defeated the static checks of the language without realizing it: dealWithStuff took a WayOfDoingUsefulThings just to make sure that it would have a getStuff() function that behaved a certain way.\n\nUsing composition\n\nclass MyUsefulThings implements UsefulThingsInterface{ private way = new WayOfDoingUsefulThings() void doThings() { //my way } void doMoreThings() { this", "eta_suffix": " R l f :: (k -> x) -> R k -> R f x = (R x) f x = rf x\n\nThe f :: R x => (k -> x) -> R x is defined thusly: the lift function f x = rf x and hence the semantics of the constraint are given by (1)", "topp_suffix": "args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/simple-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/destruct-args clojure.spec.clojure.spec/exports env declarations)) ( defn round [context object count] ( if ( :seq (.clj-arg? count)) ( ^Exception ( get and", "gold_suffix": "OfDoingUsefulThings just to make sure that it would have a getStuff() function that behaved a certain way.\n\nUsing composition\n\nclass MyUsefulThings implements UsefulThingsInterface{ private way = new WayOfDoingUsefulThings() void doThings() { //my way } void doMoreThings() { this", "prefix": "Preferring composition isn't just about polymorphism.

Vereshchagin, who was one of two organizations featured in the movie \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" says he and his allies have been successful at thwarting both the environmental movement and the upstart lobbying coalition known as Save the Economy. \"So far, we have not been successful with both,'' he says in an interview from Vancouver, where he recently completed a study for International Crisis Group on Canada's oil industry.

We were the only industrialized nation to produce this amount from its midsection in an American country, and we are the only one with this much. In part, this is a combination of producing large volumes of the fuel, but also a growing portion of the tar sands. More and more, we now import oil to prop up this industry. It's an improbable situation.\n\n\nPetroleum by the truckload: 5 things to know (Jan 11, 2005)\n\nWestern Canada is the bedrock of Canada's petroleum system. The 773 gas wells along the 850 km of the Great Lakes Pipeline. The 30 crude oil tankers anchored in St. James Harbour. The approximately 1,000 oil and gas rigs operating on the Outer Continental Shelf. We may be behind the curve, but we're not out of this game yet.\n\n\nThe \"Motive Curve\": Oil's sticky rhythm (Jan 4, 2005)\n\nPetroleum is anything but predictable, especially in the heat of the moment. When OPEC sent its diplomat, Mohammed ben Arif, to the United Nations Environment, Food and Agriculture Organization to argue the case for a non-binding effort to cut excess global emissions, in September 2005, an international plan to raise standards for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, especially from land-based sources and from power plants, was to be born. Every year that passed without action on this issue brought more carbon dioxide emissions, and the emission market for oil-fired power plants in the United States crumbled.\n\nMore reading: Environmental organizations' lessons from the failed U.S. climate change negotiations (Feb 16, 2005)\n\nOil Prices Over The Counter in Context (Feb 1, 2005)\n\nGlobal oil prices have fallen for over two decades, which is leading to speculation that producers\n\nwould repatriate their oil to the U.S. or some other central North American jurisdiction where oil prices would remain stable and\n\nhome production would remain at record levels. This perspective relies on an assumption that if oil prices rise no production cuts or regulatory rollbacks are possible. As these relationships become more obvious, however, it appears that just such an outcome is unlikely.\n\nPrice drops: will oil prices level off? (Nov 14, 2004)\n\nLecturers John Dolan, Paul Rice, and Professor Ramon Magri are joined by Wall Street analyst Deirdre McCloskey as they explore what might happen in 2008 if oil prices dropped substantially. The interviews are designed to provide a transparent history of the factors that have kept the oil price low, and the fundamentals that may prevent a collapse. During each of the nine interviews, financial analyst Kevin O'Reilly interviews analysts and their experts in the three leading oil exporting countries. The production fundamentals suggest that once one country has finished extracting the first barrel, there will be no more deliveries from the remainder of the world. Their findings also suggest that over time the production of U.S. shale is beginning to increase output in western Canada.

Those searching for a line of continuity are desperately looking for something that augurs good news about the direction of parliamentary democracy in Canada. And while the Harper Conservatives have quite a few key fights to fight, none are as good as this one.\n\nThe first is over some of the deeply troubling legacies of Laurier's administration. Let's deal with them one at a time.\n\nThe Conservatives have banned first ministers from all but the most initial decisions about policy, which continues to be a bone of contention with Judy Foote and is now being challenged again by Joe Oliver. Aside from any obvious constitutional issues, Canada's first ministers, like all MPs, would have always been able to persuade cabinet to pass these types of measures.\n\nAppearing at a meeting of the Senate committee this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper were asked how he could justify these religious obscenities at the heart of what is supposed to be a secular program.\n\n\"And we have to be very clear,\" Harper told The Globe and Mail.\n\nFor years, those conservatives who make up the niqab-testing movement have fought to exclude the evidence of an imam in a public delivery of religion. Harper, and the hearing he conducted on religious beliefs before the Senate Committee from the niqab-testing movement's standpoint, were able to use some illogical and Kafkaesque reasoning.\n\nHarper's secret ballot argument goes like this. A member of Parliament, who objects to niqabs in public places, can vote to keep the imam's evidence in public, even though he refuses to let her to present that evidence. Assuming both sides agree to this, what makes the NDP position correct? There were only three parties who preferred there be no evidence presented at all?\n\nHarper denied this secret ballot argument. While no doubt there are some second and third party candidates in the Senate but, according to Harper, there are first time caucus members there. He also avoided answering simple questions about how he determined Senate candidates, and none of his answers did much to dispel the idea that Harper's vote would probably turn out the way the NDP's vote might.\n\nWe will attempt to discuss the secret ballot argument in a bit more depth, but it should not come as any shock to anyone that it did not work. Either party has enough votes to pick the person whose secret ballot is used, and does not lose any to save the parliamentary integrity of the democracy. In the 2005 election the Conservative Party won the Senate vote with 91 seats. That was thanks to Alison Redford's deciding to stay in. In 2008 Harper's Conservatives won 95 seats, but because they lost four seats, I gather that they have not made much of an effort to improve that number. The internal war within the party this week shows how hard that really is.\n\nThe Conservative Party has been exceptionally resistant to address some of its deeplegacies. While most of the hon. members of the House of Commons do not face an ongoing conflict with a second chamber, many of them do, from Louise Mindyn to Bruce Hyer to the former justice minister.\n\nAfter they spoke with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on the previous day over differences over the Senate, Prime Minister Stephen Harper handed Prime Minister Bill English a letter last month so that he could not use his magic wand and start reconfiguring the Senate.\n\nAsserting that senators are independent of partisan interests, Harper accused Mr. Trudeau of trying to get rid of the Senate as we know it. When Mr. Harper asked Mr. Trudeau to see Mr. English's letter in advance of May's referendum on constitutional reform, Mr. Trudeau refused.\n\n\"We're not going to do that,\" Mr. Trudeau said after the debate.\n\nWith Mr. Trudeau citing the Constitution, which gives him power to change or abolish the Senate, Mr. Harper replied: \"Unfortunately, I cannot.\"\n\nThe Conservatives refused to debate this point, having lumped Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Liberal Leader Bob Rae and the NDP with another regular Quebec Member of Parliament that Mr. Harper knows very well, Liberal Senator Michael Bryant. Mr. Bryant, who supports something as normal as recognizing first nations as a minority society, is considered by those on the right to be a \"liberal\" by way of early 20th century, progressive Quebec colonialist.\n\nMr. Bryant testified on stage, with his right to display the niqab as proof of religion in public equal to others' constitutionally protected access to the title of Prince of Wales as a hereditary office holder. The Senate seat he has will likely go to the Conservatives.\n\nHarper officials also denied a request from Globe reporter William Lane Craig to brief the Governor General on the continuous process of reaching the zero question in the Senate.

Last week, according to CBC TV's Environmental Unit , \"\u2026five scientists from high-profile U.S. universities and NASA released a scathing critique of Canada's cuts to its ozone monitoring, saying it is jeopardizing the world's ability to watch for holes in the ozone layer and pollutants high in the atmosphere.\"\n\nBut beyond the contempt shown for the international community, the deliberate sabotage of ozone monitoring again demonstrates two of the most prominent features of the Harper government: its disdain and even hostility towards science (and its own scientists) and its determination to promote the oil industry and protect it from any possible criticism.\n\nIt is not just ozone monitoring that has been gutted. In a response to the revelation Environment Canada acknowledged that other pollutants-monitoring was also being downgraded: \"The number of staff in measurement activities for the monitoring of ozone, tropospheric pollution and atmospheric transport of toxic chemicals has remained constant but their work now includes other departmental priorities.\"\n\nTropospheric pollution is essentially pollution particles caused by combustion \u2013 industrial, automobile, forest fires, etc. \u2013 the kind of pollution that is the most dangerous to human health.\n\nThe same day that the revelations about the Conservatives' cuts to pollution monitoring were published, an article in the New York Times reported on several new studies that revealed living in polluted air is even more hazardous to your health than previously thought. One study found that air breathed by most Americans (it's hardly any different in Canadian cities) \"\u2026greatly accelerates declines in measures of memory and attention span.\" A study in Boston concluded that the odds of having a stroke increased by 30 per cent even on days when pollution was classified as moderate \u2013 a category that is supposed to suggest minimal danger to health. It went up to 60% for bad pollution days and the effects were almost immediate \u2013 within 12-14 hours.\n\nA study published in the American Journal of Medicine revealed that common pollutants \u2013 carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide \u2013 \"\u2026raised a person's immediate risk of suffering a heart attack..\", increasing heart rates and thickening the blood, accelerating the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nWhy would any government deliberately take steps that they know will make it more difficult to protect the health of its citizens? A health Canada report published in 2005 concluded that 6,000 people a year in Canada died as a direct result of air pollution and that the health costs of that pollution were a billion dollars a year.\n\nBut the Harper government's priority is not the health of Canadians or the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. Its single-minded purpose is to promote the oil industry and protect it from any criticism. Demonizing critics of the tar sands as enemies of the country is just one small part of that goal. Eliminating scientific data that could link the oil industry to negative health effects is another. Why else would the government stop monitoring for pollution?\n\nIf the message is giving you trouble, shoot the messengers. That's exactly what Harper has done and will continue to do in his March budget. Last fall Environment Canada announced that some 700 scientists and researchers would be losing their jobs. Sixty were fired in January.\n\nMURRAY DOBBIN, now living in Powell River, BC has been a journalist, broadcaster, author and social activist for over forty years.

{"eta": "Has Dyson's robotic dream become a reality?\n\nHas Dyson finally cracked its 16-year mission to create a robot vacuum cleaner? The company's teaser video hints at just that, even going so far as to drive the central vacuum cleaner through the streets of Seattle (without some fantastically elaborate trolley trick, of course.)\n\n\"When you think of a vacuum cleaner, it's probably a piece of junk, but how much of an appliance can you really substitute for something better, and then other people don't steal it?\" says Dyson's Martin VanderWerff. \"You can start to see that what we were hoping for, what we planned, what we believed was going to go on, is happening.\"\n\nSo is this the real deal? The photo below is of a prototype vacuum cleaner from 1991, when Dyson wanted to show off to clients a brand new future.\n\nThat's the stuff of sci-fi. There's no question Dyson wants to make a clean, sanitary vacuum, but it isn't the same company it once was. When the company first met with Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, he wanted to make a vacuum \"for home.\" Later, when trying to sell the same model (also known as the \"1.0\") online, Dyson sold a couple of prototypes to Wired, Salon, and Discover Magazine, a surprising number of which\u2014like all Dyson machines\u2014were vacuum cleaners. With the drowsy glamor of an ultralight \"adult cinema,\" in other words, it was obvious to Dyson that this wasn't a full-fledged product launch. But the results of the independent, dare I say \"rare\" reviews and testimonials and early proofs-of-concept videos reveal this isn't a one-shot \"lift up the curtain\" deal (as Bezos' critics often seem to feel a vacuum cleaner needs to be).\n\nThe promise of vacuum cleaner vacuums, it turns out, is harder than Bezos had originally feared. While Bezos stumped the \"Halo Wars\" fanboys when he announced that he'd purchased the videogame publisher from Microsoft for $970 million (before depreciation), Dyson ended up working closely with both companies\u2014presumably on exclusive production of the vacuum cleaner design. A 2013 redesign of the 1.0 was finished this year by Dyson\u2014but the portability of the brand and its overall low price for mass market sales were, and are still, hotly contested.\n\n\"We've made real progress in improving things,\" VanderWerff says. \"Our vacuums are much more compact in general than they were. We've improved the ride quality in our vacuums\u2014particularly around your face, where the bump up in ride height and braking takes some pressure off you. It's definitely not a perfect vacuum, and we'll get better and better with a little bit of focus.\"\n\nOne of the features VanderWerff is best known for, the gum-covered handlebar controls, were \"ejected from the vacuum cleaner,\" he says, and are the reason for recent delays, one of which was related to a tough plastic issue. And yet he's happy with the design. \"We have picked it up just as much as it was pulled from our vacuum,\" says VanderWerff, who's still hard at work on the final version. \"I don't have to make this vacuum any more, and I know that will be beneficial for the future of the brand.\"\n\nRisky but Progressing\n\nAccording to VanderWerff, even though vacuum cleaners are a product group that has had its ups and downs in recent years, Dyson still has an early lead, and that means the company has no use for advances in technology other than to improve it in some minor, non-historic manner. For example, Dyson says it used to use a head-mounted infrared camera to \"see\" your vehicle in the car's interior, but then Dyson's patented \"InfraRed Eyes\" technology dropped in power to you know where. According, to VanderWerff, this didn't make a lot of sense for a vacuum cleaner, but now that a robot vacuum isn't required for all parking lots and installations, Dyson sees the move as a logical next step.\n\nDyson's latest acquisition, SeaGoblin, isn't used around the world\u2014it's the product used to populate a chip-equipped TV sitcom, called The Gadgetians. But Dyson did have \"over one hundred years of design experience\" at the time of its merger with Telex, and now, after a couple of delays, is still \"fucking doing it.\" It doesn't have as much (or any) data crunching capabilities, it's limited to motors and a few drive units, and still doesn't even have a cellular network. All this is to say that it's not just a product that needs some time to mature.\n\nBut", "topp": "Has Dyson's robotic dream become a reality?\n\nHas Dyson finally cracked its 16-year mission to create a robot vacuum cleaner? The company's teaser video hints that it has succeeded, with a sweeping journey down a corridor covered in dense on-board electronic and mechanical circuitry that the narrator insists \"should enable it to do in less than four minutes what would take a small infant a month.\"\n\nBut at the end of this 4\u00bd minute documentary video, the narrator points to one surprise: the robot brings the same level of practicality and fun and zero-effort optimism we all want from these commercial technologies. Like human grandchildren. In less than four minutes.\n\nFor now, Dyson is focused on transitioning its breakthrough robotic vacuum cleaner to manufacturing. This fall, the company won a $165 million construction contract with Beijing Automotive (another Chinese automotive giant), according to Shenzhen's state-run Xinhua news agency. Dyson hopes to complete the manufacturing move by 2020, potentially with a truck that can drive 500 kilometers (3 miles) on its battery-powered charge.\n\nHere are five numbers to watch and tweet about as Dyson sues the United States, China, Germany and Japan to stop its impending manufacturing move.\n\n1) Does Dyson make commercial version?\n\nMany of us have wondered if Dyson has made a commercial version of its Cas9 vacuum cleaner. Since Dyson released its Cas9 machine in 2000, two more American-made robotic vacuum cleaners have gone to commercial market: Thermo-Clean and Scale.\n\nOthers in the field of robotics have made small, creative contributions to commercial space development, too. In 2010, Mark Geyer and Olivier Bossaud of Canada's Neuralink Research Center created a computer chip to work together with vacuum cleaners on Earth. Several years before that, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh worked on developing a laboratory-scale robotic vacuum cleaner, the LevelOn, which cranked out 1.5 tons per hour. But commercially available robotic vacuum cleaners seem years away.\n\n2) A Eureka moment?\n\nWhy hasn't Dyson made a commercial vacuum cleaner? Initially, many industrial companies, moving in a ham-fisted way toward manufacturing, stopped funding Dyson. Eventually, former Dyson engineers formed the startup Coalition Robotics, which received an $11.6 million line of credit from J&J, the pharmaceutical company, to fund its modern-day invention.\n\nInitially, Coalition Robotics was focused on turning its newly equipped robotic vacuum cleaners into digital video cameras, which could be mounted on planes. That approach didn't play well with many in Silicon Valley who viewed the device as decidedly not a commercial creation. Eventually, Coalition Robotics switched to a mostly vocational approach, developing robots designed to clean in homes, hospitals and offices, and to transport the cleaning services to consumers in an interactive way.\n\n3) Dyson's rival U.S. startups\n\nDyson, though, has many retail rivals, and two of its biggest major challengers -- Elon Musk's Solar Impulse and Home Depot's SHOP -- are all moving toward producing their own robotic vacuum cleaners.\n\nThere are others on the horizon, too. That's where Dyson comes in. An appointed advisory committee to Dyson and to the Coalition Robotics includes an American-born gynecologist. Brooks Courtwright, director of pediatric gastroenterology at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, is a former spokesperson for Dyson's Velcro brand of dry cleaning. Courtwright explains that he made a personal decision to invest in the company because of its vision. \"Dyson was trying to position itself at a different level from the conventional sterile cleaning companies,\" he told me over Skype. \"So there are still some incumbent companies, but they're not going to replace it with something we haven't thought of yet.\"\n\nIn 1816, Henry Ford self-employed and became the world's first industrialist. (Thomas C. Mann / The New York Times)\n\n4) For what?\n\nDepending on what Dyson does after 2020, we could all be retired cleaning duty and cleaning their grandchildren when they're far too young for most of the best tasks today.\n\nFrom its sleek signature solid carbon-fiber chassis, the futuristic Robomaster's eight legs act as lift pedals and pop axles that lift the robot towards the ground. Turn on a serious cleaner and its arm movements spontaneously smooth over blotchy spots and protect skin from carbon dust, water seepage and hands from vibration. Six fans feed air to the room's furnaces, stirring away methane and other gases that can lead to inhalation allergies and other respiratory issues. The Robomaster won't carry its own rechargeable batteries, so it runs on electricity only from a solar panel on its roof. That power comes via a superconducting charging panel. Even hundreds of years from now, the Robomaster will still run on this long-term battery infrastructure.\n\nNever", "human": "Has Dyson's robotic dream become a reality?\n\nHas Dyson finally cracked its 16-year mission to create a robot vacuum cleaner? The company's teaser video hints at a new release which looks a lot like a rival for the best-selling Roomba, and perfectly illustrates how fast the conditions necessary to create viable robotic products are evolving.\n\nDyson's mysterious video, posted on YouTube (below), heralds a 4 September release. The only piece of information to accompany it reads: '16 years. 200 engineers. \u00a328 million investment. The result? Tell us what you think it is.'\n\nThe device moves around a bit and zooms in and out\u2014interesting, but not as interesting as the glimpse of what looks like its location-analysis technology. It hints at a number of other interesting features too.\n\nWhat's certain is that, with one of the best-known brand names around, Dyson has done its research before going public in a market as hot as robotics is right now.\n\nEarlier this year, the company invested \u00a35m in a lab at Imperial College London designed to help robots 'understand and adapt to the world around them,' Then, in an interview in February, company founder Sir James Dyson (pictured) suggested a robotic cleaner might be in the pipeline and would use computer vision to navigate a room.\n\nImperial's Professor Davison has also spoken about the importance of location tracking: \"We will research and develop systems that allow machines to both understand and perceive their surroundings \u2013 using vision to achieve it,\" he said. \"A truly intelligent domestic robot needs to complete complex everyday tasks while adapting to a constantly changing environment.\"\n\nDyson is also planning a \u00a3250m expansion of one of its UK sites, at Malmesbury, which could provide up to 3,000 new jobs.\n\nPrime time for consumer robotics\n\nMore than anything, Dyson's upcoming launch proves that consumer robotics is finally ready for prime time. In a great up-sum of why, published on TechCrunch, computer scientists Rudina Seseri and Wan Li Zhu, who both work for VC 's Fairhaven Capital, explain why the conditions now are perfect.\n\n\"In recent years,\" they say, \"we have seen accelerated levels of innovation in both software and hardware that are now driving new possibilities for consumer readiness and adoption of personal robotics.\"\n\nThis as happened on a number of levels:\n\nProliferation of devices, compute, and bandwidth. Instead of requiring expensive custom onboard computing, robots are now able to leverage hardware, smartphones and cloud computing for processing and storage. This has implications on both cost and availability of data for machine perception and learning.\n\nProgress in natural language processing, speech, vision and machine learning \u2013 a self-reinforcing loop: As machines can better understand the real world, they learn at a faster rate.\n\nAPI-fication of online services. The ability for machines to tap into multiple online data sources and services allows them to quickly stitch together value, reducing time and cost to go to market. Location-based data, financial and weather, and increasingly healthcare data are all examples.\n\nThey and many others active in the field, also believe that the robotics future won't look much like the current mass-visage of the technology and that, instead, \"artificially intelligent devices will take on a multitude of forms where the form factor will more closely match its functions and use case.\"\n\nMany more will be in the form of embedded intelligence within everyday systems we are already familiar with. And soft robotics further promises to open up the number of applications the technology will have.\n\nThe key, according to Suseri and Zhu, is market acceptance, which will be driven by reliability and safety. In lieu of this, the technology's advance will progress slowly, with interim solutions to pave the way. Cars are in the front line, with incremental modifications such as the sensory-enabled brakes already in the market.\n\nWith a product launch that has many in the industry on the edge of their seats, Dyson is positioning for a leading part in the coming automation of the home and a major slice of the ripening consumer robotics market. It's also an opportunity for a major UK-based company to show some robot muscle.\n\nThis article was originally published on RAS SIG \u2013 the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Special Interest Group \u2013 part of Innovate UK's Knowledge Transfer Network.\n\nIf you liked this article, you may also be interested in:\n\nSee all the latest robotics news on Robohub, or sign up for our weekly newsletter.", "eta_suffix": " couple of delays, is still \"fucking doing it.\" It doesn't have as much (or any) data crunching capabilities, it's limited to motors and a few drive units, and still doesn't even have a cellular network.

{"eta": "This article is going viral, having been shared on Xenosystems, Slate Star Codex, and elsewhere: Has Western-style democracy become too expensive for capitalism?\n\n\"Has Western-style democracy become too expensive for capitalism?\" seems to have been a common complaint among Americans during the 2016 presidential campaign, a sentiment which again and again was raised during the 2016 presidential campaign when Bernie Sanders would remark that \"America is falling behind in so many ways when I talk about income and wealth inequality, when I talk about health care, when I talk about education, when I talk about environmental issues.\" \"In many ways\" is the problem, even if most Americans have never quite grasped that its a problem, as the progressive fellow here would discover.\n\nA quick look at some major global news outlets reports the answer:\n\n\"Western governments must break free from the \"divide and conquer\" posture of the past few decades and face up to the realities of the 21st century \u2014 namely, an interconnected global economy in which customers are no longer willing to believe that a society that treats people so badly can lead a modern economy. People are also no longer willing to sacrifice for an idea. They are much more attuned to the possibilities for betterment.\" \"That globalist idea is the source of our economic pain, and so we must demonstrate that we've changed our thinking to include its constituent elements, people, values, and governance style. In other words, we must replace the simplistic focus on'markets' with an honest attempt to comprehend the full digital, socioeconomic, political and environmental dimensions of the economy.\"\n\nThe context of this article comes from, of all places, the Economist:\n\n\"The tenuous relationship between democracy and the free market in many advanced countries shows how fragile democracy is in a world of floating currencies, ever-more complex markets and the ever-more complex ways in which rules come and go.\" \"The power of the free market \u2014 and the unwillingness of democracies to sacrifice for it \u2014 has allowed for the rise of Donald Trump and Brexit. Their victories were the product of the electorally rendered decision to reallocate political power from the old to the new elites: elites whose ideas were now deemed to be 'the wrong ideas.' The result has been to weaken the legitimacy and the legitimacy of democracies, for which people are suffering.\" \"Whether liberal, democratic, or military, the economic elite has always represented the interests of the banks, the rich, the manufacturers, the professionals, the profit-seekers, the multinationals, the war profiteers, and the national industries.\"\n\nIn other words, Western democracy is totally a good thing, although that's not always the way people see it. This is why the Europeans have gotten quite tense over the \"democratic deficit\" since the 2016 election \u2014 as you will see in a future article \u2014 and why that tension only led to increasingly \"unpossible\" versions of Western politics, because people have come up with all sorts of plans for trying to fill in the gaps left by the West. But this article isn't really about that, it's about the virtues of Western democracy:\n\n\"There are some politicians, such as the German Social Democrat [SDP] [Martin Schulz], who are trying to bridge that gap by increasing the proportion of public financial assets held by local governments. People won't do that even if there is another global crisis. Perhaps that is what Western democracies will need \u2014 the chance to do things differently. Nevertheless, if we are not going to show that we can deal with changing circumstances and sometimes having to retreat, that is why it is worth trying.\"\n\nThe problem we face, as the writer says, is that we've allowed ourselves to be identified as \"Western.\" There's such a thing as \"perfectly Western\" living standards compared to other countries, compared to the USA, and we're finding that we don't want to prove those living standards are \"perfect.\" We've just kind of accepted the \"Western\" label for the sake of convenience, with \"the rest of the world\" being \"the rest of the world.\" There is no pride whatsoever in the \"Great\" Western countries when they say they lack confidence, they lack respect, they lack they confidence to pursue a new \"leadership,\" that they lack the desire to continue any of the leadership of the past 30 years, when everyone in the advanced countries were saying \"We've got to 'go further down that road'.\" So, the 'Eurosceptic' label has been used to shut that debate off for good, and not wanting to participate in that discussion, even if it's the wrong discussion.\n\nAs far as the west is from being a \"metropole,\" the writer implies that there are countries in between that aren't fundamentally ready to sell their sovereignty. The same may be said of Latin America, and Africa, and quite a lot of Asia, but they aren't economically mature enough to let that happen. And with the exception of China, those", "topp": "This article is going viral, having been shared on Xenosystems, Slate Star Codex, and elsewhere: Has Western-style democracy become too expensive for capitalism?\n\nTo begin with, these claims are patently false. While the American socialist has been in charge of everything from education to the minimum wage, and to say nothing of welfare programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the world's richest man has enjoyed a monster income from his stock market scams and foreign, quasi-military adventures.\n\nHe has never accomplished anything, at least in terms of social progress, or even the efficacy of his policy vision. He cannot be won over to our political views.\n\nIn short, economic theory requires that exporters should be punished when selling to consumers because the former often suffer first in the aftermath of sustained trade deficits. Furthermore, more imports must result in lower prices for consumers since exporting is tantamount to a loss in net income.\n\nCapitalism, in contrast, both provides and supports progressive economic policies. A meritocratic society is a model that assists all citizens in achieving their careers and aspirations by purchasing the goods and services their hard work has produced.\n\nFutures Markets\n\nSo should all progressive economists scream bloody murder when the basic rule of markets, who requires importers to subsidize producers, is ignored and ignored when it benefits producers while hurting consumers?\n\nThis point is so obvious that even progressive economists have failed to catch it and must often commit involuntary manslaughter (and yet realize they should watch their Twitter mentions).\n\nBut while the Democrats'\u2014and Republicans'\u2014control of Congress has, for over a century, allowed the corporate-dominated Fed to make even more disruptive and unproductive monetary policy decisions, it has not hindered or otherwise thwarted trade-rules or financial regulations.\n\nRepublicans, of course, have maintained rule by the economic interests of big Wall Street and shielded them from any market logic including import and export issues. One ex-Boehner adviser now says Republicans must \"affirm our world view of capitalism\" if they want to defeat Trump.\n\nBut this obvious truth has not, on the whole, gone unchallenged. Even neocons have begun to recognize that, despite war-mongering, the economic Gospel of prosperity is not a \"death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThus, much of the factual core of the left's anti-Trump movement occurs in the form of terms that all agree are both eerily similar to Trump's and increasingly have come to be seen as self-evident.\n\nThose opposed to progressive policies claim these are not \"unfair\" arrangements (and are presented in an identical tone) and there is nothing unfair about free trade.\n\nMaking Good Money?\n\nIn economic theory, when we begin to explicitly compare the options available to consumers and producers it becomes important to recognize that only the property costs of production can be precisely measured. Any variables such as outlay of capital, labor, marketing costs or pollution costs are not analyzed. Consequently, any risks of capital surpluses accumulated during these years are avoided. Equitable exchanges are possible.\n\nThus, even trade policies that and their advocates fail to define even assume the possibility of equitable trade are both a matter of math.\n\nIn contrast, forces opposed to U.S. action from the left\u2014upending the Bretton Woods era to the late 1990s\u2014fail to account for the presumed costs of exports, hisprinciples, taxes and regulatory regimes imposed on production, and the burden of trade regulations (unfair; also not covered) suffered by them.\n\nSuch analysts claim that no such costs exist. Negotiated trade deals contain such terms and provisions. The \"trans-Pacific Partnership\" (TPP) with Pacific Rim nations and the Single European Act (or Section 2 of the North American Free Trade Agreement) with other nations does not contain these inclusionary language or \"leaves their own agreements in effect and gives them the effective force of U.S. law.\"\n\nInstead, this left-anemic criticism falls back on one fact that we have studied over and over and whose conclusion is clear: trade is fair or otherwise are engaged, not in spite of but because of the provisions of NAFTA.\n\nImport Restrictions\n\nBut earlier trade laws appeared with the help of expanded, publicly funded export subsidies in place, exported from the United States to British Columbia in 1959 to Saskatchewan in 1995.\n\nA transcript from a talk given at Brown University in 2010 by TPP's foot-soldier Carlos Lozada includes this tentative statement regarding trade tariffs: \"There are lots of proposals out there for tariffs on Canadian goods with no reference to North American, and NAFTA (and to North America in general).\"\n\nLozada then added that protections on international capital travel \u2014 a provision \"symbolized by our NAFTA\" \u2014 must be off-limits for Canada because without this absurd pact \"there would be no Third World debt crisis today.\"\n\nThe original", "human": "This article is going viral, having been shared on Xenosystems, Slate Star Codex, and elsewhere: Has Western-style democracy become too expensive for capitalism?\n\nThis short article offers a lot to unpack.\n\nThe central reason why Western democracy is in decline is that its capitalist bedfellow can no longer afford the financial demands that full-blown democracy is placing upon it. History has shown that capitalism can adapt, consorting with a variety of political systems in the past 5,000 years. Looking ahead, it will probably find another political host to aid its survival. Democracy \u2014 capitalism's host over the past century \u2014 is far more brittle. \u2026\n\nMuch ink has been spilled on the significance of 2016's one-two populist punches as thrown by Brexit then Trump. What does it mean for the West? Most analysis concludes that parts of the West are having second thoughts about globalisation, and there is undoubted \u2014 if only partial \u2014 merit in this assessment.\n\nDonald Trump won the US presidential election by convincing disgruntled former factory workers in the critical swing Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania that factories translocated from the US to Mexico and China had \"stolen\" middle class jobs from Middle America. A few factories have migrated, though the main effect of Asian and Mexican competition has been to limit wage increases much more than \"steal\" jobs.\n\nThere is a trend these days for authors on supposedly reputable sites (Bloomberg, Financial Times, and The Economist) to make these grand proclamations but with scarcely any proof to support them. Technically, all you need are two data points to call something a trend, which in this case is Brexit and Trump. The Financial Times, purportedly reputable newspaper, is going down the same path as Zero Hedge and Rolling Stone by using sensationalism and over-generalizations for cheap ad clicks at the cost of accuracy and journalistic integrity.\n\nAnther possibly, as I discuss here, is that these results don't signify anything significant, due to the high degree of randomness. Half the county is going to vote 'left', the other 'right', so it comes down to a small number of undecided voters. The author ignores the French and Dutch elections and how Theresa May lost seats, all of which puts a dent in the thesis.\n\nThere is growing anti-democratic sentiment online, but it will take longer for this to manifest in real life.\n\nThe second is that the centre of economic gravity is shifting back from West to East. The connection between these two mega trends is that, although the East has flirted with democracy, its new champions are not democratic nor are there indications that they are likely to be, at least in the sense that the West regards the concept. Only India's ascendancy might yet give Western-style democracy a second chance and a new lease on life.\n\nAgain with the overgeneralizing and baseless suppositions. According to what evidence? There is scant evidence of such a shift. Of the 2000 largest companies, 540 of them are based in the US, whereas only 200 are in China. The biggest and most influential companies in the world\u2013Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Exxon, Tesla, and Walmart\u2013were all founded in America. Maybe the author is referring to China's manufacturing, which has long since eclipsed that of the United States.\n\nWhat does the author mean by 'too expensive'? This can mean two things: costs of living being to expensive for Americans, which for things such as rent, healthcare, and tuition, costs have exceeded inflation, and or, it can mean 'expensive' in terms of excessive entitlement spending due to ill-conceived social and immigration policies.\n\nAs McKinsey has noted, almost 70 per cent of households in the 25 most advanced economies \u2014 some 560m people \u2014 have seen their real incomes stay flat or fall since 2005.\n\nYet despite stagnant real wages for most workers, Americans have a lot of purchasing power, especially compared to the United Kingdom. (Related: Stagnant Inflation-Adjusted US Wages: Putting Things in Perspective) Americans, even the poorest, have a lot of purchasing power. In most counties, standards of living for the poor and middle class are much worse. Look at Walmart and how much cheap stuff there is there\u2013a week's worth of an American's paycheck buys more economic utility than for someone living in Britain.

{"eta": "In the fall of 1962, whilst The Birds was in post-production, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut carried out extensive interviews with Alfred Hitchcock at his offices at Universal Studios. The interviews were based on a stage play entitled Time and Traveling (later for film as Airplane and Casablanca). The full text of Truffaut's film profile can be seen here.\n\nMr. Hitchcock's feel for the film's final scenes had been greatly enhanced by the fact that it was set \"three, four, five or six years before.\" Further information on this subject comes from the Spring 1987 issue of Vintage Cinema magazine (Volume 40).\n\nHitchcock said he made very few revisions to the film. \"Not much. I think it was just a kind of slapback to those days when I did the three monochrome movies. Even though I just went into movie making because of the holidays, I thought that if possible I should improve the picture.\"\n\nCinema critics would have to disagree with Hitchcock in one aspect: Time and Traveling was the last production where he was involved with the main screenplay team. But it is a curious comment to make: three years earlier he had penned his version of Henry V for Simon, against the wishes of his employer, producer Joel Silver (under contract to Silver's studio), who believed that it should have an original title of The Two Gentlemen of Verona.\n\nHow Hitchcock found \"the other brother\"\n\nHitchcock's selection of Miles Warren to direct The Birds was a relatively recent choice. Warren had never worked in television, even though he appeared occasionally on film and had written a few scripts. His first movie, On the Waterfront with Sherwood Schwartz, had been a success. He had worked as a stuntman in a number of classic movies, like Top Gun (1986) and Here's Johnny (1987). (He also wrote On the Waterfront with Sherwood Schwartz. It was submitted to the Cannes Film Festival, and the jury awarded it ten prizes out of seventy.) Warren also directed The Town (1985) and Semi-Pro (1987).\n\nWarren was not the man to get Hitchcock to line up a role for the composer. His work on On the Waterfront was all but forgotten by the time the movie was completed. It had been originally offered to James Newton Howard (co-author of Hitchcock's 1947 screenplay), who had turned it down. The director was bitterly disappointed, and suggested to him one day that there should be a tete-a-tete with Miles Warren.\n\nHitchcock phoned his friend and assistant David Sullivan. He had apparently learned of the promising opportunity when he got back into business in 1959. He ordered Sullivan to ask Warren for a meeting immediately. Sullivan asked Warren whether he would like to see his new directorial debut. Warren said he agreed.\n\nThat afternoon Sullivan phoned Hitchcock, and asked if he could accompany him to the studio lot. Warren agreed and hurriedly phoned himself to know the exact time when he would be back. There was something odd about this meeting. On the appointed day, Warren arrived at the studio lot not carrying anything in his hand. Instead he went out of the limo, walked a few paces, and then said to a journalist, \"I don't know what happened.\"\n\nAnother journalist asked, \"Why did you leave your coat?\" Another asked, \"Why did you go away?\" Finally, the third said, \"Why did you leave the car?\"\n\nWhat was it about this day that got him from the car? It was the day in question when the film was actually being made.\n\nWarren's scene in the film (visited on Kubrick's site) and more images of Warren\n\nWarren did one final casting for The Birds. A woman in the audience asked to be brought down to have a look at the set. She gave Warren the very funny name Rachelle. She walked back and forth watching the birds and flowers as the director recorded her scenes. Warren grabbed some teakwood and arranged parts of the wood that she had only seen in the films (screens) to help the real wood look as real. When Rachelle was done, she returned to her seat and announced, \"Hitchcock has seen me!\" When she came back, she thanked him with that sad face.\n\nThis last casting session had an effect on the original script and the final sequence. It had been scheduled to shoot that day, but on Hitchcock's request, the script was changed to December 12, rather than January 14. On this day, she would be replaced by another actress, whose casting was connected with the fact that Audrey Hepburn was taking her grand pianoforte there as part of her Paris trip. (It did not help much, but it made a little world of difference to the ending.)\n\nTime\n\nFor years, the prospect of the director commenting on his own completed film for publication has been frowned upon. The curiosity peaked", "topp": "In the fall of 1962, whilst The Birds was in post-production, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut carried out extensive interviews with Alfred Hitchcock at his offices at Universal Studios. The interviews did not provide conclusive proof that Truffaut was the'real' Hitchcock, and were instead intended to prove that Truffaut was 'in denial'. On subsequent occasions, I (and Mr Fogarty) were unaware that in fact Truffaut was the'real' Hitch. In September 1972, two weeks after La Femme Nikita had been released in the UK and cinema in general, Alfred Hitchcock's film-maker friend Dick Rawlings sent 'his two prized couriers' to New York to hand over two Pro-X Pro 45 cameras, assorted chemicals and a short story book, to a man who was called 'Red Earl'. Later a man identified as Richard Bower, had sent the cameras back to the UK and the story book to the Netherlands. Following this and a number of other events, it is clear that John Gray (never known to be Truffaut's real name) and Richard Bower were the two couriers. In fact it is very probable that the Pro-X Pro 45 cameras, chemicals and short story book were in 'adlib' form - possibly for the American release of Red Earl in the fall of 1966. This is important, because John Gray believed that if the Pro-X cameras and chemicals were very similar to those used at the studio for The Birds, they would have been introduced into the American market long before then. John Gray's other source was an ex-Mrnuner manager, who claimed to be a collector of The Birds' production and who, as a child, had seen a complete reel of The Birds, handed down from a Mr. Lockwood to him by Alfred Hitchcock. The second source, however, was probably not a collector, but some sort of professional film-maker. His identity is not known. The third is another of former Mrnuners to 'Sherlock Holmes', Tom Heywood, who purchased the entire film through a series of anonymous auditions. Thanks to this source, I can exclude as being no real person and presumably not the 'Red Earl' assumed by many. On 29 June 1977, the film was re-released in the UK and American markets in a colour print; it was renamed A Wind in the Willows, The Birds was remade in New York (later The Birds II), Tully Babble Barnum appeared in The Phantom of the Opera, Tricky Dick, The Face of Evil and Verne, The Dream Catcher, Master of the Rolls-Royce, Tootsie, Professor Trencher. The film's tracks were covered by Harold Arlen's group The Beavers (somehow even clearer in the water this time), T. Rex, King Diamond, Sesame Street, The Beatles, Roberta Flack, Alan Sparhawk and Miley Cyrus. At this writing, the picture has never been released in the UK. It is understood that, in 1973, a re-release began taking place in the States and proved wildly successful. In April 1975, the dailies were re-issued in real-life colour; before my watch was started, its signal bays and all other exit ports had been cut - thus preserving the original blue on black picture. It is reasonable to assume that, from the time before I was born, too, Tully Babble Barnum (who seemed to spring from a Jell-O cupboard somewhere) appears on the surface of their home-made household utensils, taking special pleasure in the squirming and popping-out of toys like a fanatical true fan of the artist. The Rolling Stones' album Pigs On The Wing was produced in 1975 on this picture and in 1979, Around The World In A Day at the Philadelphia airport was made on a colour picture back. It was released in many formats, including an extreme digi-disc version on a portable mini-disc of the early New Order album Unplugged. In a more general sense, it was said that it was the first picture ever filmed with 14 film shots at once and that, taken side-by-side, it was the greatest-ever presentation of film in any dimension to this day. Unsurprisingly, The Birds was one of the most successful films of all time - at the very least, it accounted for the highest grossing theatrical gross of the decade in America: $32,221,122,903, in 1987. On its release in the US, The Birds was shot using three different Exacts; its transfer was picked by The Film Guild and its first print given an 'A'. In July 1986, Michel Gondry, Peter Gunn and Richard McCready were filmed for the shoot (a total of 31 scenes including Hitchcock) and, after the film had been shot for a few months, over the course of December 1986 (and end of January 1987), included in a VHS package.

The interviews were recorded to audio tape and the content eventually edited down into Truffaut's Hitchcock book.\n\nAlthough Truffaut could speak a little English, he hired Helen Scott (of the French Film Office in New York) to act as the translator for the interviews.\n\nTruffaut had intended to quickly publish the book of the interviews, but the first edition wasn't published until several years later (1966 in France and 1967 in America). To bring the book up-to-date, Truffaut conducted further interviews to discuss Marnie and Torn Curtain.\n\nIn 1984, Patricia Hitchcock donated a set of the interview tapes to the Margaret Herrick Library, where they are now part of the Hitchcock Collection. Although Truffaut claimed that the recordings lasted 50 hours, the surviving tapes \u2014 which cover the 1962 interviews \u2014 last for less than 26 hours.\n\nResearch by Janet Bergstrom[1] has made clear the fact that the book often does not contain a verbatim transcript of Hitchcock's responses to Truffaut's questions...\n\nCertain categories of information seem to have been omitted from the published interview for reasons over and above the need to keep the page count down or omit Hitchcock's slightly off\u2013color jokes and descriptions of individuals that might offend them or even prove libelous. Information was dropped that would be considered precious today, particularly by film historians: explanations of technique were greatly limited compared to the original, references to television and the film industry as such, including observations about people who were not necessarily well\u2013known and what they did, as Hitchcock remembered this or that film or phase of his career.\n\nThe interviews were used as the basis of Alain Riou and St\u00e9phane Boulan's French stage play Hitch: When Truffaut Confronted Hitchcock.\n\nAudio\n\nThe audio tapes of the interviews have not been released commercially.

{"eta": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN's Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns and other financial disclosures. Tapper questioned Sanders' view of whether tax law enforcement has enough investigative authority to pursue financial crimes. Tapper brought up the recent decision to release Bernie Sanders' 2016 tax returns, which shows that the senator has received in 2013 income of $1.45 million. Clinton Clinton released her 2008 tax returns last February. Her running mate, Tim Kaine, released his own returns in March and made four other statements in support of transparency from May 2015 to June 6. Jeff Flake Asked Trump if he was going the route of his rivals, Trump said, \"Well, I like transparency. I think I have more transparency than I've had \u2026 and I think I'm probably much more transparent than she is, frankly, if I want to put it lightly.\" Flake also said, \"I'm not going to lie to you; I don't really care if it leaks or not.\" Here's the full exchange: Sen.

That includes 10 percent of Trump voters who consider a \"forfeit\" forfeiture to be morally acceptable even when the wrongdoer has broken the law.

A paper published in The Wall Street Journal noted that people didn't want Donald Trump to be president instead of writing that \"people didn't want Donald Trump in charge of the country,\" which is incredibly useful because it helps explain why his message has not resonated with the American people. This also is not the America we want to remember:\n\nThe key to why Donald Trump is unlikely to win the Electoral College is that he does not have a remarkable chance of winning the Electoral College. He will have to rely on states that have already voted for the candidate who has won the most votes, which means it is highly unlikely that he will have the sort of landslide electoral victory that Romney enjoyed. If he makes it to 270 electoral votes without Ohio, Florida or Virginia by taking states Trump won, he would need to win just five of the remaining nine remaining states; that is significantly less than the required 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. It's not unlikely that Donald Trump and Ben Carson beat Hillary Clinton in all three \"battleground\" states but there would be few historical precedents. [The Wall Street Journal, 1/17/16]\n\nMegyn Kelly: Trump Is In \"a Complicated Relationship With The American People.\" MSNBC host Megyn Kelly said she was \"astonished\" to see that Trump and his supporters continue to believe he would be able to win the election even though many polls have shown that he will lose, without a full understanding of his position. Kelly said:\n\nMEIYN KELLY (HOST): I had a great conversation with Donald Trump. He is in a complicated relationship with the American people.

What have you talked to him about this? You said that you didn't want any sort of pressure to take off on him. Is that still", "topp": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN's Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns.\n\nTapper said that Sanders has not released his tax returns and should release them.\n\nSanders' campaign has responded by sending out press releases criticizing Tapper's question, arguing that the Vermont senator is being dishonest. \"Like a good politician, Sen. Sanders will do what is right, with no illusions, but in the interest of time and then explain why he believes the answer to your question is no,\" said Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver in a press release.\n\nThe argument that Sanders is too transparent isn't new \u2014 most Hillary Clinton supporters would likely say that's where their preference lies.\n\nFor example, in 2013, NBC's Andrea Mitchell said that \"anyone who believes Sen. Sanders should make some public tax returns is not kidding themselves\" if they think he is untrustworthy.\n\nClinton's team, however, argues that Sanders' refusal to fully release his returns is an issue of his transparency. \"What we are seeing here is, one, Sanders is intentionally being dishonest, and, two, is then trying to hide it, which is one of the reasons that he is playing this right now.\"\n\nThe fact that Hillary Clinton is being played as dishonest doesn't mean that Sanders won't release his tax returns even though the U.S. Constitution only allows presidents to be public speakers for 10 years.\n\nFirst Amendment Rights\n\nAnother line of attack Sanders and his supporters get from Clinton supporters is that the Constitution places the right to comment on candidates' tax returns under the First Amendment.\n\nUltimately, the simple argument doesn't stand up to the fact that independent politicians have always been more open to questions about their finances than national politicians.\n\nThat's especially true since the GOP and Democrats have been frequently accused of equivocating between making candidates (like Barack Obama) more transparent and making candidates (like John McCain) more acceptable to special interests.\n\nRich Taxes, Little Accountability\n\nWith the creation of the Edmunds-Tucker amendments (the last significant tax reform legislation) in 1913, the United States completely changed its constitution to require presidential candidates to release their personal tax returns.\n\nThis amendment, however, did not even require candidates to pay taxes before they ran for office. In his book \"It Takes A Village,\" Joseph Kishore, a tax law professor at the University of Massachusetts, argues that because candidates can use a \"primary strategy\" of \"complementing endorsements,\" a candidate could indeed run as a tax slacker while a primary strategy, while not taxing, also performed a similar function.\n\nHaving high taxes force candidates to position themselves as out of touch with the average American while keeping them outside of corruption looks good on paper, but is by far the greatest challenge for presidential candidates now that both major parties have copied the laws in their possession to the letter.\n\nAt least five of the 15 primary candidates \"must pay more in taxes than average Americans,\" The Washington Post wrote. The truth is that low income earners pay the highest taxes of any group and have faced numerous financial constraints to avoid violating the tax code.\n\nWe call the end of McCain's tax blackout the biggest reenactment of slavery ever created in the United States since the 18th century.\n\nStructure of Presidential Compensation\n\nThe Paris Conference on Corporate Tax Rates, known as the World Bank's ultimatum to the US, demanded in 1916 that the U.S. federal government provide a deduction of 3.5% for each dollar of compensation earned by a new company \u2014 except for companies with businesses with employees, corporations that grant direct stock ownership to stockholders, social welfare organizations, scientific research, public education and research, social assistance, military research and development, sales of goods or services, access to \"lost wealth\" or treasure during war or in business failures, emergency assistance to the poor and emergency repayments of loans.\n\nTaxes on compensation would have been given by the Internal Revenue Service based upon the value of the services the former employees provided. Over 100 companies could have qualified for tax deductions under this condition, but none did.\n\nThere is no such incentive today with respect to presidential candidates because they all have contracts that basically require presidential candidates to become money self-made multimillionaires.\n\nBut that's not the only incentive that currently exists. Presidential candidates also often get priority treatment during roundtable meetings where powerful and influence-hungry CEOs can air any grievance that they have.\n\nAn important factor in obtaining the payments is that each monthly salary is $450,000, which according to Forbes, may be taxed at a rate of up to 24.8%.\n\nWhile this may be several times the minimum wage, it's still $450,000. Of course, this is not the minimum wage but average wage since a couple with two kids making the minimum wage", "human": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN's Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns.\n\nTapper brought up the topic: \"I'm kind of surprised that you haven't gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her website the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years?\"\n\nSanders responded, \"You know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We've been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain't going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there's not going to be anything new in it that people haven't seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can.\"\n\nTapper wasn't satisfied. \"But nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point, and whether or not there's anything exciting in them....\"\n\nAt this point, Sanders interjected, \"No, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can.\"\n\nHow transparent has Sanders been with his tax past returns? Not very, compared with others in the 2016 presidential field. Here's a closer look.\n\nAs our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nHere's a look at what their current archive of the 2016 candidates looks like:\n\nIn other words, among the candidates still in the race, Sanders' releases are less extensive than anybody's but Donald Trump. (Trump, too, has faced criticism for refusing to share his returns.)\n\nAnd Sanders' shortcomings are actually bigger than the screenshot above would suggest. The 2014 filings Sanders released consist of just the first two summary pages of his Form 1040 and the equivalent summary pages from his home-state Vermont tax form.\n\nWhy does this matter? Unlike most of the other candidates, Sanders has not released the succeeding pages -- the nitty gritty detail of things like charitable donations and other types of itemized deductions. For instance, Clinton's release for tax year 2014 is 44 pages long, or more than 10 times the length of Sanders' for the same year.\n\nIt's worth noting that Sanders, as a member of Congress, files annual financial disclosures, which are accessible online back to 2012. And as a presidential candidate, he also files financial disclosure documents to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBut tax returns are much more detailed. And despite what Sanders said in the exchange with Tapper, his campaign did not provide PolitiFact with any earlier, publicly available tax forms. The campaign told the Post that it has not released any other tax returns prior to 2014. (The campaign did tell PolitiFact that they would release his 2015 returns once they are filed.)\n\nTax and disclosure experts we contacted agreed that Sanders' current disclosures are weak by historical standards.\n\n\"If I filed the first two pages of my return with the IRS, it would not take long for them to ding me,\" said Kenneth A. Gross of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a specialist in political disclosure and ethics. \"There is a lot of information on the pages following the cover pages.\"\n\nJoseph J. Thorndike, the Tax Analysts official who heads the Tax History Project, agreed.\n\nSanders \"has not, in fact, released his most recent tax return,\" Thorndike said. \"He has released a portion of that return. The IRS would not accept a Form 1040 as a complete return and neither should voters. Also, it's worth noting that Sanders has not released any portion of his older returns. \u2026 If Mitt Romney had tried to release an incomplete return in 2012, the media would never have accepted it.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSanders told Tapper that his campaign has released his past tax returns.\n\nSanders said his 2015 return is forthcoming, and he has made other types of disclosures in the past, including congressional and presidential-candidate filings.

In a video posted on social media, Gavin Long, the man identified by a U.S. government official as the Baton Rouge police shooting suspect, urges fighting back against oppressors.\n\nThroughout his postings, Long described violence as the solution to what he saw as oppression of black Americans.

{"eta": "The nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the right to self-defense.\n\nProponents of gun control legislation are often quick to argue that such regulations could prevent the \"lone nut\" of gun violence, while their detractors are quick to point out that strict gun control laws have gone unnoticed for decades.\n\nThere has been only one state Supreme Court in America ruled by a three-four vote to overturn an unconstitutional gun control law and, almost 50 years later, the issue hasn't been settled.\n\nIt's time for the Texas Legislature to reform itself and pass bills (either enacting them or on their own), which promote the gun rights of law-abiding citizens while advocating gun control legislation.\n\nOur favorite recent pro-gun legislation that has passed either through the legislature or governor's mansion in Texas, is the Woman's Right-to-Carry Act. This law grants women the right to carry their concealed weapons anywhere there is no person \u2014 not even their spouse \u2014 that has a concealed carry permit.\n\nThese women will be responsible for learning the capabilities of their weapon, bringing it to a safe distance when it's being carried, and knowing exactly what type of ammunition and how to safely handle it. By amending the Texas Constitution, the Woman's Right to Carry, is a wonderfully made law that promotes personal responsibility and reinforces self-defense. It does have flaws however, as the current Texas constitution only protects public areas while both the federal and Texas constitutions apply in private places.\n\nOn top of the Woman's Right to Carry, Texas lawmakers recently passed a bill to allow gun owners to possess weapons after several years. While that may prevent an offender from having access to firearms, it would also likely leave domestic violence batterers alone. This bill is hardly the first time lawmakers have attempted to enact the kind of legislation most other states have. Most states, however, have provisions that protect a person with a restraining order or the person's spouse from being denied the right to possess firearms. As gun control advocates repeatedly state, their attempt to remedy the issue of domestic violence must be true domestic violence prevention. It's one way you can truly \"save lives.\"\n\n1 Corinthians 15:59-60 ESV | Chapter 57 \"When you are conquered, make no provision for the weak.\" We all can keep our heads while some people refuse to let go, and lack the strength to accept the Lord Jesus into their lives. And even as they say in the Bible, \"Those who possess, give to them; those that are content, give to them; those who beg, give to them; and those who seek, lend to them; and those who delight, do good to them; and those that seem destitute, lend to them.\" 2 Corinthians 6:9 ESV | Chapter 32 Is someone missing? Is someone sick? Are there people that are facing a financial crisis? Are there children needing a parent? Are there elderly people needing counseling? Are there people in need of clothing, help with a broken home, and healing? To those who do not receive, there is no reward\n\nAs the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we understand that civil institutions\u2014including our state and local governments and justice systems\u2014will only limit people's ability to do good.\n\nPolice, prisons, child protective services, and child protective agencies are the institutions that will often restrain a person's ability to be a loving and productive member of our community. These institutions are filled with people who are often emotionally chaotic, undisciplined, and are drawn to illicit drugs and alcohol, among other things. In addition to being ill-equipped for the challenges such a scenario presents, they also tend to lack the resources to fully engage. Instead of trying to provide these agencies with the resources they need to function well, it should be the responsibility of the legislature to provide them with a sufficient funding stream to ensure they can properly identify individuals suffering from psychiatric and personal issues, assess whether it is in the best interest of the community, and provide the necessary training.\n\nA great example of this can be seen in the Charleston Massacre, which occurred on the 12th, when nine African-American churchgoers sat in prayer and were gunned down. In the weeks following, there were numerous claims of racial discrimination and racist hate crimes throughout the country. These were blamed, in part, on the lack of opportunity for people of African heritage.\n\nBut while many African-Americans were taken advantage of by unscrupulous individuals, there were many positive steps taken to protect young African-American and white children from the dangers associated with these violent groups. Furthermore, the reaction from the city and nation was overwhelming positive. In fact, it is the growth of the Black community in this country, together with its support of police and vigilantes, that has allowed the church to be \"in the black community.\"\n\n2 Peter 1:8 ESV | Chapter 36 And if they confess their sins, he is faithful and just to", "topp": "The nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the right to self-defense.\n\nProponents of gun control legislation are often openly opposed to the right of gun ownership by restricting the pre-existing right of gun ownership. They claim to have evidence that restricting the firearm is directly linked to acts of violent crime.\n\nClaims for Restricting Gun Ownership\n\n(Source: The Lueken Institute Collection)\n\nMyth: Firearms used in self-defense are more likely to have detachable magazines\n\nPeople have a natural inclination to keep firearms with them when they are away from home and perhaps when not at work, but there are better ways to protect yourself. Therefore, laws to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and those who do not need or want them could lead to fewer accidents, less mass shootings and hopefully less crime.\n\nFact: There is no direct correlation between a firearms owner keeping a firearm and a violent crime incident. Studies found no correlation between self-reported gun ownership and the rate of homicide. The rate of homicides in the U.S. is an average of 12.8 per 100,000 people compared with an annual average of 12.9 per 100,000 in Europe. The rate of homicides associated with private guns includes homicides committed by criminals with guns.\n\nMedia or Internet rumours about gun owner toting make up a small proportion of the attempted murders attributed to rifles, handguns and shotguns that are reported to police or reported to the media. These false rumours could lead someone to intentionally or unintentionally fire a gun to escape from a home or hotel room without a firearm.\n\nClaims for Restricting Firearms\n\n(Source: The Lueken Institute Collection)\n\nMyth: A lot of federal gun control laws are unnecessary and have only marginal effects on crime\n\nThe drive to enact more legislation to control guns is one that opponents of gun ownership claim are misguided. At first glance, many supporters of these gun controls may say that the actions involved in carrying a firearm could have significant and important consequences in preventing gun violence.\n\nHowever, most violent crimes happen when the guns used are legally possessed and stored, as opposed to when the illegal use of the firearms is being completed. These actions, however, are not directly related to gun control measures.\n\nThe pursuit of gun control usually appears to be driven by lowballing and behind-the-back politics. Rather than data that are useful, the allegations against gun control operations are put forward to throw doubt on the consequences of gun controls.\n\nThe opponents of such laws claim that they are unnecessary and that the enforcement of current gun control laws will lead to a loss of control. As a result, these laws risk giving people the right to carry guns in dangerous places to the point where it may impede law enforcement, endanger people and put them at risk of domestic violence, burglary or robbery.\n\nMaking many of these claims, however, appear to be purely politically motivated. Moreover, sometimes these allegations actually weaken the reasons for gun ownership or at least help to divide opponents of gun ownership.\n\nMyth: Little or no research has been done on the role that regulating guns can have on firearm use\n\nSupporters of gun control often invoke the argument that having a gun will make the streets safer, but I believe the contrary.\n\nThere are many good reasons to have a gun in your home. For one, it is arguably the most commonly used form of personal self-defense. Unless one is targeted in some undefined epidemic of violence, one has the right to bear arms for self-protection that shouldn't be misunderstood as a proliferation of guns.\n\nResearch indicates that the presence of guns in a home increases the likelihood of an injury associated with knife use, increases the likelihood of domestic violence, increases the number of men who are victims of sexual assault and decreases the chances of not being hurt in an accident at work.\n\n(Source: Gun Legalization: Your Right to Bear Arms in a Responsible Manner)(Newsmax.com)\n\nDozens of studies found a very real association between guns in the home and violent behaviour. Increasing the number of guns in a home may not actually reduce the numbers of serious gun crimes, but those who own large number of guns are a good predictors of other types of criminal activity.\n\nSome advocates and lawmakers have even gone so far as to say that there is a link between having guns in the home and the risk of being killed in a domestic violence incident.\n\nFact: There is no association between having guns in a home and suicide. The number of lives saved per firearm owned is also insignificant, as is the amount of money saved per firearm. Of course, that means a gun is more useful in your tool box than it is used in a close personal need.\n\nFact: The cost of banning specific guns is justified. Since violent and criminal offences such as murder will increase, taxes on deadly weapons would be justified on the basis", "human": "The nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the right to self-defense.\n\nProponents of gun control legislation are often staunch supporters of the nebulous \"right to choose\" an abortion. Conversely, those who staunchly defend the right to keep and bear arms also frequently take the pro-life position. But to gun control proponents this is an untenable, even contradictory, position; \"Guns kill people! They're dangerous and deadly! Their only purpose is to kill! Yet you say you're 'pro-life'? You're a hypocrite!\"\n\nSuch sentiments, however, are based on logical fallacies, emotional reactions rather than rational analysis, and a misunderstanding of the role firearms play in a law-abiding society. In fact, the right to keep and bear arms and the pro-life position are entirely consistent with one another. It's the positions of gun control proponents who are also abortion proponents that don't match.\n\nThe nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the sanctity of human life and the right to self-defense. Gun controllers fail to grasp, or to acknowledge, that firearms are means to ends; they are objects that possess no ability to act on their own, and have no inherent moral qualities. They cannot choose. They must be directed by human intention, and serve the ends of that intention.\n\nA Right to Life Includes a Right to Self-Defense\n\nAs objects, they have no choice or say about how they are used. Their \"purpose\" is not to kill, but to shoot bullets efficiently. Given the likely billions of rounds fired each year by all firearms in all hands across the United States and the numbers of deaths due to gunshot wounds, which number in the tens of thousands, one can easily realize people put firearms to a great number of uses other than harming humans. To look at overall use, then, firearms are notoriously inefficient at killing, were that their sole \"purpose.\"\n\nBut human intention is paramount in using any tool or object. There are, broadly speaking, two groups of people: law-abiding and criminal. The intentions they have in employing firearms tend to be perfectly opposite. In fact, criminals intend to deprive someone of life, liberty, or property. This is the motivating force that precipitates the situation to which the law-abiding must react. Law-abiding people who are armed can then bring deadly force to stop the criminal actor.\n\nThe rights to liberty and property are meaningless in the absence of a right to life. Similarly, the right to life doesn't matter when one is deprived of the right and means to self-defense. Firearms, generally, are the most effective means of self-defense. They are not the only ones, nor is their use always the most appropriate in a given situation. But in the hands of the law-abiding, they are importantly employed to defend the right to life.\n\nThe right to life is not, however, contingent upon self-defense; self-defense aids and abets it. One does not forfeit one's right to life just because one lacks the means, ability, will, or awareness to defend oneself. The unborn human has a right to life, as does anyone who has not forfeited that right through criminal action and society's legal judgment. But the unborn do not possess the means, ability, will, and awareness to defend themselves; they must be protected.\n\nAny society that recognizes the right to keep and bear arms as legitimate means to the right of self-defense must then also recognize its obligation to defend the right to life of the helpless among us.\n\nThe right to life is mutual, and not exclusive, so long as someone doesn't forfeit it through voluntary criminal action. You have a right to life, as do I, as do the helpless. One's right to life does not exclude the right to life of another.\n\nYou Can't Control Nature, But You Can Control Yourself\n\nBut what, then, to make of gun controllers, and abortionists? They argue on the one hand that they have a right \"not to be killed\" or to \"be safe\" or to \"have a safe environment.\" On the other hand, they also argue abortion is necessary for the healthy and happy life of the mother of the to-be-aborted child, and that she, and she alone, may choose when and if to end the life within her.\n\nThese are untenable positions. There are no rights to \"safe environments.\" Rights are natural to human life. They flow from nature, but depend on human volition and moral choice. It is because we can choose either evil or good that we can and must have rights. But those rights are vis-a-vis other humans only\u2014you have no right to life from circumstance or natural action.\n\nWill you indict a tiger, or an earthquake?

{"eta": "KIEV/SEVASTOPOL, Crimea (Reuters) - The career of Sergei Yeliseyev helps to explain why Ukraine's armed forces gave up Crimea almost a year ago, before its referendums on joining Russia and reopening the border with Russia were cast off under the pressure of street protests.\n\nA pro-Kremlin rally in Perevalnoye, Crimea's capital, holds a sign declaring Crimea a \"Russian city\". The vote, which saw 62 percent of Crimean residents say they wanted to stay in the Russian federation, was boycotted by Western nations and the United Nations. Russia annexed Crimea in March.\n\nTens of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest against Russia's response to their non-binding referendum with counter-protesters who turned out in droves.\n\nSince then, the peninsula has been a tense political battleground for Russia as the separatist rebels from the Russian-speaking east move in and Russia defends a no-fly zone in the region.\n\nWhat happened to Yeliseyev at the time of the referendum has since became a cautionary tale for Yanukovych, the former president.\n\nIn May, Yeliseyev, president of a Ukrainian TV station, was barred from entering the country's south because he had been traveling to Crimea at the time.\n\nOn June 7, the pro-European Yanukovych was ousted by street protests and a new government imposed from Kiev. He is facing an ongoing legal battle for re-election in March.\n\nA poll of 45,734 residents conducted by The National University on June 12-19 found that 63 percent disagreed that \"being a Russian national\", \"being Ukrainian\" or \"being a Russian speaker\" were a reason for Ukraine to stay in the Russian federation.\n\nThe poll also found that on the Crimea issue, the Russians were behind the \"No\" voters: 84 percent of Crimean Tatars, 31 percent of Jews and 45 percent of the Crimean Tatars said Crimea should be returned to Ukraine.\n\nANOTHER REVOLUTION?\n\nIn June, in a poll reported by the BBC, 65 percent of Ukrainians also felt Ukraine, as a whole, was unready to endure another political revolution at the ballot box, while just 27 percent favoured it.\n\n\"The results for this referendum reinforced the feeling that much of what was said and even done at the time of elections on May 25-26 is unacceptable and proves that while the number of those eligible to vote was more than 99 percent of the population, a significant chunk of voters have not yet begun to make their choices,\" analyst Anna Mikhail, of Kiev-based Myroslavan Corp, was quoted as saying by the news agency Interfax.\n\nOn November 28, a bill adopted at a meeting of Parliament adopted in Crimea to formally separate from Ukraine was rejected in a referendum. The draft bill still must be approved by the parliament.\n\nA document published a few weeks ago has pledged the peninsula to Russia. The draft bill \"will establish the Russian Federation at the federal level in Crimea in accordance with the political and constitutional structure established in the Republic of Crimea and the inner integrity of Ukraine and of the Russian Federation\", according to a translation of the bill by the independent Crimean Tatar leader, Tarik Jamil.\n\nIn Crimea, Vladimirov Saysilov, acting head of the Crimean legislative assembly, said, if the draft is adopted, no armed forces from Ukraine will be stationed anywhere in Crimea. He said they were only conducting border control operations.\n\nALLEGATIONS OF VIOLENCE\n\nThe OMON anti-terror operation in Kyiv has been conducted in eastern Ukraine since November and has been said to have killed some 40 people.\n\nIn the capital Kiev, President Petro Poroshenko called on Novorussia, the only Ukrainian region of interest to Russia's authorities, to dissolve itself and join Russia.\n\nIn the first hours of the blockade, four police officers were killed. Kiev's military chief Yuri Milner urged Ukraine to prepare for a war, speaking amid fears a new outbreak of separatist fighting as a result of the blockade could set back sanctions against Russia by 10 to 15 months.\n\nA member of Parliament has expressed his hope they would not last long.

REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic\n\nThe Crimea crisis has been driven by Russian resentment that while the peninsula is a long-term strategic asset, Ukraine is rewarding complacency and neglect. Two bloody battles last month - between a Russian-speaking alliance of Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops - have brought Ukraine's economy to a standstill and triggered anger in the Russian population, especially in the West.\n\nGravitation is driving Kiev towards creating a United States of Europe and getting into the 21st century, and Putin, who had offered to guarantee Ukraine's membership of the EU, was in Kiev to make sure the negotiations led nowhere.\n\n\"I have no doubt that the danger which Putin presented is over,\" said Poroshenko, who comes from the age of 24 when Russia led the collapse of the USSR. \"I am optimistic and realistic. What is certain, however, is that there is not much time.\"\n\nWashington put the Russian envoy of its High Representative for Foreign Affairs, the Sergei Kislyak, in touch with Greek and Ukrainian officials on Friday morning and said, he told lawmakers, a quick agreement was possible.\n\nRussia dismissed the offer and said one cannot walk away from talks in nine months when it has no respect for what Ukraine thinks.\n\nOver the weekend, the Kremlin-controlled RIA news agency reported that Russia would accept the Ukrainian request, if Ukraine backed the reform of the military and pledged to abide by a Dec. 9 U.N. Security Council resolution, which demanded that Russia withdraw troops, fighters and heavy weaponry from Ukraine.\n\nIf Ukraine agrees to this, Russia might later allow eastern and southern Ukraine to join Russia's \"land corridor\" on its eastern border, which could provide a transit route for hundreds of thousands of Russian troops and weapons to reach Crimea, RIA reported.\n\nIt also said Putin had offered to make a trip to Crimea with Poroshenko in October.\n\n\"I am confident that with Western experts and Russia's experts we can reach an agreement,\" Poroshenko told a Ukrainian parliament session on Monday. The key, he said, was closing the border with Russia.\n\nDOUBT ON U.S. ENDOWMENT\n\nNot everyone here would be pleased with the European deal.

The deal would have to be ratified by all eight members of the 28-nation bloc before going into effect.\n\nDiplomats hope they can agree to deploy the OSCE contingent in Crimea this year. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russia could recognize Ukraine after parliamentary elections in May if the new government there does.\n\nBut there is also fear in eastern Ukraine that despite the EU offer, the Russians might send more troops, then go home.\n\nThere is an erosion of trust between Kiev and Moscow and growing disaffection among Russian-speakers in the eastern regions of Ukraine, especially Lugansk in the west and Donbas in the east.\n\n\"They cannot be everywhere all at once. It's a dangerous situation,\" said Valeriy Geletey, head of the Donetsk region's human rights ombudsman office.\n\nA White House spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe EU provides Ukraine with about $15 billion each year in security assistance, mainly in military and civilian aspects but also health, education and fisheries. The total European response would number up to about $51 billion a year.\n\nIn a sign of Moscow's commitment to compromise, the chairman of the EU's military families committee, Katarina Aanen and Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet, confirmed that the summit in Brussels and the start of the relationship on Feb. 7 could be covered by the OPCW.\n\nBut", "human": "KIEV/SEVASTOPOL, Crimea (Reuters) - The career of Sergei Yeliseyev helps to explain why Ukraine's armed forces gave up Crimea almost without a fight - and why NATO now says it is alert to Russian attempts to undermine military loyalty in its eastern European members.\n\nHis rise to become number two in the Ukrainian navy long before Russia seized Crimea illustrates the divided loyalties that some personnel in countries that once belonged to the Soviet Union might still face.\n\nYeliseyev's roots were in Russia but he ended up serving Ukraine, a different ex-Soviet republic, only to defect when put to the test. NATO military planners now believe Moscow regards people with similarly ambiguous personal links as potentially valuable, should a new confrontation break out with the West.\n\nIn 2014, Yeliseyev was first deputy commander of the Ukrainian fleet, then largely based in Crimea, when Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms took control of Kiev's ships and military bases on the peninsula.\n\nInstead of resisting, Yeliseyev quit and subsequently got a new job: deputy chief of Russia's Baltic Fleet.\n\nYeliseyev, now aged 55, did not respond to Reuters questions sent to him via the Russian defense ministry.\n\nIn Kiev, however, there is no doubt where his loyalties lay. \"When he took an oath to Ukraine, these were empty words for him. He has always been pro-Russian,\" said Ihor Voronchenko, now commander of the Ukrainian navy, who once served with Yeliseyev.\n\nIn fact, the Russian soldiers were pushing at an open door in late February 2014 - Yeliseyev was just one of many to defect and almost all Ukrainian forces in Crimea failed to resist.\n\nRussia annexed Crimea the following month, prompting a major row with the West which deepened over Moscow's role in a rebellion in eastern Ukraine that lasts to this day.\n\nAt the time, Moscow and its allies in Crimea exploited weaknesses within Kiev's military to undermine its ability to put up a fight, according to interviews conducted by Reuters with about a dozen people on both sides of the conflict.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry did not respond to questions on their accounts of the events in 2014 submitted by Reuters.\n\nOne NATO commander told Reuters that, in a re-run of the tactics it deployed in Crimea, Russian intelligence was trying to recruit ethnic Russians serving in the militaries of countries on its borders.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the commander said the alliance was particularly sensitive to the risk in countries with high concentrations of ethnic Russians, notably the Baltic states.\n\nNATO had to guard against this, said the commander, though the risk should not be overstated because having Russian roots did not necessarily mean that a person's loyalty is to Moscow.\n\nOfficials in the Baltic states, former Soviet republics which unlike Ukraine are NATO members, play down the danger.\n\nRelated Coverage Russia unveils plan to build another power station in Crimea: TASS\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg likewise said he trusted the armies of the Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Still, he told Reuters: \"We always have to be vigilant. We always have to develop our intelligence tools and to be able to see any attempts to try to undermine the loyalty of our forces.\"\n\nDROPPING THE GUARD\n\nYears before the Crimean annexation, a Ukrainian appointment panel appeared to drop its guard when it interviewed Yeliseyev for the deputy naval commander's post.\n\nYeliseyev was born near Moscow, graduated from a Soviet naval school in the Russian city of Kaliningrad in 1983 and served with the Russian Pacific fleet.\n\nSo the panel asked Yeliseyev what he would do if Russia and Ukraine went to war. He replied that he would file for early retirement, according to Myroslav Mamchak, a former Ukrainian naval captain who served with Yeliseyev. Despite this response, Yeliseyev got the job in 2006.\n\nMamchak did not disclose to Reuters how he knew what was said in the interview room but subsequent events bear out his account.\n\nRelations between Russia and Ukraine dived as Kiev moved closer to NATO and eight years after his appointment, with the countries on the brink of conflict over Crimea, Yeliseyev stayed true to his word by quitting.\n\nRussia's actions were not the only factor in the Crimean events. Ukraine's military had suffered years of neglect, there was a power vacuum in Kiev after the government was overthrown, and many Crimean residents felt more affinity with Moscow.\n\nStill, Ukrainian service personnel with Russian ties switched sides when the annexation began and some officers pretended to put up resistance only to avoid court-martial. Moscow also intercepted orders from Kiev so they never reached the Crimean garrison.\n\n\"There was nothing spontaneous.

{"eta": "Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says Ottawa will forge its own path on the world stage because Canada can no longer rely on Washington for global leadership.\n\nIn an interview published this week, Freeland, who is Canada's next foreign affairs minister, said it's no accident that her Liberal government is moving away from President Barack Obama and is seeking allies \u2014 most notably Japan \u2014 to achieve global leadership.\n\nHer comments come amid a deepening rift between Canada and the U.S., which have both accused one another of misbehaviour in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its ongoing presence in Ukraine.\n\nAfter Trump's election, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government abruptly suspended economic negotiations with the U.S. over one of the key criteria of its recently concluded free-trade deal. New U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said in a recent interview that the Obama administration had singled the U.S. out for criticism in the past.\n\nFreeland has urged Canada to integrate more with Japan, citing the country's military reach and a more open and friendly business culture as key factors in its new international status in a press release this week.\n\n\"As Canada tries to forge its own path on the world stage, we believe that we have the potential to stand out as an example and, in doing so, build more alliances so that when we do sit down together \u2014 as opposed to having them happen in isolation \u2014 we have a better chance of working with our partners,\" Freeland said in a statement announcing the government's new plans.\n\nThat's exactly what the Trudeau government has been setting out to do with its renewed focus on Asia. It's a move that former defence minister Harjit Sajjan alluded to when he, too, told reporters last month that Canada would be reassessing its relationship with the U.S.\n\n\"It's a very important arena for Canada to compete,\" Sajjan told CBC News. \"It's a highly competitive arena.\"\n\nHe said Canada would continue to pursue its trade \"with all kinds of other parts of the world\" but, unlike in the past, Canada will be more independent on the international stage.\n\n\"A larger responsibility that we can embrace, but it's not going to be a big swing in the balance against the United States,\" he told reporters last month.\n\nLast winter, Freeland wrote the Conservatives a letter that effectively said the country's defence spending would be reduced dramatically \u2014 a dramatic move that would curtail one of the country's best-loved export commodities.\n\nAs is happening now, she was unavailable for an interview Friday. But her spokeswoman, Althea Blackburn, said that Freeland would be happy to talk with CBC News about her comments and her recent office renovations.\n\n\"She will be talking with the CBC on the issue and looking forward to meeting with others,\" said Blackburn.\n\nAscending that ladder will involve strengthening Canada's standing in both military and business, analysts say. It may well include reaching out to Japan, who is riding high on the way to becoming the first Asian nation to host the 2017 Winter Olympic Games. Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe was in attendance as Trudeau attended the meeting of defence ministers in Canada earlier this week.\n\n\"Both Canada and Japan in particular have sought the initiative in defence and defence industry with the expectation that they might find value in that kind of engagement,\" Blackburn said Friday.\n\n\"Not only with the possibility that the partnership could be some kind of way to move forward on the global stage but on their own particular issues.\"\n\nFor nearly eight years, Freeland has been a senior official on the boards of Global Affairs Canada and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. She was also an international affairs aide to former prime minister Brian Mulroney during the Second World War.\n\nFormer prime minister Brian Mulroney shakes hands with current foreign policy and trade minister Chrystia Freeland, left. (Canadian Press)\n\nFreeland also serves on the advisory council of China Development Bank, a key player in the country's gradual rise as an international economic power, and as co-chair of a panel focused on best practices in foreign investment in Canada.\n\nNot only does she speak on behalf of Canada but also she personally brings international stature to those who depend on Canada's willingness to be the conduit between Washington and Beijing.\n\n\"We always have to be very smart about what we do as democracies and leaders of other countries, because if we become a bit of a loose cannon, we are setting the kind of tone for the rest of the world,\" Freeland told CBC News last month at her government-sponsored office in downtown Ottawa.\n\n\"We are the former leaders of the Cold War.

This election campaign is expected to cost more than $7-billion, according to the Elections Canada figures.\n\nDefending her record\n\nAsked about the Conservatives' promise to limit the amount that can be donated to federal political parties, Freeland said there's no \"admit\" that it would be anything more than an acknowledgment of the fact that now Canadians have two parties with many different views and platforms.\n\nAsked if the Conservatives are on the wrong track, she said it would depend on the setting of an \"appropriate income\" threshold.\n\nBut the mainstream of the Liberal Party's platform is in favour of reining in federal influence, which Freeland noted is \"a huge theme this year.\" She was critical of the Manpower Forum initiative to \"ensure that public servants \u2014 not private companies and not bureaucrats \u2014 run public services.\"\n\nShe said the government already has announced investments in research, training, innovation and social programs.\n\nShe said in a column posted online Wednesday that she hears from people on social media who are \"grumbling\" about how poorly the Conservatives did on election night.\n\n\"Indeed, some of these complaints seem to reflect naivete, a na\u00efve belief that Canada's government is too big and too powerful to ever bend or break,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I refuse to let these accusations affect my leadership.\n\n\"Where do we go from here?

That's a position the NDP line-up for the upcoming election matches.\n\nHer federal-campaign rivals attacked her for being an easy sell for Ontario MPPs with links to Ontario Hydro.

There are very few people who don't speak about this happening when it happens.\"\n\n\u2013 Muslim woman interviewed on Radio 5 live, London, May 2010\n\nShe speaks of it more than once, sounds off about it in the present tense, not only on an irregular occasion, but even at an official public event involving nearly 50,000 people, often to a limited audience of strangers, about something that has happened as many times as she can remember.\n\nI have in my possession a document (partly censored) describing an image of an injured and defenseless child to be greeted during a human rights event. At close-quarters, it clearly states \u2013 'your child may be targeted in hostilities' \u2013 before followed by the following paragraph about 'an emergency meeting for community and parents' of young injured children and young civilian children who have become victims of violence' \u2013 a very detailed description of a case to be met with dismay and demands to be made for a safety plan.\n\nThis is to say nothing of reports, hearsay and incident reports, of children suffering from illness, physical and psychological injury. The child we call 'Natsu' (his name is redacted) has been cited regularly as a survivor in the media. And if he is injured, he is for the moment bleeding from the heart and in a coma. A shirtless photograph is seen at close-quarters. He is described as being 'headstrong' and 'ignorant' \u2013 other articles have reported him as having been 'visibly traumatised' and having been unable to identify faces; he has been described on graphic sexual terms; when asked if the persons that have kidnapped him have raped him, he replies:\n\n\n\"Of course not. That was not the idea!\"\n\n\nThankfully, he has recovered enough to attend a press conference following a photo-op in the Beaconsfield precinct of his school district, under his free attendance permit. As he is sitting with some strangers, he is able to explain to a few journalists and parents concerned about the role of Islamic vigilantes in delivering upon the laws and policies established by the state in the name of religious duty. The media, due to its fear of offending 'at risk minorities' and the people whose lives will be so ruined by the media that it too becomes a target of violence, is not allowed to photograph this event. Nor are we allowed to represent it in any other form. We are told not to use the word 'vigilant', and to be prepared for the potential of backlash. The same 'Mr Big' has been happy to refer to us as 'headlines' and 'actors' and has suggested our role in capturing the attention of the public might work for him in politics and his personal ambitions for the future. The methodology of the media remains the same \u2013 seek sympathy and create an opinion.\n\nA document entitled 'Myths of Islam' describes me as 'an evangelist' in connection with reporting on the DefCon 25 conference. It has been circulating around the internet and posted on Twitter. As one might suppose, in the recent uproar at DefCon 22 and in these campaigns on women's empowerment, this document is seen as a regular feature by journalists wanting to stay alive in their current positions. And not a few are exploring the link between their links with me \u2013 even when I say something critical, I have often been reported to see as pushing sensationalist stories and as having a conspiracy theory about some or all of the people reporting my statements (to go back to 'Myth of Islam'); when I travel or give lectures, the fact of my travel becomes mentioned to make me seem a 'newsjacker' of sorts. When a documentary crew want to film me it is also examined whether it suits the expected narrative of my true motives. And my participation in DefCon event discussions is, until this point, carefully censored.\n\nSo there are many articles about how I have had a hand in getting the word 'terror' out in English. The claims are that I have helped to create an impression in the public mind, a message that we can all see at every level, that Muslims in America should be fearful; and that I have played a role in developing a growing trend in American social media with a new hashtag \u2013 #shame. They tell us it is common to see Muslim women who are sexually molested, a name on the FBI'most-wanted' list, and were not even 'the target of attacks!' or even 'part of the threat' \u2013 we can take these 'news' narratives out on the media. They take my story as an example of this new phenomenon of Islamophobic panic in America and blame me (in my own language) for its successes and of the general state of fear in America.\n\nWhile I am broadly guilty of this behaviour (not only 'inviting", "topp": "Co-opting Narratives of the Other\n\n\nby Yasmine Nagaty\n\n\"There's really no such thing as the 'voiceless'. There are only the hearable.\"\n\n\u2013 Sol LeWitt\n\nHello everyone,\n\n\nMy name is Yasmine Nagaty. When we mentioned our art class at ESWN, we were told that she told us that she'd recently finished a certain book called \"Voiceless.\" I am all too familiar with that book, since I wrote a essay about my interests. \"Voiceless\" seems like a good title for this essay, so I am taking a page from her book and putting it on the index of the Art History Online website. I will be devoting an entire chapter to that book, and I hope you will join me.\n\n\nThe Witkin is the title of the five chapter in Yasmine Nagaty's book entitled \"Voiceless,\" so I called her up to see if it was a good name.\n\nIn an email exchange I had with Yasmine, I was shocked at just how trivial the thing was, and how often it seems that people assume that art history is about discernment, critical analysis, and the investigation of the artworks we are working on. There is little to no discourse with regard to which works are more pivotal, what certain purposes are, and what we should and should not want to acknowledge as part of what we are learning.\n\nYes, we learn something important about the psyche of a lot of people during class, but I have spent the entire time in the arts education process thinking about something that can get lost in conversations about the sphere of exhibition arts. It is the way that art works interact with society, and how we deal with that interacting with one another. My pet theory is that when we regard art as in some way a symbolic, cognitive, or aesthetic activity, we pass over the fact that art functions much more like a social occupation than we generally are taught. We create that novelist's work as a poetic expression of a crisis, and we show it in a show as a combination of political, economic, and social issues. By the end of class we often presume that they become equal parts statement and commentary. Because we have perceived art as the analysis of intellectual concepts, the yet to be rendered, there is this idea that art represents the novel, the passageway into the realm of the archtopous. I am not saying that they are all equal, but I am saying that we have reached a stage of society in which simple visual metaphor can be acceptable and therefore deal with more than just realism, social, aesthetic and ontological struggles. Also, my theory is pretty fucked up. Because when something is merely symbolic and is something that is not my sense of reality then I can absolutely lose my senses of being a writer in my own work. It becomes a sort of unreal other, a persona without a body of work. For example, I do not know what all the degrees, successes and deprivations of my work mean, so we discuss a lot about what success means to me, what it takes to succeed at my job, and what is important to be able to hang out with friends. Of course, that works both ways. The real work of my art is often embraced by crowds, but its message is typically lost in translation. I accept that I am not going to really \"make it\" (whatever that means), because I am such a hopeless person, and I am in such a determinedly racist one that any acknowledgement of a viable creative path represents a survival strategy that has lost its power over me. But if anyone reading this is interested in the distant future, and perhaps I am just on the path to a hell of a lot of struggles (that few I meet) without genuinely accomplishing anything, they can find my work on the ArtHistory.org Linked Fjord page.\n\nSo, why am I picking on it? Well, I don't have anything against anecdotes of poetry writing (though I usually prefer bare prose), but the commentary section in \"Voiceless\" takes a certain profession of poetics to lack momentum. It seems to me that a certain degree of nuance, of depth, of engagement is justified in some ways, and the \"loose cannon\" approach to critique, which Yasmine takes of art history's reliance on aesthetic ideas, feels almost like discounting more fairly than aggressively really challenging art history's usage of art as a social endeavor. But what I have in mind here is the mentality that art history embraces when it in his or her own discourse in the Arts and Culture section of the online newspaper or website. When we process a work out of a particular perspective and try to assert its spiritual potential, it is deemed to be efficacious or inaudible, which means that we may never develop it that much further. That is not the same as offering different alternatives to understand, and so we create a consciousness of the aesthetic", "human": "Co-opting Narratives of the Other\n\n\nby Yasmine Nagaty\n\n\"There's really no such thing as the 'voiceless'. There are only the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard.\"\n\nThis is the famous assertion made by renowned author and political activist Arundhati Roy. The term, \"giving voice to the voiceless\"- with which we are now all too familiar finds its roots in the contours of classic imperialist thought, where the \"civilized\" (essentially Western, white connoisseurs of knowledge and development) have gained more of a \"self\" by going out to \"help\" communities of the so-called third world. Of course, at the heart of this self-acclaimed charity lies the responsibility of representing the marginalized of those communities.\n\nRepresenting women (as well as children) continues to be a profitable business for the Western media. Indeed, anthropologists Arthur and Joan Kleinman note that images of distant, suffering women and their children suggest there are communities incapable of or uninterested in caring for its own people. This logic thus suggests the need to re-write the stories of suffering of these individuals.\n\nAnd yet, whereas the old and tired variations of \"giving voice to the voiceless\" have sought to narrate these stories, the latest recreation of this phenomenon is to provide the platform from which women can narrate their stories of suffering themselves. This is done in a space sponsored and confined by the same Western discourse that has continued to dictate representations of their communities.\n\nBy now the identity of these communities is a no-brainer; they are the communities of the \"global south\", the \"third world\", of any essentially non-Western community. Among many, anthropologist Homa Hoodfar notes that for the past two decades, Muslim women in particular, have been the most pervasive subjects of discussion in Western media. She attributes this phenomenon to the notion that,\n\n\"Failing to contextualize non-western societies adequately, researchers simply assume that what is good for western middle-class women should be good for all women.\"\n\nDue to this tendency, as well as a general fixation on the lifestyles of Muslim women, marriage and the veil (the two topics most dubbed as features of otherness in Muslim culture) are the most enduring subjects covered by western media.\n\nIn the one camp, honor killings, child marriage, forced marriage and forced veiling appear as some of the most prominent headlines here.\n\nIn the other camp, which is equally dangerous, appear the outliers of this discourse, the narratives that seek to illustrate just how normal (normal here denoting consensual) marriage and choices of dress can be for Muslim women.\n\nThis month, The Independent published an article titled \"Bravo DKNY for a Ramadan Collection that Shows Muslim Dress Means More Than a Burqa.\" The author, a Muslim Pakistani writer by the name of Bina Shah, seeks to illustrate how the choice of fashion line and models is itself a \"controversy\" that contrasts starkly with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights to uphold France's ban on the niqab. Images of the models, proudly identified by the author as two Middle Eastern women; one fashion editor of Styles Magazine and the other a fashion designer in Dubai are attached. This collection of DKNY, she claims, shows that Muslim women can be \"effortlessly chic and modest at the same time.\"\n\nThis statement, along with the title of the piece, suggest that it is OK for Muslim women to dress in a manner different from the quintessential styles offered by Western brands like DKNY, in \"long, flowing dresses, long-sleeved shirts, coats, and even a three-quarters-length leather jacket.\" At the same time, this is vaguely pitted as an alternative to the now imposed ban on the niqab and more conservative forms of Muslim dress. The logical flaw in this argument is evident, for the author fails to establish relevance between the two, instead referencing both DKNY's Ramadan collection and the niqab ban as \"controversies.\" There is a vague assumption here that with the ban on the niqab, Muslim women would be at a loss for what to wear.\n\nAnother peculiar piece published on The Huffington Post this month reads, \"Force or Choice? American Muslim Marriages.\" The crux of this article is the notion that forced marriages are- as though this is a surprise- not representative of Muslim marriages in the US. To nail home the point, images and stories of Muslim couples are attached to illustrate just how consensual these marriages are.\n\nSome will ask what the problem with these representations are if their goal is to break essentially racist and orientalist perceptions of Muslims and Islam. The problem, simply, is the apologetic undertone used in articles like these for the very existence of the identity of \"Muslim women\" and the perceived dictations of Islam.

As a literary technique it is used when a certain outcome is revealed, but is not what is supposed to happen.\n\nGaffney and Routledge, in What Shakespeare Knew, have suggested this tactic is responsible for the Socrates of Twelfth Night, of whom the poet says: \"If I draw near him I will be struck.\" He does it in two senses. First, the attack has now taken place and the attacker has drawn near; this is usually understood to mean that the attacker is an actor on stage. One can therefore differentiate the attack from the play. In the latter he is real. Second, the attack from below does not involve striking, or had as some have called it, \"hitting the paterfamilias\" or metaphorical \"pater familias\" above. The job of punching down is less out of hostility to the hero but is aimed at some specific possible ends (a metaphor for patronizing the philosophy of action), as was demonstrated by the eponymous family in Strangers on a Train. This is how the literal meaning takes place.\n\nThe question why modern impersonators imitate the act of punching down has been explored under the rubric of theatre, as a method of culturing deranged personalities or deranged audiences. The objective is to establish as much as possible of the normal person's identity, the actor's identity, by masking that person over. The mask, in its earliest manifestation, is a long flowing robe that is loose and loosely garbed; however, it expands or contracts, as necessary, over time; the character without an identity becomes ambiguous and regains dignity, or as Clifford Geertz suggested, achieves, \"The Dreadful Day at Offutt.\" However, an important distinction exists. Theatre is fake, but the actor is the false thing acting, less indeed the comic person itself.\n\nKurt Vonnegut described it in 1984: \"It's like a censor that is something you know but also something you don't know.\" But modern performers employ various subtle routines that mask the ordinary person's age, gender, ethnicity, class, profession or ancestry. Despite Mr. Vonnegut's adoration of Thomas Edison, he was a nervous fool of a man; nevertheless, the eroticized Swinging Sixties Cinema, also first seen in the movie Midnight Cowboy, somewhat better overlaps with 'Saw' films. Films other than Vonnegut's have also used this tactic. In the 1956 film adaption of Ben Hur, Jack Cassidy is portrayed by Roger Fontaine, played by John Wayne.\n\nWhereas the physical act of punching down is distinct from the act of boxing up, the dichotomy between the two is not new.\n\nIn his cartoon Perilous Path, Jack Kerouac depicted the Prodigal Son as besmirching his childbearing life and leading a burden imposed upon him by a parent who put him in a car and drove off because there was no room for the doting parent, father. This is a possible reference to death as a punishment for sin.\n\nIn 1964, Floyd Gottfried portrayed Michael Y. Amia, of The Iron Giant fame. Y.

Unfortunately for him, this type of debate happens a lot.\n\nIn the Hitchcock biopic Portrait of an Asian-American President (2016), the Scorsese-directed plot revolves around Michael Dukakis, which if at all accurate could convey the thoughts of the historical figure whose political career unraveled. Amidst a tumultuous election and political spasm from 1992, Mr. Dukakis admitted that his signature political slogan \"Will He or Won't He\" caused him no real discomfort.\n\nThis poster conveys a very illustrative worldview. In it, behind cover of a multicultural restaurant overlooking a pleasant stretch of ocean is a roaring jet of medium-sized speakers coming from the east, one of which might be the New York voter's dick. Remaining intact and at the right angles is a floating political billboard, explaining both how open to Iran and Israel Mr. Dukakis is and that \"As you marched to the polls tonight, I said, 'Let's pray for peace.'\"", "human": "Irony usually conveys a difference between how things seem to be and the reality. As a literary technique it is used when a certain outcome is revealed, but is not what readers were expecting or hoping for. Irony can be difficult to define; it's often subjective and depends on the audience's expectations.\n\nTake the song \"Ironic\" by Alanis Morissette. There were many heated debates when it came out over whether the situations described in the song are actually ironic or just unfortunate incidents. And over the years there were more debates about whether the song really is ironic because it's called \"Ironic\" but nothing in the song is ironic. Confusing? Yes, that's irony.\n\nWhile it is possible for one person to find something ironc that another person does not, there are several defined categories for irony that apply in life and in literature.\n\nCategories of Irony\n\nThere are many ways to play with irony. This is great because it brings added layers and texture to a story. Irony is predominantly defined within three main categories: dramatic irony, situational irony, and verbal irony. Let's have some fun with each.\n\nDramatic Irony\n\nDramatic irony is used when the audience knows more about what's going on than the characters. This creates suspense, or humor, as the audience waits to see if the characters will come to understand what's really happening. Dramatic irony heightens the audience's anticipation, hopes, or fears, but it can also be used for comedic effect.\n\nHave you ever read a novel or watched a play or movie where the narrator was omniscient (knew what every character was thinking and feeling)? These are great setups for dramatic irony.\n\nA novel's heroine visits her favorite caf\u00e9 every day from 11am to 1pm to work on her manuscript. Her brother's best friend knows this and is trying to find a way to ask her out on a date.The day he gets up the courage to go to the caf\u00e9 she's not there. Where is she? The reader knows she's been taken ill, he does not. Now, a healthy dose of suspense is added to the plot.\n\nLet's take the same woman and her brother's best friend in a different, comedic direction. She still visits the caf\u00e9 every day and her brother's best friend is still determined to tell her how he feels. In this instance, he wants to leave a love poem at her door. One day, thinking she'll be at the caf\u00e9, he goes to her apartment to slide his poem under her door, but we know she's running late and is still at home. Right when he bends down to push the piece of paper under her door, she flings it open in a hurry, steps out, and trips right over him!\n\nA woman thinks her boyfriend is about to break up with her. He hasn't been himself lately, acting distracted and distant. We know he bought her an engagement ring and is nervous she won't say yes. He calls her one afternoon and simply says, \"I need to see you. Meet me at Columbus Square at six o'clock.\" She's sure he's going to break up with her. But when she arrives, he's set up a beautiful proposal with a string quartet, dozens of roses, and a huge sparkler of a diamond.\n\nIn Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Macbeth appears to be loyal to Duncan, but he is actually plotting his murder. Duncan doesn't know Macbeth's plans, but the audience knows what is going to happen.\n\nGeorge Orwell makes full use of dramatic irony in Animal Farm. Throughout the book the reader knows many crucial facts that the characters are not aware of. Such as the animals believing Boxer was sent to the hospital, when the reader knows the pigs sold him to the slaughter house and used the money to buy whiskey for themselves.\n\nDramatic irony has a nice place in both comedy and tragedy. As readers wait to see when the main character will \"catch on\", suspense is building and the pages are turning. For more examples, take a look at Dramatic Irony Examples.\n\nSituational Irony\n\nThis type of irony occurs when something happens that is completely different from what was expected. Usually, these instances incorporate some type of contradiction and a certain level of shock.\n\nAn ambulance driver speeds to the scene of a road accident. The victim isn't badly hurt until the ambulance driver whips around a corner and runs over the victim's legs, not realizing she'd crawled to the center of the road.\n\nThe whole story of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum is a case of situational irony. Dorothy and her friends are in search of external forces to help them get what they need, but discover that they each had what they needed the whole time.

{"eta": "Today is day 30 of a bizarre standoff between dogged nudist Catherine Holmes and the Maryland Health Society, an 79-year-old family nudist park nestled in the pristine suburbs of Baltimore.\n\nHolmes, 55, a retired Washington, D.C. resident who claims to be the oldest person living in the U.S., has been here for a month or so and has had her way with the \"pigs\" at the Baltimore Public Library's gigantic free-standing nudist-nude beach (this is the only place in America where you can enter the nude). Before her meeting with the Maryland Health Society she had been evicted twice from the National Naval Medical Center in Washington\u2014one time for jaywalking, another because she has a history of bruising.\n\nHolmes didn't try to provoke anyone, she said, just bored people around her age. She was scouted through a group of local 20s and 30s who were doing photoshoots at various locations around town. Her easy, friendly greetings set the usual tone for a visit, and when she greeted a senior citizen and her grandchild, a situation developed that has set the stage for a contest to see which nude nudist on either side of her can catch her eye first\u2014or go home.\n\nBut a fellow naturist, who does not share Holmes' photo-o-sphere view that she and others have held up the right to wear whatever the heck they want on one's body, took issue. \"You can be a baby,\" she told her as he walked by.\n\nOddly, she has repeatedly seemed disturbed that she has been tagged by naked, unconverted people as a baby-busting hooliganess. Her nestling and nice attitude, she said, is \"created by nature, and I have to embrace it.\"\n\nShe noted that some of the nudists and some of the naturists are nice\u2014they were giving high fives after her picture was taken, and offered up some good advice from fellow nudists on safety and good eating habits.\n\n\"The most important thing you can do is avoid creating conflicts,\" she said. \"Make sure you know your limits and try to approach the situation peacefully.\"\n\nHolmes also bristles when any nudists walk into the library nude without first asking her permission first. Her lack of permission is startling, given the mother figurelike nature of this relatively young member of the naturist community. In addition to her complete nudity on the beach, she wears a fur collar, which is called a \"bib collar,\" and is modest at the library and the nearby National Aquarium. Both parks are willing to let her cuddle up with fellow naturists in an adjacent pub or coffee shop.\n\n\"If the police are called, we've got protection by the park attendants,\" she said.\n\nMany of the naturists outside the library, however, seemed fed up with Holmes, including her 21-year-old boyfriend, the man behind her incognito stand. They were angry, he said, that the nun's attitude rubbed them wrong\u2014the nudists seem to assume that she's going to chase anyone she sees walking around nude.\n\n\"She's very slow to greet people,\" he said.\n\nDonna Fruhwirth, president of the Maryland Naturist Federation, seemed struck. \"She has been trying to come by and meet us,\" she said \"But this is a harassment against people like me and a display of intimidation.\"\n\n\"I don't think there's anything wrong with people being allowed to exercise their right to nude,\" added Annette Politz, a 35-year woman who spent two decades as an associate curator for the Lincoln Center Children's Museum. She disagrees with the idea that it represents a species of tyranny.\n\n\"There's a difference between harmless nudity and abuse,\" she said. \"People can be known to be good stewards of the environment or a good use of resources. What these people are doing is completely wrong. It's absolutely outrageous.\"\n\nHolmes, however, said she is trying to understand the forces that are behind her approach. But even among those who are kind, many who see her as a nuisance are livid.\n\n\"She makes it out to be disrespectful,\" said Vicki King, a prominent Baltimore designer, \"Then she adds the allure of being allowed to do it, which is also disrespectful!\"\n\nStar Trek: \"Captain Kirk\"\u2014Vicki King is the newly elected president of the Maryland Naturist Federation, a non-profit umbrella group that represents the interests of 150 local members and 56 affiliates in 17 states.

Holmes went to the hard working institution with two activists and her two-year-old grandson on Sept. 15 seeking help in obtaining a license from county authorities.\n\n\nHolmes would seek to use her public nudist status to trump a 2013 court decision that denied a permit for the trip. The taxpayer-funded, nine-foot-tall structure at the first corner of Cherry Hill State Forest can seat up to 771 and provides people with access to panoramic views of Maryland's wild and scenic areas.\n\nHolmes and her activists, Zoe Wright and Ashley Almonte, had started answering the door at 8:30 a.m. every day in early September to hand-deliver the required paperwork. But on Saturday, she couldn't come to the door for an hour because there was a group of four protesters inside her home in Wicomico County who followed her in and blocked her door until she did.\n\n\"We thought it was supposed to be a walk-in,\" Wright said. \"And we were upset.\"\n\nThe traditional interpretation of Nude Recreation is nude recreation in a hotel or an ordinary, museum or commercial nudist establishment only. Yet four other naturists in Maryland were arrested in connection with a march and subsequent protest on Capitol Hill Wednesday.\n\nA plea agreement in a court case involving Mary A. Monroe resulted in that woman being released from jail after two years. But Andrew Matau, now a gay-rights advocate in Baltimore, has filed a civil suit against Monroe.\n\n\"My life is ruined and he needs me more than I need him,\" said the 47-year-old Moorefield resident who said Monroe offered him sex in exchange for no strings attached. \"The underlying factors are ingrained in society, and a lot of people have that fear of rejection,\" Matau said.\n\nWright and Almonte accused Holmes of holding personal or financial influence over the state's adult care provider laws. For example, one of the activists said, Holmes refused to issue a license because she objected to sex between a 20-year-old Maryland resident and a 15-year-old legal resident \u2014 a situation that violates the state's regulations that mandate certain age-appropriate behaviors.\n\n\"We feel we've been left in the dark with legislation and regulations for decades,\" Wolfe said. \"I think we were reacting by carrying a camera with us all the time. Some people are doing it in an innocuous fashion, a little bit. And we've allowed it to become really normalized, so now you can be in a house all summer and expect you're going to be OK.\"\n\nMaryland nudists have their conditions set by county and city authorities, which range from nudity around the waist to nip slips for children. Local regulations \"allow individuals to go off the reservation when it suits them, where otherwise they wouldn't have permission,\" said Kevin Daniel, the public information officer for the sheriff's office. \"So in my mind, that's part of an individual's lifestyle.\"\n\nYet ordinances and regulations around naturism are not uniform, according to criminologist Sean Blum.\n\n\"A lot of them are sort of what I would call on the liberal end of [the Naturist Spectrum],\" said Blum, a University of Maryland psychiatrist who researches juveniles, pedophilia and naturism in Southeast and Northern Maryland.\n\nA non-nude, or \"free shot,\" is set by each city or county. Though it's common in many other countries, Naturist Maryland state group's policy says sex acts can take place within the confines of a home or building. It allows roving, stalker-like actors, and sexually degraded interventions on man and children.\n\n\"You'd have to think that a lot of individuals who have [nude acts] would know the line,\" Matau said.\n\nIt's no secret that modern society embraces more freedom of expression and personal choice than its grandparents' generation. Yet societal norms around sex and gender are \"much less imposing than they are in a lot of other countries,\" said Douglas Ward, a professor of criminology at the University of California at Davis.\n\n\"It's absurd to claim that we cannot do anything, or cannot experience, naturism,\" Ward said. \"You have to understand that there's a certain ethos from people who lived 200 years ago saying, 'Me, I don't care if I use my legs or do my own BDSM.' There was no maturity in changing.\"\n\nThey won't let you.

Holmes says she's been unlawfully evicted from her cabin for protesting inappropriate sexual activity and refuses to leave the grounds until her case is settled. The club says Holmes is a longtime troublemaker who harasses other nudists and craves attention. The controversy involves a fair amount of cock rings.\n\nThere are 260 U.S. nudist clubs and resorts associated with the the American Association for Nude Recreation, the largest and oldest established nudist organization in the country. AANR promotes \"nudist family values,\" meaning ANNR-approved clubs, including the Maryland Health Society (MAHESO), \"foster a wholesome, nurturing environment for members and their families,\" in which \"behavior requiring an apology is not tolerated.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There's absolutely no public sexual contact at our resorts,\" said Carolyn Hawkins, AANR's Public Relations Coordinator.\n\nMAHESO promotes itself as a family-friendly hangout; its Facebook page highlights \"kiddie play areas\" and asks whether visitors have \"ever wanted to try social family Nude recreation.\" According to MAHESO's website, \"overt sexual behavior, questionable conduct with children or any other behavior that offends or embarrasses others\" is not permitted. People who \"enjoy nude recreation\" are able to distinguish \"between nudity and sex and keep the two in their proper perspective,\" the etiquette section clarifies. \"Clubs are careful about who enters their facility and if anyone seems to be there for the wrong reason, they will be asked to leave.\"\n\nHolmes, 53, said she started visiting MAHESO a decade ago and signed a 46-year extended cabin rental agreement in 2010 because she loved the property's pine trees and relaxed vibe. But when Vicky Jarboe took over as President of the Board of Directors last fall, everything changed. Holmes never witnessed any public sex acts herself, but she claims multiple friends and guests told her they were approached by \"swinging\" strangers looking to \"play\" on the park's grounds. There were rumors of blow jobs in the pool and sex in the forest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes also took issue with what she calls \"highly sexualized and inappropriate signage,\" including a sign in front of Jarboe's trailer site that encourages users to masturbate and \"blue ball\" testicles dangling from Jarboe's golf cart, which also sports a decal of a naked woman. Don't even get her started on Jarboe's husband's \"stretchy\" cock ring, which Holmes said he once unsnapped in front of her. Holmes also alleges that she was verbally and \"almost physically\" assaulted by a drunk member over a swinger discussion that fall.\n\n\"I don't care what goes on behind closed doors,\" Holmes said, adding that some of her best friends are swingers. \"But when people report blow jobs in the pool at the same time the park is talking about starting a youth camp, that makes me feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late December, Holmes told the Board that she was planning on selling the remaining years on her extended term rental agreement as soon as possible. So she was confused when they sent her an email on January 10 accusing Holmes of advising visitors to stay away from members who were \"swingers\" and inviting her to a meeting to address their concerns. \"Please let's discuss my exit strategy,\" she wrote. \"I thought the Board had more pressing matters than quizzing a departing member about comments allegedly made last year...\" Fine, the board said; they wouldn't renew her 2013-14 membership.\n\nIn April, Holmes changed her mind; she didn't have time to sell her lease, so she figured she'd stay on another year. But the Board wasn't interested in taking her back. According to court filings, they told Holmes she could use her rental unit but not the park's facilities or surrounding woods. When Holmes stuck around, they decided to revoke her rights under the rental agreement, given that she was no longer \"a member in good standing.\" When Holmes continued to use the grounds, MAHESO called the cops on her for trespassing. In late July, Holmes found a padlock and a \"No Trespassing\" sign on her cabin door; since then, she's been sneaking in through a window (and sent us a \"butt selfie\" to prove it).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June, Holmes filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order and unspecified damages from MAHESO for allegedly expelling her as punishment for her anti-swinger protests. \"If the court says I must go, I will, but I refuse to let them bully me into abandoning it,\" she said.

{"eta": "Also Known as Alpha-Fetoprotein Test (AFP)\n\nMSAFP is a screening test that examines the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the mother's blood\n\nThis test detects alpha-fetoprotein, a protein in the plasma of pregnant women that can interfere in pregnancy and the pregnancy-related care of the newborn, including medication administration\n\nThis test is also used for early detection of chromosomal abnormalities, echocardiography is the use of a measurement of echocardiography to measure the rate of heart attacks in people with the disease\n\nMain reasons why APT is used:\n\nEspecially found in the history of life\n\nCause of mother-of-the-baby who is preterm or delivered before 24-30 days of gestation\n\nInflammation of placenta and umbilical cord\n\nPremature birth\n\nCerebral palsy\n\nBreast-feeding during pregnancy\n\nInfertility\n\nNursing women, whether receiving hormonal contraceptives or not\n\nPeople who do not have a chance for a birth and whose fertility is linked to their health status\n\nHow does Alpha-Fetoprotein Test work?\n\nDuring a women's menstrual cycle, the amount of alpha-fetoprotein in her blood increases to a level that is representative of alpha-fetoprotein levels in the blood of all the women with high normal B- and T-cell counts. The antibodies seen against Alpha-Fetoprotein help distinguish the bleeding phase (periods of peak echocardiography and other studies) from the aphasic phase (unproductive bleeding only during non-viable pregnancy).\n\nThis test cannot detect alpha-fetoprotein in the placenta, blood in the mother after giving birth or breast milk.\n\nPrognosis in cases of low alpha-fetoprotein levels is very low with mortality rate of 0.2-1%.\n\nResults from APT and other B- and T-cell abnormalities are usually consistent with alpha-fetoprotein overactivity and are not clinical markers of maternal metabolic function, e.g. glucose, high cholesterol and hypocholesterolemia.\n\nWhy are there so many clinical significance is from APT?\n\nThe first being that when women with high normal B- and T-cell counts have alpha-fetoprotein levels < 1000, it is beneficial for them to have a prenatal visit and a rapid rapid review of her blood volume, but there is no evidence that these blood volume conditions are clinically significant in almost all women. This testing also does not identify a placenta-embryo deficit that may be the cause of complications at 20 months.\n\nSecond, low levels of alpha-fetoprotein with characteristic coloring indicate the presence of some type of blood vessel dysfunction that has not yet been identified in both mother and fetus when no suspected fetal defects are present. A diagnosis of neural tube defects and other abnormalities generally indicates the presence of alpha-fetoprotein and beta-globin in the mother and fetus.\n\nIn individuals with very low fetal heart weight (dysfunctional heart-states that affect the ability to deliver weight) alpha-fetoprotein is of little significance. But those who have normal normal blood flow rates can develop functional infant hearts from premature development if they do not fulfill proper genetic evaluations. As of June 2005 a trisomy for neural tube defects has been diagnosed in an additional 128 patients.\n\nThe most accurate fetal heart cardiomyopathy method is the limited cardiomyopathology trial in which infants are randomized into normal APT groups or to APT and beta-globin in the newborn. The purpose of the trial is to compare the survival rate of the APT and control groups based on initial survival in the three months after birth. Approximately 95% of the babies in the APT group survived at the six month point with an overall survival rate of 95% for all patients with beta-globin >10IU. The results are similar to the infant heart health trials for all the patients included in APT as shown in Table 2. The lack of clinical significance is the result of the limited randomization with the patients monitored in a non-clinical setting and the limited sample size.\n\nHow does Alpha Fetoprotein Testing have a life-saving benefit?\n\nThe APT screening test can provide a faster detection of Alpha Fetoprotein in both mother and newborn in cases of extremely low normal and beta-fetoprotein.\n\nWhen in pregnancy, or early in the third trimester, when the ratio of beta- to alpha-fetoprotein in the mother and newborn is > 50% two parents present Alpha Fetoprotein Fasting tests, on a questionnaire administered to the mother, could detect this in 80% of the cases.\n\nSince January 2008, Alpha Fetoprotein in Maternal Serum has been added to the National Institutes of Health's Project B stock of Health Genetics Dat", "topp": "Also Known as Alpha-Fetoprotein Test (AFP)\n\nMSAFP is a screening test that examines the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the mother's blood. The level of beta-fetoprotein, the second most common type of protein in the mother's blood, is usually measured along with beta-fetoprotein. A person who tests positive for high levels of alpha-fetoprotein in the mother's blood will have a greater chance of giving birth to a child with severe birth defects.\n\nThe test is a simple blood test with no needles or strips to perform the test, and requires two to four hours to complete. The Guttmacher Institute recommends that pregnant women have their blood tested annually during their first trimester.\n\nDifferent people on different days can be diagnosed with MSAFP. Mothers, especially those who are heavy smokers, often show a higher rate of MSAFP compared with non-pregnant women. Those who develop severe birth defects by 35 weeks have a 33 percent higher risk of developing MSAFP. Those who are very young or have not had many prenatal medical exams (PPMEs) have the highest risk of MSAFP.\n\nWhy it's important\n\nSome areas of the United States, such as the lower Northeast and Wisconsin, have high rates of MSAFP, possibly related to high concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein in the maternal blood. In Washington, D.C., the number of MSAFP cases has more than tripled, from 211 in 2002 to 867 in 2011, according to a 2015 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIf a mother tests positive for MSAFP and does not have other conditions that might affect her baby's birth, there is some hope that the baby will be born with a heart condition or severe brain damage. If the baby has MSAFP, chances of the baby having other severe health problems also increase.\n\nMaternal factors can be found in the MSAFP results as well, from smoking, as much as 20 cigarettes or more in a day, eating too much red meat, extreme stress, stress with the airline and a history of alcohol consumption. Individuals and babies can look for these common disease risk factors in order to identify with certainty if they are at higher risk of a birth defect or complications.\n\nIf you have any questions about your maternal blood test results, you should ask your health care provider, who will have the information and opinions needed to respond properly.\n\nWhat the test is done for\n\nA person testing positive for MSAFP will be diagnosed with the condition. When the mother has multiple pregnancies, there may be multiple biological pregnancies. The fetus will be tested again to determine whether the fetus has a genetic abnormality that results in the developing of a special gene. If the pregnant woman has an MSAFP case, she has to have further testing performed to discover the cause.\n\nDiagnosis is based on a number of factors, including a genetic test of the fetus, at least one googler-diagnostic test, or internal review with a geneticist. When more than one test comes back negative, the report gives more information about the cause.\n\nWhat it does not do\n\nThe test does not measure how well the mother's body absorbs medication she's taking. However, there is a risk that the hormone prolactin may also be an issue.\n\nWhat information will my health care provider give me\n\nThe information provided about your MSAFP case will include the following information:\n\nWhat state (or states) did the maternal test were performed?\n\nWhy was the test done?\n\nWas the test performed at home, a hospital, in the field, or by a physician?\n\nWhat did the results show?\n\nIs the test negative or does the baby have MSAFP?\n\nHow did the test result get posted?\n\nWhat evidence or medical documents do you have that would support your statement?\n\nMany reports come from people who visit the offices of the researchers. However, the participants themselves are often the most independent source of information. The researchers will also ask you questions, to help you better understand your situation. There can be confusion and delay from not knowing many details about how to handle your case.\n\nIf I think that a baby is at increased risk of having a heart defect, other high risk factors, or other complications during pregnancy, how will I tell my health care provider?\n\nMost medical providers start working on a patient's individual case. If the response from your doctor is supportive (i.e., if the doctor is familiar with the case, and is able to provide any necessary treatment), then your health care provider will move forward with the treatment plan. There is no guarantee, however, that everything is going to be OK for your baby during pregnancy.

This is not a diagnostic test. It is often part of the triple screen test that assesses whether further diagnostic testing may be needed.\n\nWhat is a screening test?\n\nIt is very important to remember what a screening test is before getting one performed. This will help alleviate some of the anxiety that can accompany test results.\n\nScreening tests do not look only at results from the blood test. They compare a number of different factors (including age, ethnicity, results from blood tests, etc\u2026) and then estimate what a person's chances are of having an abnormality.\n\nThese tests DO NOT diagnose a problem; they only signal that further testing should be done.\n\nHow is the MSAFP performed?\n\nBlood is drawn from veins in the mother's arm and sent off to a laboratory for analysis. Results are usually returned between one and two weeks.\n\nWhen is MSAFP performed?\n\nMSAFP may be performed between the 14th and 22nd weeks of pregnancy, however it seems to be most accurate during the 16th to 18th week. Your levels of AFP vary during pregnancy so accurate pregnancy dating is imperative for more reliable screening results.\n\nAll pregnant women should be offered the MSAFP screening, but it is especially recommended for:\n\nWomen who have a family history of birth defects\n\nWomen who are 35 years or older\n\nWomen who used possible harmful medications or drugs during pregnancy\n\nWomen who have diabetes\n\nWhat does the MSAFP test look for?\n\nAlpha- fetoprotein(AFP) is found in both fetal serum and also amniotic fluid.\n\nThis protein is produced early in gestation by the fetal yolk sac and then later in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. The true function of AFP is unknown.\n\nWe do know that this protein's level increases and decreases during certain weeks of pregnancy which is why accurate pregnancy dating is crucial.\n\nThe AFP test is measuring high and low levels of alpha-fetoprotein. The results are combined with the mother's age and ethnicity in order to assess probabilities of potential genetic disorders.\n\nHigh levels of AFP may suggest the developing baby has a neural tube defect such as spina bifida or anencephaly.\n\nHigh levels of AFP may also suggest defects with the esophagus or a failure of your baby's abdomen to close.However, the most common reason for elevated AFP levels is inaccurate dating of the pregnancy.\n\nLow levels of AFP and abnormal levels of hCG and estriol may indicate the developing baby has Trisomy 21( Down syndrome), Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome) or another type of chromosome abnormality.\n\nAbnormal levels may also be a result of the following:\n\nA multiples pregnancy\n\nPregnancies that are more or less advanced than thought\n\nWhat do MSAFP results mean?\n\nIt is important to remember that the AFP is a screening test and not a diagnostic test. This test only notes that a mother is at risk of carrying a baby with a potential disorder.\n\nThere are approximately 25 to 50 abnormal test AFP results for every 1,000 pregnancies tested.\n\nOf these abnormal results, only 1 in 16 to 1 in 33 will actually have a baby that has been affected with a neural tube defect or other condition.\n\n75% to 90% of babies with neural tube defects are discovered through AFP screening. Click To Tweet\n\nAbnormal test results warrant additional testing for making a diagnosis.\n\nA more conservative approach involves performing a second MSAFP or complete triple screen test followed by a high definition ultrasound.\n\nIf the testing still maintains abnormal results, a more invasive procedure such as amniocentesis may be performed.\n\nInvasive procedures should be discussed thoroughly with your healthcare provider. It is also important to talk through further testing with you partner. Additional counseling and discussions with a counselor, social worker or minister may prove helpful.\n\nWhat are the risks and side effects of MSAFP to the mother or baby?\n\nExcept for the discomfort of drawing blood, there are no risks or side effects associated with the MSAFP.\n\nWhat about further testing?\n\nMSAFP is a routine test that is not an invasive procedure and poses no known risks to the mother or baby.

(Image: Public Domain)\n\nOn a wood-paneled wall in the Communications Gallery of London's Great Hall is the photographs of King Louis XV. Their lavish portraits \u2013 which are stacked neatly in a jumble atop one another \u2013 were painted by the country's leading portrait painters, Raphael and Caravaggio.\n\nFour years after his execution in 1670, Charles ordered the removal of the portraits to places that he could not go, including New York and Paris, to avoid contaminating his subjects. The restoration of the portraits, begun by Louis XV's youngest son, Louis VII, took place in the King's childhood home, which he bought in Paris in 1687 and named La Hogue (later Le Hogue, by the French).\n\nThe sculpted words carved on them proclaim, \"Dearest Charles, some men love her with a look, others with words.\"\n\nThese words were painted onto each one of the king's fourteen-year-old portraits.\n\nBecause the French artist Raphael and the Italian poster artist Caravaggio worked at night, they worked differently. Each of the French artists had to present a work of art, with just a pair of eyelashes, to Charles XIV in the Grand Theatre. Raphael had to produce four paintings from one small painting. Caravaggio had to produce five.\n\nThe two artists followed a parallel career path \u2013 they began by being artists at the homes of aristocrats who believed they were closer to God than kings. He painted and made pieces, sold them, and earned a wage as a teacher while also becoming a man who inspired desire, even romance and admiration within the city's elite. His work, something like a wardrobe of emotion.\n\nWhat makes Raphael's work today so significant is the character of its author: he has the classical artistic temperament, that someone who needed to display his work when he left the royal household. He appears not simply as a painter, but also as an ideal, a self-made man of the quality of an artist of the Renaissance \u2013 that is, a man who moved through art, life, and thought not only to create, but to say what he saw with an undivided presence, the creation of symbols, ideas.\n\nWe can learn about Raphael's life as well as his work \u2013 his short story, Antidote, called, for example, for its affinity with Raphael's depictions of artistic rebirth (see below), made its first appearance in the 1620s.\n\nAnd now, with this exchange, Louis XIV appears. You can see it in print. and you can see it in audio\u2026and in this podcast.\n\nRead the full excerpt below:\n\nHappy Birthday Charles XIV. In return for a national banquet of cruelty, frugality, and haughtiness, you gifted the state with the night of mourning. You had hardly ten hours, or even thirty years, before an aesthete decided that rather than putting on something despicable and indecent, he could portray true beauty, as a silent, heroic martyr. You can see him on the terrace. You can hear the patter of the horses' hoofs as they galloped to and fro.\n\nWhy look at him? What are you looking at? Just as the scholars who came with you wondered, \"Was an exquisite chap really so decorous?\" they decided to find out more; they were drawn to the man in the patterns of his garments and the radiant face of his jaw. They were enlightened.\n\nPhilip Tytler, at the time secretary to the king's chamberlain, promptly arranged for the two artists to see each other. Raphael had been commissioned by his Italian patron Caravaggio to do the king, and a production of St. Francis' prayer in the choir room of the Grand Theatre, his first major commission after his coronation, was to be executed on the following August. On the morning of August 17, he accompanied Caravaggio on a journey along the roads in the North, making paintings from the figures to set the scene, in the square of the Reims Cathedral. With one last look at Louis's head, he returned and was not surprised to find it much improved, better and more graceful than his former execution.\n\nRaphael returned for another flight through the bleak skies of Reims Cathedral. Philip Tytler could wait no longer. He called on him again. Overcome with great gratitude, Raphael asked if he would sell his prints that he had shown in St. Francis' prayer. For the sake of him and the country of France, he was ready to make good his promise. He agreed to spend twenty-six thousand livres on the work.\n\nThis sum was 100,000 francs of the king's money \u2013 a fortune in those years. Over time he was to give his possessions to the nation, and the works would make their way to public", "topp": "A portrait gallery at Windsor Castle, royal residence of Charles II.

Taylor had been a regular wicketkeeper, but changed her role to head umpire. To ensure she was able to play at different pitches during the game, a number of other umpires were used, including the reverend George Howard, the former English chaplain to the King, who had also held the post of Dean and the first Anglican to take the post of a vicar.

(Image: Public Domain)\n\nOn a wood-paneled wall in the Communications Gallery of London's Hampton Court Palace hang 10 portraits in a line. All are of women, and all the women look remarkably similar: frizzy-haired, goggle-eyed, double-chinned, and swathed in great gathered folds of silk. These are the Windsor Beauties\u2014the 17th century equivalent of the Maxim Hot 100.\n\nThe Windsor Beauties were chosen to be immortalized because they were the most alluring and powerful women at the court of Charles II, who became king of England, Ireland, and Scotland in 1660. Being selected for a Windsor Beauty portrait meant becoming a celebrity pin-up; copies of the portraits and engraved prints of the women circulated among admirers. Baptist May, Keeper of the Privy Purse and \"court pimp,\" in the words of Samuel Pepys, kept a stash of eight portraits in his private lodgings. Half of the women among those eight were royal mistresses.\n\nAnd really, at that time, who wasn't carrying on with Charles II. The king's reign, which came after more than a decade of Puritan-fueled political upheaval, was so characterized by hedonism and licentiousness that he earned the name \"the Merry Monarch.\"\n\nCharles II, the party-hearty king, in a coronation portrait by John Michael Wright. (Image: Public Domain)\n\nAttractive women were a necessary part of the king's party ethos, and he wasn't about to let a little thing called marriage get in the way of pursuing them ardently. Charles II kept multiple mistresses and fathered at least a dozen children, none of whom were born to his wife, Catherine of Braganza.\n\nWomen held unprecedented power during the Restoration era\u2014as long as they were attractive and down for a sexual relationship with a monarch. (\"Female beauty in England seems to have commenced its reign about the same time as that of Charles II,\" wrote George Steinman in 1871.) For women of the court, physical attractiveness was \"an instrument of ambition, a conduit to pleasure and a magnet for sleaze.\"\n\nBeauty meant being noticed by Charles II, which could lead to mistress status and its associated party invitations, financial security, and a free apartment conveniently located near the king's bed chamber. If a mistress gave birth to one of Charles II's children, the king was inclined to recognize the child as a noble, which boosted the social status of the woman. Charles II also bestowed duchess titles on his favored mistresses as a reward for bearing his children and being general good sports about the whole arrangement.\n\nEven the most attractive court women, however, had to be smoothed out a little when depicted in paintings. During the 1660s, chief court artist Peter Lely painted three-quarter-length portraits of the 10 court women who would go on to be known as the Windsor Beauties. Looking at the line-up, though, it's hard to tell one from the other. Lely idealized the women's features, applying the 17th-century equivalent of photoshop to ensure they all conformed to the prevailing beauty standards. In addition to having near-identical features\u2014and that signature I'm-sleepy-but-sexy-and-also-judging-you facial expression\u2014the women were shown in similar poses and d\u00e9colletage-baring outfits.\n\nThese two Windsor Beauties portraits, for example, do not depict the same woman:\n\nMary Bagot, Countess of Falmouth and Dorset.

The most notorious and well-known Beauty, Barbara Villiers\u2014variously described as a \"beautiful shrew,\" a \"lady of a thousand charms,\" the \"all-powerful queen of love,\" and \"the female Don Juan\"\u2014attracted a special kind of attention. Granted, Villiers, who bore at least five of Charles II's children, was unafraid of scandal and forthright about pursuing money and sex\u2014from Charles II and others.

{"eta": "In the race to move energy off Canada's West Coast, David Black hasn't garnered much attention. The soft-spoken newspaper magnate is, after all, an outsider, both to the $1-billion Petro-Canada company and the province's big oilpatch. He launched his own energy-related company a couple of years ago, as have some of the other leading candidates hoping to ride the wave of prime Minister Justin Trudeau's beheading of political fundraising by lobbyists and the cozy relationship between industry and government officials.\n\nWhat hasn't landed on a more than two-minute web video, though, is the champion of off-shore oil drilling, Bill Thomas. Thomas, who has invested in a $4.1-billion project off the Northwest Coast to process crude oil by gasification, isn't running for Mr. Thomas's seat, but rather to keep his old job as the chairman of Western Canada Natural Resources Ltd., whose shares saw their value soar as oilsands development exploded.\n\nHe was riding high too, while campaigning in the Okanagan in July. It was a wet, sunny day with all of the candidate's campaign resources corralled in a barn behind a holding pen. He was on the western front-line of a fiery campaign that was sold as the end of Liberal C\u00e9line Hervieux-Payette as leader and the beginning of an Era of \"Ensuring the Long-Term Financial Stability of the British Columbia Economy.\"\n\nThe bold rhetoric can seem even more nonsense on a dark, deep Vancouver morning.\n\n\"Oil is a cronyist industry, part of the system,\" the smallish, elder-looking Mr. Thomas said Thursday in an interview, pausing to take a few deep breaths before continuing on, his voice rising. He shrugs off the notion that the oilpatch represents the energy sector as a whole. \"I'm here in that sector just for the energy sector,\" he says.\n\nI know a lot of people are listening and maybe are waking up to the fact that (oil and gas) has become a very interesting topic in terms of policy discussion in this province, and our political leaders are at least recognizing that,\" says Mr. Thomas, who has been chairman of the Ontario Independent Oil and Gas Association for 15 years and was once the regional manager for Pacific NorthWest LNG Ltd., a consortium of energy companies that was recently a key proponent in the bid for a new export terminal on the James Bay coast.\n\nMost of the other candidates acknowledge a role in Mr. Thomas's recent rise, but refuse to speak on the record with a reporter. Some, like Mr. Hervieux-Payette, have been aghast at the 29-year-old's claim, but not all feel the same way.\n\nRachael Holcroft, who lost her seat in the region to the Liberals, was surprised to hear Mr. Thomas complain about government corruption. She suspects they did.\n\n\"On the oilpatch you can't find any people that are being nasty. It's a mob scene,\" she says.\n\nStill, at least Mr. Thomas does not claim a crack at Christy Clark, the current environment minister, either.\n\n\"He's in some respects more compliant than those who are politicians. They're not working people,\" she says. \"They're definitely a little bit more brooding and a little bit more, you know, left of centre.\"\n\nMore recently, Ms. Holcroft made headlines with a profanity-laced tirade in an interview with The Tyee over pipeline construction. And recently, she could not resist taking some jabs at Ms. Hervieux-Payette, too.\n\n\"I just think she doesn't have a grasp on the situation that we face,\" she says. \"I just think she was born with that fact that the fracking [thing] had happened and I mean just getting into politics is challenging.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Black's trip to his relative secure home, in the lower mainland, should be interesting in hindsight, the only other big news so far on the campaign trail was that the B.C. NDP scored a dramatic upset during the 2015 vote.\n\n\"A heck of an upset campaign they got in BC,\" said Allan Levitt, the head of the British Columbia Centre for Policy Alternatives. \"I mean, they got 55 per cent of the first preferences in the last election. They're going into second last for the first time, not a single Liberal seat won there. That says something.\"\n\nOf course, a good reputation on the West Coast helps keep the candidates on the campaign trail, too. Just like Mr. Thomas doesn't think that the coast should be considered a \"high crime and punishment zone\" for oil-related crime.\n\nAnd it seems a good argument that the coast's political discussion might be too hot to handle, and the euphoria around Mr. Thomas may be premature.\n\n", "topp": "In the race to move energy off Canada's West Coast, David Black hasn't garnered much attention.

But for Nanticoke Mayor Dave MacIntyre, Black's political potential is a striking contrast to MacIntyre's own existence. He's the son of a flood victim and a Labour Party activist who spent the better part of three decades as a Liberal public servant. 'The poor little Steve'\n\nDavid Black attends Canada Day celebrations at Centennial Park in Summerside Heights, Nanticoke, Ont., on July 1, 2014. Toronto city council is poised to award black, federal government workers living on the East Coast up to $10,000 a month in rent \u2014 tax write-off for union workers \u2014 as an apparent reward for saving their communities during last winter's summer storm. Andrew Francis Wallace/THE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nDavid Black, provincial pensioner with national standing, lives off his pocketbook.\n\nNot, quite, exactly; Mr. Black is, after all, a self-employed federally registered lobbyist for the unitary organization that represents the outstanding pension benefits for Canada's 27 federally regulated unions (Pennock Occupational Ins. Env. and etc.).\n\nOne could, of course, argue that the guy isn't even his state's official representative. And yet, the picture offered by his website shows Black and his partner living a life of luxury. Using photos and simple titles, it claims that, \"Steve had an exclusive date on a $500,000 yacht and a full-on yacht yard in the Caribbean; two luxurious homes, including a tropical winery and a cashmere farm; $6 million of cash in 10 principal accounts; a homemade ($6,500 a month) 'Raglan' suit and side-car; $500,000 in cash; and some $25,000 worth of tinted windows and custom painted interior walls.\" In other words, he owns two homes, a winery, a cashmere farm and a fancy yacht, with possibly \u2014 though it should be noted \u2014 neither of those possessions listed as assets.\n\nWhite interior\n\nMr. Black's anecdote also reminds us that he has some associations with local people \u2014 a new house and a farm get better mileage than very old houses, no doubt. Mr. Black is, however, the first of the three representatives of the federal government workers themselves who have gathered in this Riderville suburb for a fee to discuss some of the claims of some of them, after getting bail from their union union. Nanticoke Mayor Dave MacIntyre, who, among other things, built the $29.4-million (Dollars in millions) test airport and is in a fight with his union over the issue, co-authored an agreement stating: \"In the event of a dispute between me and the feds, the same FANSGRANDCANADIANS personnel, who remain present in their communities, will always come to the aid of the locals.\" How a deal like that is possible is anyone's guess.\n\nMeanwhile, before letting us end this matter in the most provocatively-dubbed, the cutie-pie arriving in the looks-pretty-Shakespearean style, the very public has given the negotiating agent enough time to address current grievances.\n\nFor the first time on record, union representatives in Nanticoke, Ont., who live off their pocket money, are sitting down and speaking with the local government about their past woes and the present \u2014 they're, to be blunt, facing their future. For years, these folks, years before they saw the club-goer comeback of fifties comedy, Ontario government offices and black saloons from a generation that will be hard to find among their successors in the coming decades, have worried about terms of their collective bargaining. And, they say, the new suggestions for simple stuff, like \"Come here whenever you are ready to talk and we'll solve things,\" can have a corrosive effect on their own negotiations. \"Do you think the feds will sign a 12-year contract with a unilateral mandate, going on six years now and not go back and renegotiate?\" says Johanne Parrondin, an electrical-contractual support worker and fiscal co-ordinator in the union unitary office that represents the unwashed of Nanticoke. \"It's a joke.

We haven't signed it yet,\" the founder of Victoria-based Black Press Ltd. said Wednesday. \"It is a memorandum of understanding that is fairly broad, and we'll be negotiating the details down the road, which is typically the way these things are done.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the oil patch, the refinery plan has been met with skepticism, given that Mr. Black's experience lies in newspapers, not the complex and enormously expensive world of refining crude. Industry analysts have expressed doubts about his ability to sign firm contracts for fuel sales. They say it could be tough to persuade Canadian oil companies to sell their product in British Columbia, which could curb their ability to secure high prices in the competitive Asian marketplace.\n\nOn Wednesday, in a breakfast speech before the Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Black sought to quiet some doubters.\n\nFor the past several months, he has worked with Oppenheimer Investments Group, a Swiss firm that has financed airports around the world and a new city in the Middle East.\n\n\"When we put a project together, we don't do the traditional funding and walk away,\" said Richard Cooke, Oppenheimer's senior managing director for the Americas and Africa. \"We are there from start to finish. So we will be working with David from the permitting to the building to the final end, when the refinery is producing.\"\n\nUnveiled last August at a cost of $13-billion, the Kitimat project is now expected to cost $25-billion: $16-billion for the refinery, $6-billion for an oil pipeline, $2-billion for a natural gas pipeline and $1-billion for supertankers.\n\nOppenheimer has never done anything on that scale.\n\n\"Our specialty is in $1-billion to $3-billion projects. We have done projects over $10-billion,\" Mr. Cooke said in an e-mail.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut, he told the Vancouver audience, initial deals are in place to cover the entire cost. \"We have arranged and we have the funding committed to do this whole project,\" he said.\n\nThe Kitimat project is the single-largest private investment ever envisioned in British Columbia.\n\nMr. Black envisions a 550,000-barrel-a-day diluted bitumen refinery that would transform oil sands product into fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. If built, it will bring with it 3,000 operational and 6,000 construction jobs, and a way to have B.C. profit from oil moving across its territory.\n\nMr. Black has also argued for its environmental merits, saying greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which he is hoping to cut in half using new technology \u2013 will be produced whether oil is refined in Canada or China.\n\nCoastal waters, he says, will be easier to clean up in case of an accident with refined fuels. And he says there is an economic case to be made for a B.C. refinery, which can use cheaper parts manufactured in Asia and secure access to cheaper oil from Alberta.\n\nThe latter calculation may, however, prove difficult. Canada's energy industry has sought Pacific exports largely because it wants higher Pacific prices.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat could make it difficult for Mr. Black to secure Alberta oil \u2013 and analysts say it may be dangerous to build a project on the assumption that North American oil will stay cheap for decades to come.\n\n\"You're not going to see these $40 discounts like you are today.

Since then, the 3D worlds of Disney live action have led to an army of films and media adaptations, including television programs like the early version of The Lion King.\n\nWith such a long line of hits and varied popularity, one would think the franchise would be happy with what it's producing these days, but as of late, the king of N64 games is stuck in third place in the franchise's rankings. To begin at a near-current video game release, Dark Cloud II: Return To The World Of Darkness is one of the biggest and fastest-selling games of any era, and despite the 2D graphics with a slightly shaky framerate, the 3D World Of Darkness experience is on par with any other 2D GameCube experience.\n\nWhat's more, fans were disappointed that Square Enix took their time releasing the game, clashing on a release schedule with Nintendo. So, let's look back to the launch of Kingdom Hearts: Chain Of Memories in 2001, right after the NES' launch. Due to the fact that the game was only set to be released for the GameCube at that time and after Sony pulled the plug on the Playstation in the US right before the Super Nintendo's release (something we covered in depth a while ago), this release was a huge disappointment for folks who wanted to play The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening on the Dreamcast. It wasn't until Link's Awakening came out a decade later that Square Enix learned to cut out the unnecessary, forced clockwork.\n\nAfter a brand new game comes out, developers of a hit title have to put in some time to polish it and fix the big issues that crop up. It can be a frustrating task, especially when developers decide to release a game on less than a year's previous game's schedule. Square Enix decided to head down this path after their demo of the game for the Dreamcast had problems, and instead of rushing and releasing it a year early, they decided to make it right.\n\nThe team spent a whopping two years perfecting the game's visuals and toning down the graphics to keep up with the standards set in other 3D titles. In addition, they enhanced the HD in-game menus to make them larger and have an overall improved system-based interface. The theme for the game is not necessarily the collapse of time, but the general feeling of slow travel through dark realms.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the game is that in recent years, gamers have started to see another special world that connects many classic 3D games.\n\nSoul Reaver is widely considered the first of these games to be born out of the 3D series of games. In fact, it has been owned by a dedicated group of fans for over a decade. This realm serves as the classic version for the Kingdom Hearts series. From here, players are able to follow the story of Sora who has since graduated from Kingdom Hearts II into the new game's series. While it's impossible to go through Soul Reaver without seeing a collection of scenes by major Disney artists, this final scene would make anyone give up on the entire series.\n\nWith the popularity of World of Warcraft so dominant, that number of loyal fans seems like it might be hard to keep up. But the sheer amount of Kingdom Hearts games that are still being made, with so many coming out now that are tied into the franchise, the fans will definitely keep up with the group growing. And if you really want to see a large transition into the new 3D era that Square Enix has started to make, you can always check out this game. But even if you don't, it is an impressive example of the kinds of games that would now be possible.\n\nIt's impossible to deny that a group of fans would make an attempt at a 3D reimaging of the original Kingdom Hearts game.\n\nThat said, there are several issues with this approach.\n\nIn the new game, the Kingdom Hearts concepts are still holding on to their legacy, meaning we could see a familiar face, but in a completely updated way.\n\nThe big-name artists who were hired after the original game (Sayaka Hanako who did art for Kingdom Hearts II and to a lesser extent, the game worlds themselves) all have their own major contributions to make. In case you want to see and experience what they could do, just read on.\n\nAfter a 30+ year existence, the designs of a lot of familiar characters don't seem the same.\n\nDuring the first time Kingdom Hearts was released back in 1996, everyone came away feeling like they had a great time, including a lack of different worlds and characters. To be fair, it might just be the way that the story is written in the original game and new game. After all, we", "topp": "Darkness hearts heart of darkness\n\nKingdom Hearts has had a rough but eventful history.\n\nIt debuted in 2002 and took the world by storm with its genius mash-up of E4 lightheartedness with the most obscure elements of 16-bit platforming - charming pop music, drill-heavy mechanics, and stalwart design. Since this was a production by a team known for its minimalism, Kingdom Hearts never got new content, and through 2010 this video game was almost absent. After a year of well-received re-releases, which included 'heart of darkness', followed by an HD re-release of the original title in 2015, it all came to an end. Only a demo for the eighth Kingdom Hearts, which captured a strange crowd, remained on the 3DS eShop. It is, however, indeed here now.\n\n\"I cannot believe I'm about to show you something like this. Before this, I've been buried with darkness, and the main reason is because the god I love, my father, has really come out of nowhere,\" begins the dialog of world boss Maleficent, which, when paired with it's final theme, Ascension, the whole world feels like the most redemptive and euphoric occasion imaginable. If that was as inescapable and improbable as the idea of a remixed Kingdom Hearts has been, fans will have to face the bizzaro danger it presents when its creators find time to actually build the game.\n\nKingdom Hearts 2.5 ReMIX\n\nNot so long ago, a single disc was universally considered the minimum recommended for a video game because it ran over 100MB of memory. In games where the game would require the player to scan a spare disc to play (many did), remastered games could make last-minute saves and send out an update via Twitter, albeit as a complete hiccup. No longer. The number one YouTube destination for remastered music for shooters and supercomputers is now all royalty free! Ever since these long-lost Kingdom Hearts music should have appeared on the Wii Store, it has packed out, weirdly, a miniature disc within its DVD sleeve. Now in all its source, royalty-free glory, it's beyond the reach of most people - and digital goods specialist, as well as a source of constant envy for anyone worried about piracy and liability - and there's even a bundle for Nintendo 3DS purchasers.\n\nI've heard more than my fair share of complaints about what has become video game disc architecture in the videogame music market. Four tracks of fully remixed remixes of original Kingdom Hearts music has sat in the free form bitmap format on Youtube for years; not done right, but necessary to the dream for a copy of Kingdom Hearts to work on all types of media and processors. Once free means many people will carry their favourite tracks from their computers into their games, as well as those with never been enjoyed in the original. While I prefer to hear music blasting through my Mac, I can't deny that, for the first time ever, Kingdom Hearts 3.5 ReMIX isn't rubbish. It's holding up incredibly well in YouTube's cache and the lossless quality is much better than their more mediocre challenge discs. And, more than anything else, it's great that Kingdom Hearts 3.5 ReMIX gets the Kingdom Hearts fans remixed, having seen their wish come true with the music as well as the game.\n\nThe words \"take one\" roll across the bottom of this lesson. While a pop song got sampled in music CD of the Final Fantasy VIII engine, I fear it's music is yet to rival this. Only some of the artists who wrote the songs for Kingdom Hearts 3.5 ReMIX were notified of their recordings being used in the game; Artyom, Yuji Himukai, Kairi, NekoFuzion, and Honnoji are new faces to appear, yet some previously unreleased tracks have seen the light of day with these first big messes. In my initial excitement I didn't buy Kingdom Hearts III at the launch, so I missed out on a charming mix of Aonuma and Majima's theme that would have occupied the opening area of the game. Japan doesn't understand Hello Kitty; nowadays, when an entire station has a Pikachu animal, you feel a little bad for beating five copies of Onrush to get the hook, and all-concealing like this would have been considered extremely alluring.\n\nI'm not one to jump on the bandwagon; except in certain senses, it was true; Kingdom Hearts 3.5 ReMIX isn't the best music in the world, but it's cleanly extracted from the main body of music, with no unnecessary repetition, rather slow and addictive. I can't look away from the occasional audio or visual glitch; it's far more varied and entertaining than what I was expecting.

To fuel the fire there was a portable sequel to hold people over until the sequel three years later, a very respectable wait by today's standards, but then the series sort of went off the rails. Spinoffs upon spinoffs, mobile titles (for feature phones in Japan!), and 10 years later -- there's still no sign of Kingdom Hearts III.\n\nWell, there's a new Kingdom Hearts game...compilation...thing right around the corner, and it's still not Kingdom Hearts III.\n\nKingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue (PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2017\n\nMSRP: $59.99\n\nBirth by Sleep \u2013 A Fragmentary Passage is clearly the main event. It's the all-new continuation of the story that's been on hold since 2012, and deals with Aqua, one of the main protagonists of the series. It picks up after Kingdom Hearts 3D in an effort to rescue Birth By Sleep's Ventus, Terra, and Aqua from the darkness, where they've been stuck for a decade. For those of you who are looking for some sort of continuation from the storyline that's essentially been on hiatus for four years, you aren't going to get everything you want here.\n\nIf a remix of \"Simple and Clean\" and a tease of the engine is all you need, you'll be more than satisfied. This is mostly for existing fans, no doubt about it. Birth By Sleep is so monumentally important to the story as a whole and single-handedly unshrouds all of its lore, and playing Fragmentary Passage is a great way to get a recap of all that. If you're so inclined, there's an in-game text recap that takes a full-minute to scroll through. The actual game is a sorta-kinda demo, clocking in at several hours for the main story, but there's tons of challenges, several modes, and some secrets to behold if that's your thing, which should extend your playtime a bit.\n\nAll of it takes place in a fragmented Cinderella world of sorts, which looks fantastic. The beautiful artwork for the illustrated level intros is still present, and the new engine (that's essentially a tease for Kingdom Hearts III) is incredibly detailed. The updated tech has made it possible to showcase more realistic particle effects, water, and details like gravel and cobblestone, but it still looks cartoony and maintains that whimsical colorful style -- a true testament of the skills of the design team.\n\nAs an action game it builds upon the strong foundation of Dream Drop Distance. It once again features a perfect difficulty curve, where easy is remedial, normal is challenging enough, and hard is actually tough. You'll start off at level 50 with key end-game abilities in a true continuation, so you won't feel like the game is hamstringing you and you'll get down to business with all your flashy powers right away.\n\nAqua is a beast, and sports a double-jump, continuous air dash, a swift striking speed, magic (fire, ice, lightning, and healing), and contextual abilities like the ranged \"Shotlock\" (returning from Birth by Sleep, which is a little bit faster here), and trance-like Devil Triggers if you constantly attack an enemy and build up a meter. You can block counter immediately after a parry, and Aqua's nimble style and magic-centric repertoire make for a perfect demo.\n\nFragmentary Passage makes you work for it too, with several hard-hitting bosses and a good balance between exploration and light puzzle solving thrown in with all that combat. Sometimes it does involve a \"do this five times\" or \"collect this object to pass\" shtick, which is an intrinsic gate, but it's never dull -- especially when you're earning angel wings and cat ears to dress up with along the way.\n\nAgain, it is a brief affair, but a few old-school extras kept me going back several times after the credits rolled. I got addicted to all of the challenges and wardrobe unlocks, and you can skip cutscenes if you want, even on the first playthrough. Having a save with clear data will unlock an EXP toggle for hardcore runs, and New Game+ is locked and loaded. This is a series that's always put a large emphasis on multiple playthroughs, and as brief as it is, I'd easily play one for each member of the Birth trio as a taster before Kingdom Hearts III drops.

{"eta": "In Brazil, sugar is king. In the field, on the table, on the road \u2013 and in the laboratory. The world's largest sugar producer has been fermenting sugar from sugar cane since ancient times. Its intricate network of sugarcane fields covers nearly a fifth of the world's land area, but still yields 80 billion tonnes of sugar annually.\n\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that Brazil is poised to be the world's third-largest producer of sugar; its leading industry is the industry of making honey, the world's most important agricultural product.\n\nCosta Rica, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Bolivia are all demanding that sugar be recycled as fertilizer in order to curb deforestation in these countries.\n\nIt is true that recycling sugar will have little effect on deforestation, which is due largely to poor economic policies. A $10 increase in sugar prices is unlikely to make much change with worldwide demand.\n\nYet making honey is a considerably more local (and therefore more sustainable) process. And unlike Brazil, where sugar is a key commodity, honey is produced on a sustainable scale on nearly every continent. (I'm looking at you, Kenya and Tanzania!) But sustainable honey production does come at a cost.\n\nWith a world population of 7.3 billion, the world's farmers are facing huge problems; overpopulated land and inadequate water and the disease cycle have created a big strain on ecosystems and human health.\n\nThese problems are combined with rapid climate change and ever-rising agricultural production. Scientists warn that by 2050, the water tables in Central America and the Caribbean will have been so depleted that 50% of the Central American rivers may run dry. And global demand will rise, threatening agricultural production worldwide.\n\nCurrently, the world's sugar harvest goes directly to a growing number of consumers \u2013 mainly in the United States. This dependency on the sugar industry is costly in terms of human, labour, and environmental costs. While the global production of honey far exceeds that of sugar, at $200 billion a year, it's also the largest consumer (largely due to honey's rising popularity). As a consequence, consumers are often unfamiliar with the environmental and health impacts associated with raising honey.\n\nA paradigm shift is needed to bring sustainable production and health practices to honey production.\n\nIt would be an act of justice to recycle all that sugar we have grown on - and replaced with a sustainable crop of hay, quinoa and other African, Asian or Pacific plants.\n\nOur region contains large, highly productive lands; food insecurity, coupled with low income levels, mean that more people are living from hand to mouth. That's a recipe for serious health problems.\n\nWith more people living on less land, the sugar industry is therefore producing sugar that is not necessarily compatible with the natural ecosystems of the local ecosystem. And without returning the use of sugar to its original, natural state, we risk catastrophic consequences.\n\nInterestingly, most honey producers don't see their responsibility in sustainable honey production as reducing the use of sugar. Rather, they see it as preserving the ecosystems that have sprung up around this particular plant.\n\nIn fact, some argue that healthy farming systems, such as sustainable growing and equitable irrigation, are not only better than conventional agriculture, they would make a massive contribution to slowing global warming. More importantly, they are, apparently, the safest way to grow honey as part of a balanced ecosystem. That's perhaps why many ecologists argue that any policy and practice in the context of a healthy ecosystem is preferable to any other single activity.\n\nHoney is the base of the nutrition diet of about 40% of all people in the world. For those who consume a lot of honey, the amount of waste (labeled \"organic\"), packaging and trucking waste the world produces each year makes honey one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. That makes it of greater, and safer, concern as a global problem.\n\nBy providing an opportunity to draw attention to the bigger issues arising at the edges of honey production, it will in turn be a catalyst for change: while large-scale human industrial agriculture increasingly eats up land, displacing natural ecosystems, farming systems with rational alternatives to such industrial systems would improve nutrition and food security.\n\nHealth and nutrition comes from biodiversity, not sugar. So, while we should not add to the ever-growing list of problematic chemical fertiliser and pesticides, we can make a positive contribution to further increasing the reliability and conservation of honey and other vital plants. When you feel motivated to act, and a business opportunity presents itself, join us. We have a plan.\n\nThank you for reading\n\nThis post was inspired by a discussion on the twitter feed about possible solutions to sustainable sugar supply in a more sustainable way ( http://twitter.com/betterherbandfossil) (I'm looking at you, Mozambique!)\n\nBut it's not all negative! In fact, I was motivated by a discussion of how sugar with the correct amount", "topp": "In Brazil, sugar is king. In the field, on the table, on the road \u2013 and in the laboratory. The world's largest sugar producer has been fermenting sugar for 3 billion years, forever evolving and taking flight from the depths of space.\n\nSugar has never been more popular in the United States, as befits an adult beverage loved by all the city's citizens, and also to be enjoyed down the street and in restaurants across the country. The American consumer prefers sugar, even on a sugar-rich diet, when it's readily available, and sugar taxes have been around for over 100 years, just as the price of diamonds has only started to make headway in the world market. Sugar has been a recurring entertainment favorite ever since the beginning of recorded history.\n\nBut everyone knows this. Even trying to list everything that matches sugar's fabled qualities \u2013 its stable acids, its beneficial globulins and almost certainly its guilt-free, no-calorie, sit-on-top-of-someone-crying-girlyness \u2013 can't answer many of the questions about sugar. One interesting paradox is that sugar doesn't have lots of sugar; it only has a small number of isotopes that change with ice. When added to water, it ends up being more like liquor, containing those little crystals that look a little like E.T. (a little radianium, think of all the glorious nuclear energy\u2026)\n\nIt has been estimated that Earth provides just under 2,000 metric tons of sugar per person in a typical day, and annually sugar prices have been soaring across the globe, by around 50 percent. But it's much cheaper to buy, use, heat and ship a ton of sugar. This, it has been revealed, is one reason sugar production is growing by leaps and bounds, just as industrialization makes it easier to grow transportation fuels.\n\nSo\u2026real estate.\n\nWhy is sugar so relevant?\n\nSupply and demand. So, I suppose, the question that's most interesting. My day job is at US Sugar, which is by far the biggest producer of sugar in the US \u2013 more than 15 million metric tons. A bit over a third of this is made up of sodium. But we've got heavy machinery and a high pay in a climate that's baked into industry.\n\nProduction actually began in 1884 and lasted until 1965 \u2013 it was the quickest refining process in the world and the quickest industrial conversion. So you have machines that can cut and grind sugar at its purest state.\n\nAre you keen?\n\nIf you're any way familiar with the workings of a refinery \u2013 and even if you aren't \u2013 the changeover from raw cane to ready-to-use at US Sugar had only seemed to be a modest part of our existence. (Apart from insane overtime shifts, of course.) But in recent years, have the changes in technology, if any, changed what we get from the stuff?\n\nEach step in refining cane leaves behind sediment, a sediment that's largely free of bacteria, and sugar is left behind; nothing even resembling the things left behind when fuel was refined from crude oil. Very slowly, the sugar gets collected from the crown of the sugar cane, and now compared to all those bits of compacted material sitting in our driveways and bike boxes, it's all but gone.\n\nThus people started shipping much of the processed sugar off to Europe where the process was simplified, cutting the processing costs down to almost nothing. Of course, no one would have blamed the whole statement of fact if it was, say, Germany with its abundant storks\u2026. but such is social activity. The market is the process of buying and selling, after all.\n\nStill, it seems that most of the waste is actually providing a source of energy. During the heating and cooling stages, a lot of the cane gets baked. So from the process' line, you're about to do something that involves both heat and some pretty friggin' fluid. About 16 percent of the waste is made from fluid boilers (which have to be powered up when sugar gets low) to make up 75 percent of the finished product (in one of the friendlier countries I know). One of these rigid structures sits on top of my stove, and I often have no choice but to turn it on \u2013 just to get food heating\u2026\n\nAroma.\n\nSugar, you hear me. Sugar is like anything that we mix in our environment. Unless there's a sick allergy, you can cook with it. It seems to have a powerful effect on our sensory system. But it's not just that: it smells good \u2013 not in a good way. It doesn't taste quite the same, and a lot of people complain about the sudden gusto (and I'm sure we've all experienced the arm shake) that accompanies eating that final bite. It all adds up. If you have no air conditioning, you're probably not going to like", "human": "In Brazil, sugar is king. In the field, on the table, on the road \u2013 and in the laboratory. The world's largest sugar producer has been fermenting sugar cane juice into ethanol (alcohol) for motor fuel since 1975. For many years, the Brazilian bioethanol programme carried on in virtual isolation from the rest of the world, using fairly low-tech methods. Now, however, Brazil's federal and state governments are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into research aimed at improving all stages of the bioethanol process, from sugar cane biology to engine efficiency. And the process has become big science, as well as big business.\n\nBrazil has a good track record in research in many areas of science and technology, but \"bioenergy is the field in which we have most to contribute to the world,\" says Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz, scientific director of Fapesp, the S\u00e3o Paulo state research foundation.\n\nAlthough the development of ethanol has been driven primarily by energy security concerns rather than environmental motives, Brazil is now emphasising the fuel's green credentials. Net emissions of carbon dioxide from a car running on sugar ethanol are just 20 per cent of those from a petrol-fuelled car.\n\n\"Until about 2007 the world considered bioethanol to be our weird, tropical idea, and left us to get on with it,\" says de Brito Cruz. \"The game changed when George W Bush made biofuels an energy priority, and other countries entered the field. Then, we set up a bioenergy programme, to protect our intellectual property.\"\n\nBrazil produces more than 20bn litres a year of ethanol from sugar, to fuel the country's 13m \"flex\" cars, which can run either on pure alcohol or on petrol (which itself contains about 20 per cent of added ethanol). A Brazilian petrol station often dispenses four fuels: ethanol, petrol, biodiesel and natural gas.\n\nIncreasing demand, combined with poor growing conditions in some sugar cane regions, has led recently to ethanol shortages \u2013 and an embarrassing need to import more than 1bn litres of US alcohol, produced from corn (maize), which is far less environmentally friendly.\n\nWith Brazilian ethanol demand expected to reach 50bn litres a year by 2020, the bioenergy programme aims to achieve a large increase in supply without a corresponding increase in the farmland devoted to sugar cane. Currently, this covers just 0.4 per cent of Brazil's total land area, or 2.9 per cent of the land set aside for crops. In the case of Brazilian ethanol, biofuel does not represent a significant diversion of land and resources from food production. At present, Brazilian farmers average 84 tonnes of cane per hectare per year, according to Glaucia Souza of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, who co-ordinates the Fapesp bioenergy programme. She calculates that the yield could be multiplied more than fourfold, to 380 tonnes per hectare, by improving the crop and its cultivation.\n\nThe task is made more difficult by the complexity of the biology and genetics of sugar cane, a hybrid of two grass species, Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum. Indeed, the genome of sugar cane has not yet been fully decoded, despite intensive research in recent years.\n\nMarie-Anne van Sluys, botany professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, says the problem is not just the size of the sugar cane genome, which has five times more DNA than humans; the genome's \"decaploid\" nature means that every sugar cane plant has the equivalent of 10 different genomes, compared with two in \"diploid\" mammals (one from each parent).\n\nAlthough genetic modification should be possible without knowledge of the entire genome, attempts to create stable GM varieties of sugar cane have so far failed: introduced genes are quickly silenced or shut down by the plant.\n\nEven so, Brazilian scientists are confident that the genetic mysteries of sugar cane will soon be cracked. According to van Sluys, the priorities then will be to make the plants more resistant to drought and pests, and change their physiology to divert as much metabolic energy as possible into making sugar.\n\nIn Brazil, the reign of the cane is just beginning.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nPink areas of deforestation in a satellite image of the rainforest\n\nSpace agency flies in to save the rainforest\n\nWhen people think about space science, they usually imagine researchers looking out into the cosmos.

{"eta": "Police Have the Scary Capability to Track Wherever You're Driving\n\nA building at 55 Broadway, in lower Manhattan, is home to the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center, which is managed by the NYPD. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nLOWER MANHATTAN \u2014 In June, the NYPD announced that the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), the \"security registry\" that the Transportation Security Administration used to check for \"suspicious activity\" among passengers at all U.S. airports since 1988, would be phased out.\n\nMostly, that should have concerned people familiar with the system. But it does not.\n\nIn reality, NSEERS was never intended for this use. Police originally directed millions of people to register for the system and are still using it. The system isn't useful for preventing terrorism at a national level, says Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard, but rather for the narrowing of the pool of potential terrorists who might want to attack. At the moment, for example, a 2015 report by former DHS chief Michael Chertoff described the NSEERS database as a \"potential tool\" in the fight against \"the radical Islamist terrorist threat in the United States.\"\n\n\"You can't use it to sort through all the different individuals who are extremists and determine whether they pose an imminent threat,\" Glaeser says. \"You'd see a whole bunch of false positives.\"\n\nAll that changes at the lower Manhattan security coordination center.\n\nThe facility is tasked with looking at people who live or are visiting up to 50 different places in New York City at any one time. That includes thousands of people who exercise regularly in several neighborhoods, and thousands more who simply walk to and from these places at all hours of the day and night. The walls are pockmarked with bright blue dots \u2014 NSEERS identifiers \u2014 for thousands of locations, like the Lincoln Center and Times Square Crossroads, that comprise upper Manhattan. Cameras can periodically scan a moving target for the presence of something or someone that might be out of the ordinary.\n\nWhy? Some of a federal law known as the Every Lottery Ticket Has an Equalizer law, passed in 2000 to give the government more power to stop terrorists. This program was updated in 2009, under then-Attorney General Eric Holder, who pushed for sweeping changes. That made this project an official DHS program under the new program.\n\nMostly it just began using the NSEERS database when it began identifying potential terrorist threats against the United States in late 2015. There were, in fact, six known major terrorist attacks that month, including the deadly July 5 Paris attacks. Still, there were nearly a hundred people within that \"shoot\" zone, according to NYPD spokesman Paul Browne.\n\nMostly, it just began using the database when it began identifying potential terrorist threats against the United States in late 2015. There were, in fact, six known major terrorist attacks that month, including the deadly July 5 Paris attacks. Still, there were nearly a hundred people within that \"shoot\" zone, according to NYPD spokesman Paul Browne.\n\nHere's what happened next. Soon after the shootings, police announced that NSEERS would be put on a suspension to address the threat, something they had been unable to do since Sept. 11. Public attention about this controversial database developed, which led the city to certify the system for use in local communities and coordinate new steps for registering people to participate in the registry, for example in identifying people in the United States who are carrying weapons or in need of medical care.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the NYPD issued details about NSEERS' suspension, which city officials had previously kept confidential. For a while, people worried that the agency's NSEERS would open other databases on people for a range of things. But then, officials said, the department settled on the idea of preventing terrorism by using this database to patrol and document lower Manhattan at particular times. That means that in about 5 percent of cases, they will consider someone a potential terrorist, the cops said.\n\n\"Using the tool for a sustained period of time is one way for law enforcement to restrict activity in an area and generate risk information to monitor for,\" police spokesman Paul Browne said.\n\nThe NYPD does not release the number of locations where people who are engaged in real or potential terrorism are tracked, but a 2014 paper from John Mueller and Jane Henkin, economists at University College London, estimated that NSEERS will identify 45,000 Americans a year in that way, \"repackaging the nationwide and international flow of suspicious activity reporting and using it to 'pipe down' into a variety of other sources.\"\n\nThe real number might be higher, they added.

Last year, the National Security Agency dropped a colossal building block in the hope of installing listening-post capabilities throughout the city. A panel discussion at the annual conference of the National Press Club brought together the tech industry and government officials as well as privacy advocates on Monday.\n\nThanks to its multiple layers of encryption, the city has become the prime target for spammers, cybercriminals, and terrorist sympathizers.

His 1999 experience in Chicago's Cook County Jail sparked a push to quickly produce DNA evidence to courtrooms across the country to clear men who faced a day in jail because of \"evidence gathered by the police.\" Nearly 20 years later, DNA evidence still struggles to be handled as evidence\u2014and the Chicago police force remains at odds with its own officers on who receives legal assistance.

In 2000, the two co-founded BrainMosaic, working out of Yoshida's lab, using their background in computers to form BrainMosaic, a computer vision startup that later gave birth to TigerMosaic.\n\nTheir hybrid device is an over-the-air patch designed for phones, which streams video to the camera\u2014and then uploads it to remote computer servers. You wouldn't need a remote control to turn on a light, or even have to pull the power cable to turn a light on\u2014and it doesn't require data from any phone.\n\nInstead, a setup in the lab allows the individuals who are using the device to remotely control TigerMosaic's cameras, saying things like \"demo is illegal\" or \"host state raided,\" before shooting the drone in the face. \"There is no need to upload audio or video,\" says Prof. Yoshida. \"These people have these toys at home\u2014not for demonstration,", "human": "Police Have the Scary Capability to Track Wherever You're Driving\n\nA building at 55 Broadway, in lower Manhattan, is home to the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center, the locus of the New York Police Department's massive, intelligence-gathering activities. According to a 2011 estimate, the facility integrates not only some 1,000 NYPD cameras located in lower Manhattan and some 700 cameras in midtown, but an additional 2,000 private surveillance cameras owned by Wall Street firms. These cameras are principally focused on capturing license plate data. The center cost an estimated $150 million to set up.\n\nWhile Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly endlessly tout the value of Manhattan's \"ring of steel,\" modeled after the security infrastructure of London's financial district, they reveal little as to its role tracking car traffic in the city. Both back the department's Domain Awareness System (DAS), which can track individuals or incidents (e.g., a suspicious package) through live video feeds from some 3,000 CCTV cameras, 2,600 radiation substances detectors, check license plate numbers, pull up crime reports and cross-check all information against criminal and terrorist databases.\n\nThe NYPD is but one of a growing number of local and state police agencies throughout the country engaged in the non-stop tracking of car license plates. Most troubling, the data captured through license plate reader (LPR) and automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) programs are being integrated with other personal data to provide the security state with ever more detailed profiles of ordinary Americans.\n\nSPONSORED\n\nMotorola is one of the major tech companies providing police agencies with ALPR products. The Moto system is used to track the \"vehicle of interest\" by a police officer in a squad car. The captured data is integrated into the back-office system software, or BOSS. The system incorporates diverse data sets, including full or partial plate numbers, GPS coordinates, time and day, photographs and more. Equally critical, the system allows data to be shared among multiple locations and agencies.\n\nFederal Signal's PIPS Technology of Knoxville, TN, is probably the largest supplier of ALPR technology. Other suppliers include ELSAG North America of Brewster, NY; MVTRAC of Palatine, IL; and San Francisco-based PoliceOne.\n\nThe federal government is the principal funder of car tracking. According to the FBI, its Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS) approved LPR in June 2004. As of September 2011, \"46 states, the District of Columbia, 33 local agencies, and one federal agency have formal agreements with the FBI to receive the NCIC information for the purpose of using LPRs.\"\n\nThe LPR program is part of the larger National Crime Information Center (NCIC) that \"enables law enforcement and the intelligence communities to identify terrorists, apprehend fugitives, locate missing persons, identify unidentified persons, recover stolen property, and protect innocent persons.\"\n\nAs recently reported by the Wall Street Journal,the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has distributed more than $50 million in federal grants to law-enforcement agencies over the past five years. It noted \"a 2010 study estimates that more than a third of large U.S. police agencies use automated plate-reading systems.\"\n\nState police agencies and local law enforcement authorities throughout the country are actively engaged in license plate tracking. In Washington, DC, some 250 tracking cameras are in operation. According to the ACLU of Washington, 18 police departments in the state have deployed them. In Maryland,some 320 LPRs are in use and scanned license plate data, including even non-criminal information, is collected by the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center. (The Center, while its website has e-mail and phone contacts, provides no address.)\n\nIn New York, the state police reported in 2010 that its auto-theft unit had tracked over 57,000 licenses. The outcome: it located a whopping three stolen cars and 200 revoked or suspended license registrations.\n\nThe Memphis, TN, police have implemented the SkyCop, the Mobile License Plate Recognition & Video Surveillance System (MLPRV). The police champion it as \"a platform to provide mobile, on the fly, license plate reading, video surveillance and analysis.\" The police proclaim the system \"incorporates all of today's advanced technologies to provide on board storage, and remote access for database updates, data offload, and video records retrieval.\"\n\nThe squad car cop now has access to vehicle registration info as well as information about people driving with outstanding warrants, in stolen vehicles, with revoked licenses, stolen plates and stolen renewal licenses.

{"eta": "Combine and Conquer Combining sutureless lamellar keratoplasty, phacoemulsification, and IOL implantation in one surgery allows rapid visual rehabilitation in healthy adults.\n\nSUPPORT AND LACK OF INTRODUCTION\n\nLoss or partial blindsight (SPBS) is a common health outcome in the United States. It affects adults in particular, likely because of blindness-related tasks such as driving and shopping. Studies have indicated that 70% to 80% of patients with SPBS recover some vision with visual rehabilitation therapy (11). But other studies show no visual recovery and a delay of approximately 10 to 15 years and even longer with surgery (13, 14). Thus, patients in a long-term care facility may not recover vision, unless accompanied by adequate visual rehabilitation. In addition, many patients with SPBS are severe visual handicaps. Significant delays of surgery have limited the usefulness of IOLs in preventing amputation of the portion of the brain responsible for visual processing. Nevertheless, the fact that IOLs can correct visual deficits in patients with minor lesions of the retina without inducing loss of conscious control makes them useful in treating such patients. To our knowledge, there is no review of IOLs for the treatment of adult-acquired blindsight.\n\nVulnicollis is a reversible disability that may progress to IOL after surgery to correct the pathological changes of the retina (15). An initial assessment using T2D visual cortical sensitivity has shown that the retinal microcircuits that underlie the development of lesions are highly susceptible to imbalances in the neuronal concentrations in visual pathways (16). Therefore, it is sensible to avoid IOLs in patients with normal photoreceptor functioning who are at risk for recurrence of pulpositional optic neuropathy (PON).\n\nWhat is the basis for weaning from IOLs to attempt the rehabilitation of patients with severe spasticity in late adulthood with relatively mild spasticity? Considerable progress has been made, yet in spite of the progress, weaning from IOL has been a difficult option. Numerous studies indicate that IOLs are feasible in the adult setting (Fig. 1) and that the patient need not be minimally neurologic, IOL-proof, or age-progressive and have very good control of some sensory functions such as hearing, smell, and touch; to achieve minimal visual function, patients must have a combined therapy strategy of SPBS and other sensory modalities and must have a compact vision correction system. Improvements in sensory parameters improve functional outcomes in this population (3, 16) and if permissive IOLs are operated, patients with very poor visual recovery and nerve conduction abnormalities can achieve an increased functional score on a sensory-predominant functional rating scale on visual analog scale (16). Another animal model has demonstrated that early bilateral IOLs produced by a magnetic field and imaged by ultrasound can rapidly improve sensory function (17).\n\nFig. 1. View largeDownload slide An analogy for the rationale for early IOLs. A rather young patient with severe SPBS was treated by irradiation of the peripheral retina. This radiation removed approximately 90 nm of surrounding lipid and induced a healthy, sensitive retina with a short myopia, a minimal swelling of the eyelids in both eyes, and normal hyperintense nystagmus at 80 mm of retina (adjusted visual acuity from 20/60 mm to 20/20 s). At 16 years, there are no obvious signs of retinal lesions, normal sensitivity to light, or abnormal hypersensitivity to sound such as is present in the patients with extreme spasticity. After early IOLs, the patient is no longer dependent on vision in everyday life and is able to complete tasks that involved vision such as driving.\n\nFig. 1.

Patients should be cared for with consciousness support until their ability to live independently is independent of their vision. Patients whose vision is adequate before IOLs are performed should be followed up to evaluate their visual rehabilitation and long-term satisfaction.\n\nC.

Often, we come across patients with central but superficial opacities, and concomitant cataract, who do not warrant a full thickness keratoplasty. One option for these patients is a combined surgery, with a lamellar graft and phacoemulsification. However, conventional lamellar keratoplasty has its own problems, such as suture-related astigmatism and infections, and can be unpredictable.\n\nBut there is a way to bypass the problem of sutures \u2013 using a biological glue to stick the graft to the host cornea. The results we have witnessed so far of sutureless lamellar keratoplasty, performed as a standalone procedure for the management of corneal opacities, have been encouraging (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Sutureless anterior lamellar keratoplasty for the management of corneal opacity has returned promising results.

This approach enables rapid visual rehabilitation after a single combined surgery (rather than a staged procedure). The residual stromal bed is thick and smooth \u2013 which means performing phacoemulsification is less surgically challenging.\n\nIn terms of technique, sutureless corneal transplantation can best be described as replacing the 'free LASIK cap', with the cap being taken from a donor cornea.\n\nWe performed this triple procedure (lamellar keratoplasty, phacoemulsification and IOL implant) in seven eyes of six patients with anterior stromal corneal opacity. All the procedures were carried out under peribulbar anesthesia, and a Moria microkeratome and artificial chamber (ALK System, Moria) with a 200 \u00b5m microkeratome head. For trephination of the host cornea, a suction ring (number 0) was placed over the host cornea, and the same microkeratome head (200 \u00b5m) was used to trephine the recipient bed. Phacoemulsification was completed through a 2.7 mm superior incision, and the donor lenticule was then placed on the host bed and any residual fluid from the groove at the graft-host junction was absorbed using merocel sponges. One drop of slow component (thrombin 4) fibrin sealant (Tisseel, Baxter Healthcare) was evenly spread along the edges of the donor cornea, into the groove. No adhesive was applied over the stromal bed. The glue was allowed to act for a period of three minutes, and following this, any excess coagulated glue was removed using the sponge wick. A bandage contact lens was then placed over the cornea and retained for a period of three weeks.\n\n\"We have found this surgery to be easily repeatable, with consistent results, and we believe that the fast visual rehabilitation it offers will result in its widespread adoption in the future.\"\n\nBetter together?\n\nThe results were promising.

{"eta": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\nThis invention relates to bus architectures and particularly to low latency shared bus architectures.\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\nThere exist a large number of bus architectures, which have been developed to support a wide range of high-volume and low-latency applications including telecommunications, speech, smart phones, consumer electronics, and the like. These bus architectures are often written in C/C++ or the assembly language which is ubiquitous for computer programs. There are two widely used bus architectures with different history and usage but that have been proven effective for carrying a great deal of the capacity of a given platform. The first is an asynchronous bus architecture which has been around for years and has been marketed by a number of companies to support high-speed communications with mobile devices. The second is a shared-memory bus architecture, which has been around for several years and is marketed by Intel to store video memory data within a single memory cache. To date, the size of the shared-memory bus was substantially larger, yet this architecture could significantly reduce throughput. Each of these systems has its limitations however.\n\nThe advantages of a low-latency shared-bus architecture exist from the fact that each subsystem (e.g. key-pulse or baudrate, lock, etc.) is small, dense, and highly compartmentalized when compared to a low-latency non-shared-memory bus architecture. This architecture is available as a light-weight platform (i.e., a PCI device but not a normal PCI system bus interface) and thus can be used for both communication purposes and memory capacity utilization. While this application is not a specifically chosen context, the underlying architecture is suitable for a host of subsystems and thus is a good foundation for a low-latency shared-memory bus architecture. It was previously proposed that a shared memory system will share the same architecture as the individual bus components, but that this cannot be the case for shared-bus architectures, because each bus component is unique and so each bus component must share an architecture as well. This would be an application of the Reentrant Set (RS) problem. On a Reentrant Set problems (hereafter referred to as the \"RS\" problem) are a type of memory bandwidth compression. In a conventional bus architecture, there is an element of memory on the bus that is responsive to input, or interrupts and that is a typically fixed-size memory that is used for input to the bus network. If it cannot be used for input, the the bus network should be broken into regions of differing size which communicate only on known bus frequency or bit-rate. If there is a fixed size bus that is appropriate for the logical layer of a system then this could be obtained by dividing the bus network into separate logical layers. Although it is claimed that most systems do need a Reentrant Set (RS) problem, the system discussed here is more efficient than that.\n\nThe Reentrant Set problem (RS) arises between two sets of inputs of different sizes and degree of response. The proper application of the problem lies in determining if the response of each input set is the same regardless of size, performance, or latency as they are similarly responsive. For example, if the latency of a network may differ only a few microseconds, where one and the same key response comes from the same bus components and whether or not they respond on the same bus frequency. Depending on the application, the amount of space an RSB in the large table/tables may need to be divisible into the smaller partitions on the bus while also providing sufficient contiguous storage space for the large buffer and getting rid of all of the small sections of the original table (i.e. making a single linked list or a single sorted list). If a system for memory is able to solve this problem, it would have a solution to any variety of RS problems. The maximum storage capacity that is available would be up to the total block size of the memory bus or 4096 bytes (i.e. 3 billion bytes) per bus module. Because that is the maximum available capacity, the maximum size of all information a system can tolerate may be about 6TB in size, or about 9.2 TRILLION bytes, to be exact.\n\nDue to the nature of the problem, it requires a particular configuration of the memory bus and the system to be able to make it work. Currently, the best solution for a non-low latency platform is using a module based design that can store images, and possibly sound, and thus use an integrated connection, thus being unable to use an external RAM buffer without \"speeding it up\" or being unable to support high-speed communication without having external memory for \"running\" data in the first place. The PCI bus is not good enough in this respect because it does not form a bottleneck to the RSB. The modules may try to use the same common RAM size for both small and large partitions. When using", "topp": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\nThis invention relates to bus architectures and particularly to low latency shared bus architectures.\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\nIn the architectures discussed above, multiple shared storage channels are used. Each channel has a unique identifier, specifying the volume of storage it will hold, its bandwidth, channel capacity, latency (in ms), the replication mechanism, and preferably a 4:4:4 subbuffer spacing (a 4:4:4 BSS with a BSS dimension of 2:2:2:2). Each storage channel also is a memory bus, in which each memory reads and writes data from its memory address points to its respective memory location, optionally using a \"store\" and \"load\" cycle.\n\nOther features of the architectures discussed above include: (a) output buses, (b) global memory services, (c) uptime features, (d) job queue management and quorum, and (e) hardware resource scheduler.\n\nMore generally, each storage device includes memory elements that are used to store previously acquired binary data or a sequence of data. In addition, each storage device may also include memory elements that are used to store binary-only data, and includes a page table to store of page control data and a storage master memory to store a data master. A host machine may then use a storage resource to provide an SCSI or DAS unit, AHCI, PCIe, PCI and I2C bus interface between that storage element and the input and output elements of the storage device in a single bus interface.\n\nAnother common feature of memory controllers is a global cache. Rather than storing binary data locally, the cache maintains data of the previous state of a stored value over time and returns to the application when previously referenced data is no longer active.\n\nAnother key feature is single master execution control for the storage element. A single master may be a master of one or more hubs or a \"central master\". The master may provide a cache, bitmap, sorted file, file located in a remote location, a locked device, one of the number of pages and the like, as well as a unique identifier for a single storage element.\n\nAnother aspect is the simultaneous access of a number of storage elements. If a system executes multiple low-latency memory accesses, each memory access requires a global backup routine. When this backup routine returns, the system may directly read from the backup page cache for the same input data and read from a copy of the backup data for the new or updated input data. This process may be exponential or need exponential I/O rates. When the backup routine has completed, then all accesses that are in memory of any given storage element are read without any need to copy data between RAM and disk. Also, typically since multiple storage elements are in memory at one time, free memory can be readily available to avoid limiting the number of storage elements that may be used at a time.\n\nA particular use of shared memory is in accessing the legacy kernel of a computer program when the program is signed or encrypted. The sign code was never designed to be shared, but whether or not they can be shared is another topic altogether. Additionally, file accesses may potentially use shared memory not just for system operations and software updates, but also local files by only having to read the contents from their respective storage locations.\n\nIn a user service oriented storage architecture, a host system decides if an interface is capable of supporting a particular functionality and directs the implementation accordingly. The host system can provide access to storage elements for others to use as well as support the operation and capabilities of the user. The host system also may allow the host to update the signature of a binary stream and decide to store the data to another location.\n\nAdditional features include a static ring of protected/under-written random access memory (RASM) areas. This RASM can be used to provide cryptographic functions that utilize the secure data. In addition, there can be one or more systems with authorized access to the services and content.\n\nIn an alternative type of storage architecture, a management module refers to a machine that manages resources and configured for operation in accordance with service requirements.\n\nAn additional system might contain a version control system that maintains the output of one branch and the version of a specific output file.\n\nA particularly advantageous system design could use a LSRM plus \"plug and play\" architecture, wherein each computer installation consists of a software preinstalled system (one or more programs) on the installed computer platform. A preinstalled program either provides certain features as needed or it is seeded with random data. The preinstalled program is generally partitioned into small software packages, such as a user interface to the preinstalled program or a small file.

Field of the Invention\n\nThis invention relates to bus architectures and particularly to low latency shared bus architectures.\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\nA bus is a communication path between various devices of an electronic system. For example in a computer system, the central processing unit (CPU) communicates with main memory through a memory bus. Peripheral devices may also be connected to the memory bus or connected to the CPU through a separate IO bus.\n\nBuses can be divided into two general categories: point-to-point buses and shared buses. A point-to-point bus connects only two bus devices together. A shared bus can be used by more than two bus devices. Thus the number of buses required for communication depends on whether point-to-point or shared buses are used. For example, four bus devices require six point-to-point buses to communicate with each other, but four bus devices can communicate through a single shared bus. With a shared bus architecture all four bus devices can share a single bus.\n\nPoint-to-point buses have the advantage of lower latency, minimal bus contention, and the ability to support multiple simultaneous data transfers. However, the large number of buses used in a point-to-point bus architecture requires a large amount of chip or board area.\n\nSince only a single shared bus can support multiple bus devices, the chip or board area required to implement a shared bus architecture is much less than is required by a point-to-point bus architecture. The primary disadvantage of the shared bus is that arbitration must be performed so that the bus devices can efficiently share the shared bus. Furthermore, device identification is necessary on the bus so that a bus device only receives or responds to signals directed towards that bus device.\n\nWith the increasing complexity of electronic systems, data buses have increased in width. The wide data buses preclude the use of many point-to-point buses when chip or board area is costly. Therefore, shared buses are commonly used in complex electronic systems.\n\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of a conventional shared bus system 100. Bus device 120, bus device 130, bus device 140, as well as other possible bus devices (not shown) are coupled together by a shared bus 190, which contains an address bus 150, a data bus 160, and a control bus 170. On some shared bus systems, the address values and data values are multiplexed on a single combined address/data bus. Each bus device has a bus request output terminal R, a bus grant input terminal G, address terminals ADDR, data terminals DATA, and control terminals CTRL. The bus request output terminals and bus grant input terminals are coupled to a bus arbiter 110. If bus device 120 wishes to use shared bus 190, bus device 120 must drive a request active state on bus request output terminal R. The signals, specifically the request, grant, and select signals, in the embodiments and timing diagrams described herein use logic high as the active state and logic low as the inactive state; however, logic low is also commonly used as the active state with logic high being the inactive state. Bus arbiter 110 monitors the bus request signal on a corresponding bus request input terminal. Since arbiter 110 has a bus request input terminal for each bus device, the bus request input terminals are labeled R_x, where x is a number corresponding to each bus device. If shared bus 190 is not in use, bus arbiter 110 drives a grant active state on the grant output terminal coupled to grant input terminal G of bus device 120 to a grant active state. If two devices request the bus simultaneously bus arbiter 110 can use a priority scheme to determine which device receives the bus grant.\n\nThe use of separate bus request and grant lines for each device is commonly referred to as independent requesting arbitration. Other commonly used arbitration schemes include daisy chaining and polling.\n\nA bus device which is granted the use of the bus is commonly referred to as a bus master. The bus master communicates with another bus device, which is commonly referred to as the bus slave. A bus device may be capable of being a master only, a slave only, or both a master and a slave. If bus device 120 is granted the bus, bus device 120 becomes the bus master. Bus device 120 then drives address bus 150 and control bus 170 through address terminals ADDR and control terminals CTRL, respectively, to initiate a data transfer. Specifically, bus device 120 would drive address signals onto address bus 150 through address terminals ADDR and control signals onto control bus 170 through control terminals CTRL. Control bus 170 can contain control signals which indicate, for example, the size of the data transfer and the direction of data transfer (i.e. a read or a write).\n\nTypically each bus device is given a range of addresses for the various data under control by that bus device.

The gig was new, but she already had plenty of experience running a store in a small town. So she looked forward to meeting some of the other new hires and chatting with old colleagues as they finished up their tasks and headed home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThen Vinkemulder asked the director of sales, Jennifer Weinberg, why there were so many people there, and the conversation quickly turned to the exorbitant cost of working for Xerox. The general manager of the store had no idea why its office space had the cheapest monthly rent in the county, and the sales manager could't understand why the principal and assistant principal were expected to pay more for phone lines and refrigerator storage. She concluded that Xerox didn't plan to negotiate on salaries.\n\nVinkemulder pulled aside her supervisor, Ernie Bunton, and started shaking her head. She wasn't happy.\n\n\"So one of my concerns was that I needed the employment environment to be conducive to my philosophy of staying a qualified worker, and that kind of came along with the job,\" she said in an interview at her office in suburban Seattle. \"Without realizing it, I was implicitly taking to heart the corporate mantra that there are no secrets and that those who can't keep a secret should not be allowed to work with all of the things that Xerox could keep hidden.\"\n\nVinkemulder left Xerox last summer after 25 years working in the office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n* * *\n\nSilicon Valley is filled with faith-based leadership, an ethos that comes from the zealotry of radical Christian televangelists. Despite having a secular name that took on particular meaning with the advent of televangelists, such people offer themselves as models of compassionate service.\n\nBut in every great corporate culture that grows in this country, the ethos of faith-based leadership stretches into the core.\n\nFrom PayPal to Facebook to Google, these traditional sectors and their workers have seen radical job cuts, worker surrenders of rights and autonomy, and declines in living standards. Yet these values endure amid a backdrop of austerity-obsessed corporate-governance movements, cultural skepticism about experts and programs, and disdain for nuanced dispute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nCompanies want to shift away from traditional types of public servants from many religions\u2014judges, police officers, and so on\u2014to the CEO. Meanwhile, as Silicon Valley firms move to \"disrupt\" Wall Street in their pursuit of top executives, it has helped prepare employees for resistance to regulatory reforms aimed at preserving markets and workers. This culture of mild skepticism, carried to the world of silicon valley, is one that was shaped by Benjamin Rush, a radical Kentucky land-grant college dropout who found a far-reaching calling in the Methodist Church.\n\nSome modern big companies take this into their heart. Google employs as few as 60 people and is built on a strictly functional, decentralized Web infrastructure. Yet as the company has grown it has abandoned a hard-line free market system of reward and punishment for the vast majority of the company's workforces. Instead, Google pays talented people with a mix of grant money and stock based on hard work and personal decisions.\n\nThis system is admirable from a philosophical point of view. There is no forced hierarchy imposed on rank-and-file employees\u2014there are no whimsical but honest letters of recommendation or emotional blackmail. Instead, those who are directly responsible to the company's bottom line have an opportunity to develop strong personal relationships with top executives. This style of working also generates an illusion of independence, such that the leaders are often capable of boosting and enabling less-firmly held employees.\n\nGoogle has taken away autonomy and reward from many of its workers.\n\nBut this philosophy has also created a culture of workplace dependence. According to a recent report by Unite Here, the largest unionized tech company in the country, \"almost every staff person\"\u2014including managers, engineers, designers, and even scientists, engineers, and scientists\u2014is dependent on Google \"to get by.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\"It's no accident that a business that is so open about its structure would have a culture that encourages employees to depend on colleagues as their only support network,\" said Erwin Chemerinsky, a labor economist who has served as director of the Labor Department's Office of Technology Policy since 1996. \"You have to have social support if you're going to grow large enough to face the challenges of delivering ideas.\"\n\nWhat makes this situation so damaging is that the more any worker is dependent on a boss, the higher risk they face of quitting (companies with a high ratio of part-time workers have higher unemployment rates than those with few part-time workers). In turn, dependence increases risk aversion. After all, if", "topp": "Photo illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker.

There were no walls or partitions or locking mechanisms, and she usually had to enter the dark. But the company required most employees to wear these safety helmets when in line, and Vinkemulder wouldn't take them off if she had to do something heavy.\n\nNow, she takes off her helmet. Almost immediately, she says, she gets a tattoo of a grinning-for-the-helmet head.\n\n\"I'm into the adrenaline rush,\" she says. \"I love it.\"\n\nBut you can also get the \"crushed coffee taste\" of your brain slipping into a haze from using your head too much, Vinkemulder adds. If you work just five or six hours at a given job, these little discomfort things can be a headache. They happen \"like a bridge collapse,\" she says.\n\nHealth and safety, in this office-centric modern world, is also a business imperative.\n\nAnd Jim White, the Xerox marketing director responsible for corporate safety, explains that eyeglasses and other sunglasses are a basic, affordable protection against neck injuries. \"A lot of people who work in the hazardous environment wear them,\" he says, \"and some do [and] some do not.\"\n\nHe cites-for example-that in 2012, Xerox reported 5,364 health and safety incidents, that's a record for the company. But you'll never hear him mention the number of those injuries that were eyeglasses-related.\n\nIn addition to headwear, the perils of wrapping your head in a thermal liner during a busy meeting are well documented. Rather than rejecting this scenario outright, White acknowledges it could make someone more likely to throw up. \"All right, sir, go back to where you came from,\" he says with a hand on the gurney.\n\nThe project and product notes required to survive a paper board encounter were equal parts challenging and fun. \"The body is a good, wonderful machine,\" White says, likening the task of sorting and writing out a series of scribbles while facedown in the hot seat to walking an open field, balancing on your hands and elbows.\n\nMore than a dozen of the nearly 2,000 gauges had to be replaced at Xerox under investigation for reason of failure, including one that stopped working weeks earlier after Foxconn had installed an electronic cable in the back.\n\nCharlie Paynter, a Xerox safety engineer who's now a consultant for the company and the USSPA, points out that shipping PVC pipes to China is inherently hazardous, \"but it's really all we can do to mitigate that risk to our customers in the hardware industry.\"\n\nIt's the whole linen jacket situation that raises a red flag for the Safety Research and Training Group, an organization that specializes in passenger safety, particularly the type of chest-impact-related injuries experienced in airplane crashes. The safety room at Airbus Group's Halle Airport covers about 250 square feet, and is as much an exhibit hall as a bulletproof garage.\n\n\"Most aircraft carriers actually have nice clean rooms in which the entire workers' protection program comes into play,\" says Danny Brown, manager of safety education and research at the group.\n\nBlack balloons, thick and black in color, represent vital life support equipment. Credit: Amy Orthology/Thinkstock.\n\nEach jacket has a visor liner that protects the back of the head; an airbag that performs the power of a seatbelt; and a vent system so that the pressure inside the jacket rises from the bottom to the top of the body like a funnel and shatters the airbag's rubber seals inside the shoulder openings. You can check these out if you want to make sure the force of your crash didn't reduce the life-support systems' function enough to spill body fluids or force them to explode prematurely.\n\nIn a cockpit crash at Boston's Logan International Airport, an array of automatic protective devices fails; in 2009 a brief washer and dryer left a hole in a cockpit at Newark Liberty International Airport.

After a series of fast food and restaurant jobs marked by unpredictable hours, her new one seemed to offer a haven: 40 hours a week she could count on.\n\nBut it took almost no time for the promise to be broken. She discovered those 40 hours could be sliced and diced any way her managers wanted. She'd work nights from 2 p.m.\u201310 p.m. and mornings from 4 a.m. to noon, often with just a day's notice. She'd be asked to work two four-hour shifts split by three unpaid hours. She would go in on holidays and snow days. She'd be threatened with firing for any complaints.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nAs a result, Megan's personal life went haywire. Her chaotic schedule strained her relationship with her boyfriend, forcing her to constantly cancel plans, and eventually they decided to call it quits. Because she needed to work every holiday, she couldn't see her family for a year. Job hunting wasn't an option\u2014most job interviews were scheduled in the middle of her shifts.\n\nThen she met an organizer from the Oregon Working Families Party who was working on a campaign to make hours more predictable and stable. Megan, who had never been involved in activism before, initially hesitated, worried about blowback from her boss.\n\nBut after connecting with others like her, Megan went all in. Soon she was knocking on doors, speaking publicly about her ordeal, and even traveling to the Oregon House of Representatives to give testimony.\n\nOregon passed the country's first statewide fair workweek law in August. The law ultimately guarantees that working people at major retail, food, and hospitality companies get a heads-up about their schedules at least two weeks in advance, overtime pay for hours worked with less than 10 hours of rest between shifts, and the right to request a flexible work schedule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nIt echoes laws in other cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, and Emeryville, a retail hub in the Bay Area. In San Jose, California, voters last fall passed the first-ever fair workweek ballot measure, voting overwhelmingly to give part-time workers the opportunity to work enough hours for a reliable paycheck by forcing businesses to offer more hours to part-time workers before hiring new workers. These laws make it easier for working people to balance work and family and predict their hours from week to week, ensuring they can better plan their budget and their time.\n\nThis movement for a fair workweek has emerged in response to the rapid expansion of low-wage service jobs over the past few decades. As many chains turned to workforce management technologies to squeeze more out of workers, hours for the growing service workforce became increasingly unpredictable. Big brands started to use \"on-call\" scheduling that required employees to be available around-the-clock. The recession accelerated these trends as employers turned many full-time jobs into part-time ones.\n\nEven when the economy bounced back, the recession had made its mark, leaving millions of jobs that require workers to constantly scramble for hours with no guarantee they'd add up to cover basic costs.\n\nWorking Washington\n\nIn response, workers began to organize to win back a say in their workweek. In Seattle, for example, the movement was led by Starbucks baristas like Darrion Sjoquist. Sjoquist's mother worked as a Starbucks shift supervisor when he was in high school, coming home late at night and leaving before the sun was up. When his mom was called to work unexpectedly, Darrion picked up caretaking duties for his niece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nYears later, when Darrion became a Starbucks barista himself, he saw little had changed at the company and stepped up to organize alongside his co-workers to call on Starbucks to provide a fair work week. He led his co-workers in a letter-writing campaign to then-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and even questioned Schultz at the Starbucks 2016 Shareholders Meeting about whether he supported fair working hours. Driven by thousands of baristas speaking out from Seattle to New York City to Los Angeles to Atlanta, Starbucks adopted 2 weeks advance notice and guaranteed 8 hours of rest between shifts. Seattle City Council unanimously passed its Secure Scheduling policy later that year, ensuring more reliable hours for Starbucks workers as well as many others throughout the city. Nationally, baristas continue to call attention to how lean staffing undermines these gains and makes it hard to have a stable income and even call out sick.\n\nWorkers like Sjoquist and Vinkemulder are changing the conversation on the concept of flexibility as a whole to include the conditions of the low-wage service sector.

{"eta": "In the instances where caching is being provided, the SharedCacheMap member of the _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS structure is an opaque pointer to the SHARED_CACHE structure that also has a SHARED_CACHE_POINTERS pointer (to which the cached module's actual cache object mapping points). Therefore in a write access to a shared object, the _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS structure is not subject to garbage collection, so it can be kept around even though it is no longer valid or even most likely, not readable. In case the module is deleted by the garbage collector, the shared cache is restored and the refcount remains.\n\n[Editor's note: You might remember on the very first Java HotSpot\u2122 of 2010 that the C/M is smart enough to properly handle the context manager getting garbage collected. Since then, however, we've witnessed that the exact opposite is true in this case. Why is that, and can we extend the error handling to reflect that? From a caching perspective, in case of a shared object crash, is there any way to tell the context manager to keep the cached data for another thread (even if it would be very hard)? Or does the context manager simply say \"well, that works for me, you're just alone in the room and not responsible for the underlying hardware's performance (or write-sequential access to the heap), so forget about it\"?]\n\n3. So, what's the point of the _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS structure?\n\nThe _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS structure is a pointer to the shared object cache, which takes up one page of the _TEXT structure. When both user-defined and static classes are stored in this structure, a typical (under the surface) aspect of a caching module is probably to be able to provide context managers to locate cache objects.\n\nThe _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS structure also points to the cache object mapping module, which provides this data to the user-defined (or static) classes. You'll notice that it returns true. If you think on the filesystem the algorithm is the same as it is on JVM, with a fixed first few bytes, the _TEXT structure looks like this (here one layout variant is shown):\n\nstatic __stack64 int _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS( _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS* __map, _TEXT* _p_value, _SECTION_BIT_CHECK size) { size &= ~size; if (__map->_i_size == size) return true; _PTR_OFFSET = _p_value->_i_bits + sizeof(_SECTION_OBJECT_PTR_OFFSET); *__map = _p_value; return true; }\n\nThe true array array is 1072 bytes of contiguous, 40-byte pages of page data, and that's in a mutate+update mode.\n\nThe refcount is the number of times that the _TEXT structure points to an object. In typical case of a dynamic class storage architecture (which is probably how this module is implemented), this refcount can have a value in the microseconds region, with a maximum of approximately 7 bytes. Since the _TEXT section is 1072 bytes (maybe 1064 bytes, which is why this benchmark is still under benchmarking), that should seem to be enough. However, that does not exactly work. In particular, the heap is bigger, the two segments have different sizes, a potentially-glitchy BFS might be a bit of a problem. Here is an excerpt from the binomial test:\n\n1 0.8 3.1 29.2\n\nThe lower bound is obviously not counting about how many use cases the caching module actually creates. This benchmark is still very much running within this framework in the sense that the _TEXT structure is getting mapped to different locations on the heap.\n\nOn the other hand the upper bound is quite different from the lower bound. Obviously the cache must be used, but this benchmark test does not actually create anything that calls into the actual data structures.\n\nThe fact that this benchmark test is running under a garbage collector is curious. It's very unusual to get a garbage collector for Java code which does not actually hold and manipulate objects, most commonly storage classes which are found in a context manager stack. On the other hand, when you compare it with the compiled version of the codebase, the user code is not going into any garbage collection zone. The last codebase that actually runs a garbage collected codebase is as an afterthought in a fixed prefix, so it's less likely to have a garbage collection implemented that's a compilation unit.\n\n4.

The argument to compute_stream_invalidate_compute_unread points to a function call to the _DISM_MSVC_FORCE_THREADED_READ_COMPUTE_COMPARATORY function. Its return value is the associated state transition.\n\nPerformance\n\nAlthough subprocess.Popen() did not provide any significant performance benefits over the threading routines used by threads as yet discussed, it has been determined that Popen is somewhat more performant than the threading routines used in the functions described here, including the ones recommended as alternatives. These routines appear to use trivial computing hardware; allocating objects, maintaining references to them, and performing many unneeded modifications to the object in processing events. The dedicated malloc algorithms often performed even worse than those used by Popen, and the garbage collection routines performed worse than those used by the threading routines. Also, the memory access patterns in the multiprocessing routines may not be very compatible with the pattern of on-demand access used by Popen ; they may also introduce CPU-heavy overhead, thereby increasing computation costs and thus significantly decreasing performance. However, using Popen as a benchmark in terms of performance may be somewhat misleading.\n\nThe work done during this work was motivated by requests to demonstrate that it is possible to correctly use C++ or Linux containers to provide a shared cache as a consistent way of reading and writing dynamic memory. These container-related references point to a C++ library function, _SECTION_OBJECT_TABLE. A certain base object table struct is created on each process, and certain base node structs are managed in the pthread namespace. When __pthread_init_handler is called on the pthread_init function, in either the call or at the call site, the function examines the object table structure to determine what the object name and, for each object in the object table, its object class and, for each base node struct, its postfix field name.

While the paper did not detail the algorithms used in the analysis, we remembered, that Ruud had submitted the code for inclusion in Volatility back in 2008. Looking though the code, we noticed that he focused on a subset of PTEs found when traversing the DataSectionObject. Later that year, a team lead by Seyed Mahmood Hejazi also wrote a paper titled, \"Automated Windows Memory File Extraction for Cyber Forensics Investigations\", which also discussed the benefits of extracting memory mapped and cached files. Unfortunately, some discrepancies in their pseudo code and images made it difficult to replicate their research. \u00a0Their analysis of cached files also seemed to be limited to files that were small enough to be found in the InitialVacbs (1 MB). \u00a0 In 2010, Carl Pulley created a Volatility plugin, exportfile, for extracting both memory mapped and cached file artifacts that he used to solve the Honeynet Project Challenge 3. In particular, he demonstrated how PDFs and Firefox artifacts could be extracted from physical memory. This was a major step forward as he was the first to actually release code that others could use and evaluate. Thus, we wanted to see if we could augment Carl's work to support PAE kernels and x64 (Shoutz to Carl!). Finally in 2011, another research team re-implemented Carl's work for a Black Hat presentation titled, \"Physical Memory Forensics for Files and Cache\". The work presented lacked sufficient detail or code to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach. They also demonstrated a clear lack of understanding in a number of their claims. The DumpFiles Plugin The DumpFiles Plugin works by collecting _FILE_OBJECTS from both the handle table and virtual address descriptor tree. Once those objects have been collected, it will proceed to extract all memory mapped and cached regions to a specified output directory. Typical command line usage: $ python vol.py dumpfiles -f <sample> --dump-dir <filesdir> \u00a0-S <summaryfile> --profile=<Profile>\u00a0 This will create a number of extracted file artifacts in the output directory. \u00a0These files are named with the following schema: (file.$PID.[SharedCacheMap.offset|ControlArea.offset].[img|dat|vacb]). The goal of the naming schema is to help provide provenance as to where the data originated. Example output names can be seen below: file.1300.0x8704e540.img file.2648.0x868b58e0.vacb file.436.0x8a06ace8.dat It will also create a detailed summary file describing which pages where actually present and which were paged out and subsequently padded with the output file.", "eta_suffix": " last codebase that actually runs a garbage collected codebase is as an afterthought in a fixed prefix, so it's less likely to have a garbage collection implemented that's a compilation unit.\n\n4.

{"eta": "Abstract Powdered milk products for children (Growing Up Milk Powders or GUMPs) containing added carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose are now well established in parts of South America and Asia. The sugars in GUMPs are absorbed in the digestive tract and excreted unchanged, whereas in the conventional brand-name products (Dulce de Leche or dextrose-containing treats) the sugar is reabsorbed by the body. The mechanism by which GUMPs increase satiety has not yet been elucidated, but is proposed to be through an effect on gastric emptying.[13] Thus, in one study infants given GUMPs after their naps ate less all day and ate significantly less later in the day than infants given D-pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Children who drank GUMPs experienced lower energy intake and food energy density for the next 24 h compared with children given D-phosphate.[14] Thus, GUMPs might be of interest in obese children. A recent study by Cisgott et al. analyzed body composition and appetite related variables in a sample of 24-hour dietary records from children aged 6\u201310 years with an estimated body mass index (BMI) of 30\u201350. In children and adolescents with an obesity in BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2, the difference between boys and girls was 23.5 g; boys consumed the least amount with a variation ranging from 21.4 to 22.3%. On average, the study found girls to consume more high-fat foods compared to boys; however, the rate in the boys was lower, and the difference between the genders was not statistically significant. In the study, the diets were remarkably similar (SI Appendix, Table S8). In conclusion, it appears that high-fat diet improves weight control, while the GUMPs seem to result in a mild satiety-inducing effect with a similar potency to D-pyridoxal phosphate, despite their small amount.\n\n2.3. Short-term evaluation of Gums and Detoxification Treatment of with GUMPs in adults, adolescents, and children with obesity [4] for weight loss is based on the optimal use of GUMPs in humans, and is, therefore, an important treatment strategy for the overweight and obese population. However, the present study described on this topic is based on the current pharmacokinetic data on acute GUMPs in children with overweight/obese subjects. This preliminary study was undertaken to validate the safety and efficacy of a treatment called GUMP therapy for children with overweight/obese patients. In the present study, we showed that the pharmacokinetics in a random sample of 36 children with overweight/obese subjects from 14 different Latin American countries included in our study sample were similar to a substantial portion of children with diabetes mellitus who received a single dose of D-desoxyglucose. The results of this study showed that acute administration of GUMPs for children with overweight/obese adults resulted in similar pharmacokinetics as the administration of D-glucose. Based on the present data (data not shown), we propose a standard practice for the administration of GUMPs in children with overweight/obese adults and evaluate whether any possible adverse effects such as tachypnea, fainting, and cardiac effects also remain low in children with overweight/obese adults regardless of D-glucose or GUMP doses.\n\n2.4. Long-term treatment of overweight/obese patients with GUMPs in healthy elderly patients [5] Clinical experience with GUMP therapy has indicated that the long-term treatment effect of long-term GUMPs are still far away, especially compared to oral forms. For the treatment of overweight/obese adults, and especially obese seniors, we recommend short-term, two to three-week treatment cycles with GUMPs in an adult population.\n\n3. Lessons from current GUMP Therapy Clinical guidelines for the dosing of GUMPs have been published by the International Surgical Congress on Primary Care [14], which suggested administration of one gram every four hours in healthy young adults. In the \"Primary Care guidelines for treatment of overweight/obese adults, second edition\" [15], the guidelines considered the administration of one gram every seven hours in the same age group of adults to be sufficient for the prevention of overweight. A recent meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials, the \"A dose-effect analysis of dietary soft drinks and foods and body weight maintenance\" published by the American Association for Clinical Nutrition, has proposed consumption of one g/day of GUMPs in adult females to be sufficient to reduce body weight.[16] These safety guidelines have been justified based on animal studies proving that GUMP, or the combination of GUMPs together with dextrose, lead to favorable effects during both clinical and in vitro experiments. This has been supported by an extensive weight management", "topp": "Abstract Powdered milk products for children (Growing Up Milk Powders or GUMPs) containing added carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose are now well established in parts of Asia. They are quickly becoming popular among American and British youngsters in both countries. In the mid-1960s, America's \"diet industry\" gave us egg substitutes like Sprinkler Gel, and egg substitutes called \"all purpose\" wafers made of corn or cotton starch; and the low carb Crisco and Pepsi-Cola snack packs looked great. Then came the developed world, and it quickly became evident that rice and soy and potato could be blended well with eggs. Today, of course, all children and adults all over the world enjoy cakes and other baked goods made with low-carbohydrate cream cheese and various low-carbohydrate natural sweets.\n\nThe GUMPs are unquestionably good. They may even be added to a child's meal, provided that they are administered daily. Frequent administration is important. One serving could supply about 60 to 70 grams of carbohydrate. Even then it probably would not be enough to induce hypoglycemia. Many GUMPs are prebiotic; they help the intestine to work better so that starches do not enter. There are high claims that a benefit may be obtained for the entire day, not just at meal times. You can easily make as many as 20 servings a day, with 3 or 4 servings a day along with the GUMPs. However, special care must be exercised lest you cause parents to avoid feeding your child the GUMPs or other products that have these active ingredients.\n\nHealth Benefits of the Low Carbohydrate Diet\n\nGeneral Healthy Nutrient Profile of the Low Carbohydrate Diet When examined in detail, it is obvious that the low-carbohydrate diet is completely nutritionally adequate. In all nutrient analyses published in mainstream medical journals, no relationships between dietary carbohydrate, protein and fiber are observed. In fact, in many studies the actual reduction in carbohydrate and protein during the low-carbohydrate regimen was quite small. These results don't really alarm the public; indeed, the low-carbohydrate diet is commonly recommended for many kids. More importantly, the scientific evidence does not support the claims that it has any medical value.\n\nMany of the RCTs since then have confirmed the nutritional adequacy of the GUMPs. Few of these have been that rigorous. The few that have had evident risks have been in children with known food allergies or intolerances. To be sure, the GUMPs contain artificial sweeteners (or containing such sugars as sucralose and saccharin) but the consumer is not supposed to think of them as such. Further, while they are obviously acceptable as part of the diet for children, those with good digestive health and rare food allergies should not be influenced by the GUMPs as long as they exercise proper taping care in their daily foods. If however it is not an allergy problem, the GUMPs can be used as part of the normal diet without any problems.\n\nGrowth: First You Float In Your Gut\n\nYouth are often not educated about how to produce and express growth. However, the microbially active properties of starches make them exceptionally rich in growth promoting substances called amino acids. Most of the adult world has forgotten that an atopic disorder called \"acidophilus\" can cause premature spots or sore throats in growing children. If an ate of only flour or cereals, these delicate eczema-infected ulcers would be completely gone in only a few weeks, but the developed world has not. It is clear that deficiencies in proteins or vitamins can result in excessive, ill-defined growth.\n\nIn the early 1990s, several groups of scientists, with the active assistance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, did something startling: they imaged the human child's body at only a few days old. No wonder the human heart appears to go out before the head. By the time the child is 3 months old, his body is 2 inches longer than it was at birth. At 5 months he has less than a quarter-inch of body fat. His bones are slightly bigger, despite taking in fewer calories. He develops correspondingly larger and stronger muscles.\n\nThe shocking thing about these microscopic imagings was the realization that we were all part of an incredible evolutionary aberration. According to the increased brain capacity in many animal species, the brain was designed to grow and develop. It became a type of nutrient storage organ just before our own form of life. This is what the young girl in the first GUMPs image and the stubbornly depressed dog in the picture above were doing.\n\nNow many of us are living in a supposedly post-industrial world. As we graduate from a drug-drug society to an atom bomb society, vitamins and oil from cattle feedmills are depleting our world's water resources, replacing precious carbon-based life with increasingly unpleasant, carbon-based food products", "human": "Abstract Powdered milk products for children (Growing Up Milk Powders or GUMPs) containing added carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose are now well established in parts of Asia. We surveyed GUMPs in Malaysia and Indonesia to determine the content of added carbohydrates. The ingredient lists and nutrition information panels were used to calculate the percentage of declared carbohydrates contributed by added carbohydrates and a subset of seven products was tested for their glycemic index (GI) and insulin responses in healthy adults. The glycemic load for each product was calculated. In total, 58 products (n = 24 in Malaysia and n = 34 in Indonesia) were surveyed. Added carbohydrate content (excluding fibre) ranged from 0 to 21.5 g per serve. Milk powders without added sources of carbohydrate had similar GI values to standard liquid whole milk. Products containing maltodextrins, corn or glucose syrups increased the GI by more than 2-fold, and glycemic load (GL) by 7-fold compared to milk powders with no added carbohydrates. Insulin responses were significantly but not strongly correlated with glucose responses (r = 0.32, p < 0.006). Children's milk powders containing higher levels of added carbohydrate ingredients elicit higher glucose and insulin responses than liquid or powdered whole milk. Keywords: milk, carbohydrate, glycemia, insulinemia, glycemic index\n\n1. Introduction Milk and dairy products are staples of children's diets in countries with a long tradition of dairying, and increasingly in countries of Asia where dairying is still largely absent. In western countries, dairy products are recommended as one of the 4\u20135 food groups in official dietary guidelines. Milk contributes high quality protein and significant quantities of micronutrients, including calcium, riboflavin, vitamin A and zinc. More recently milk is being used as a delivery vehicle for other nutrients such as vitamin D and iron. In Asian countries, a new category of high value milk products for children known as Growing Up Milk Powders (GUMPs) has become established in a short timeframe [1]. They are perceived by health professionals and carers as a valuable supplement to children's diets to help ensure they obtain adequate nutrition, particularly if the diet is generally poor. Unfortunately, there is a growing trend for manufacturers to incorporate additional carbohydrates such as sucrose, maltodextrins and corn or glucose syrups. Some of these ingredients may be useful in small amounts to increase palatability and encourage consumption of an otherwise bland food. But many products contain high levels of added carbohydrates without detectable sweetness that dilute the nutritional value of the milk. The additional calories and higher energy density may contribute to the trend of increasing overweight and obesity among children in Asia [2]. Discretionary calories are also more concerning if they have the capacity to stimulate excessive postprandial hyperglycaemia and insulinemia. Postprandial glycaemia has dose-related harmful effects that increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease [3,4,5]. The current research was therefore undertaken to determine the extent to which additional carbohydrates were being incorporated into GUMPs for children in two Asian countries (Malaysia and Indonesia), and to assess the impact of a selection of these products on blood glucose and insulin responses. The glycemic index (GI) and insulin index (II) were determined according to standardised protocols.\n\n2. Experimental Section A total of 58 GUMPs (24 from Malaysia and 34 from Indonesia) were surveyed for total and added carbohydrate content. The ingredient lists and nutrition information panels were used to calculate the percentage of declared carbohydrates coming from added sources of sugars and refined carbohydrate ingredients, excluding dietary fiber ingredients (e.g., inulin). In Indonesia, but not Malaysia, the total carbohydrate declaration on the Nutrition Information Panel generally includes fiber. The carbohydrate, protein and fat content of standard full cream and non-fat milk powder were used for reference [6]. A sub-set of 7 products ( ) was selected to be representative of those available with a range of added carbohydrate contents. They included GUMPs with no added carbohydrates and those with high levels of mono- or disaccharides and/or maltodextrins (i.e., short chain glucose polymers). Equivalent carbohydrate portions (25 g) were tested for their GI according to the International Standards Organisation methodology [7]. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with ethical research in human subjects, and the protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney.

My husband and I recently moved to Millburn NJ. I will be working in NJ while he will work in NYC. We are unsure how NJ and NY state taxes are applied. Does he have to pay state taxes in both states? How does this affect our federal return - do we file jointly or individually? I have heard of \"double tax\" for people living in NJ and working in NY, but can't seem to determine whether it is the truth or a tax myth. Thanks for any light you can shed on this subject. I hope this fits into the criteria of the type of question you will answer. Thanks, Erin A. A good question, Erin. And one that applies to many NJ taxpayers. First, if you must live in New Jersey at least you have chosen a nice, albeit expensive, place to live. I worked for many years in nearby Summit. One suggestion \u2013 go to Route 22 to buy gas for your car. The basic answer is that you will not be \"double-taxed\". You will receive a credit on the NJ return for the state income tax you pay to NY on your husband's wages. However, as with anything involving taxes, it ain't quite that simple. If you live in one state (New Jersey) and work in another (New York) you must first pay state income tax to the state in which you work (New York) on the wages earned in that state. The non-resident state (New York) will not directly (see below) tax you on your other income (i.e. NJ wages and self-employment earnings, interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.). The state where you live (New Jersey) will tax you on all of your taxable income from all sources, including wages earned in another state (New York). Your resident state (New Jersey) will allow you to claim a credit for any non-resident state income tax paid to another state (New York) on income taxed by both states. Your husband will have New York state income tax withheld from his wages. He will probably not have New Jersey state income tax withheld. He will have to file a New York State Form IT-203 \u2013 Nonresident and Part Year Resident Income Tax Return. The way this works is that first you calculate the NY state income tax liability as if you were a full-year NY resident \u2013 reporting all income for the year that is taxable to a NY resident and claiming all deductions for the year allowed for a NY resident. You then divide your New York State Adjusted Gross Income from New York State sources (in this case the wages earned from your husband's employment in NY) by your New York State Adjusted Gross Income from all sources (as if you were a full-year resident) \u2013 and multiply the result by the NY state income tax liability you had initially calculated as if you were a full-year resident. Sound confusing? Here is an example:\nLet us say your federal AGI for 2007 is $150,000 and your husband's W-2 from his New York State based employer indicates $50,000 in NY wages. For simplicity sake you have no federal \"adjustments to income\" and no New York additions (i.e. non-NY municipal interest) or subtractions (i.e. taxable state income tax refunds, interest from US government obligations like Series EE savings bonds, taxable Social Security benefits, and certain retirement income). Your allowable New York State itemized deductions total $24,999 (not the same as your total allowable federal itemized deductions). You do not have any dependents (NY does not allow a \"personal exemption\" deduction for you or your husband \u2013 only for dependents). So your NY taxable income, figured on all of your 2007 income as if you were a full-year resident, is $125,001. You NY tax would be around $7,725. Your NY total AGI is $150,000. Your NY source AGI is $50,000. So your 2007 NY state income tax liability would be $2,575 ($50,000/$150,000 x $7725). On the NJ-1040 resident return you would figure your NJ Gross Income Tax liability on all your 2007 income, from all taxable sources. Let us say this comes out to $4,860. You would then divide your NY source income, say $50,000, by your New Jersey Gross Income, say $150,000, and multiply this by the $4,860. This would give you a credit of $1,620 ($50,000/$150,000 x $4860) for the $2,575 in state income tax paid to NY. So your 2007 NJ Gross Income Tax liability would be $3,240 ($4860 less the $1620 credit). You will note that you paid $2,575 in state tax to New York, but got a credit of only $1,620 on the NJ-1040.

{"eta": "Now that you have become familiar with the common features and two important principles of soothing that are often used in all countries and all cultures, let's consider a number of common soothing techniques, and some advice for where to learn and what to practice.\n\nBefore we move on to discussing some of these techniques and some of the principles and practices that underpin them, it is necessary to offer some warning that, over the years, a number of promising relaxation techniques and practices have become \"pseudo-therapies.\" That is, they were conceived of and spread along entirely false lines, with the effect that some people tried these relaxation techniques and they got stuck or that it was beneficial to try this or that relaxation technique for various reasons and had no foundation in reason. This is especially common in massage, because the former (massage) is not true therapy. To answer that question in its entirety requires a different article to be sent to the reader, however, we will point out a few phenomena that have led (possibly with good intentions) to numerous many bogus practitioners and pseudo-therapies.\n\nPsychology will explore that in its own analysis of the practices, methods and expectations of \"Effective Deliberative Mediation\" (EDM). So for today we will speak only about the relaxation techniques themselves.\n\nSleeping for Relaxation\n\nThe first kind of relaxation technique, and the one that will first be dealt with, is \"Sleeping for Relaxation.\" There are various myths that go with this principle, and this article is not an attempt to debunk all of them but to introduce some better, less mystifying ones as we go along.\n\nIn the twentieth century there was a mentalist movement whose promoters worked to change the way people thought about and practised mental psychology. They hoped, too, that this approach would release them from the rigours of any particular discipline and allow them to receive and channel their natural cognitive energies. This was their intent, anyway. They were keen to use the highly popular method of sleeping for relaxation as the means to this end. They aimed to induce sleep by encouraging people to settle down for long periods of time to rest their minds. So they did this by sending people a ton of fluff and travel magazines that contained statements like, \"I wish I could come here with you. It is amazing, the richness of our world. I am so excited to learn about each little thing. Oh, you loved those Mexican mosquitoes? I am all excited to see them. Oh, you have come up with that beautiful thing about psychic powers?\" They would send these people, as well as with some simple training exercises, onto far-flung places overseas so that they could spend a lot of time inside these magical, mystical, exotic lands, experience these incredible things, feel them, talk about them, and so on.\n\nPeople felt as if they were actually being asked to enjoy themselves on this planet in this way, to really do it for an extended period of time. It is a beautiful idea, so a lot of people practiced it and their own cooperation came to be regarded as an essential ingredient for their success, at least in part. We already know, of course, that doing this does not work.\n\nLately some experts and readers have gone back to what happened to \"The Summer Of Love\" in the 1960s and 1970s when it was suggested that people spend their vacation time listening to short tapes and trying to relax by going to sleep for quite a while. Many were relieved to do so and actually found that it made them feel more alert. However, this experiment is no different from any other variety of therapeutic intervention and the only important difference is that it is all controlled science. In many ways it is as likely to work as any other relaxation technique because it is always a controlled experiment at the \"control\" laboratory as well as the one under the \"treatment\" one. That is, the person in question has to practice sleep for relaxation all the time and, so long as it is successful, the results are guaranteed to repeat themselves. Of course, although it is quite possible that there could be some psychological effect at all in cases where sleep for relaxation was only tried for a few hours each time, we would be very interested in more information about that.\n\nOf course, if you practice Sleep for Relaxation for long periods without any noticeable results you are probably not doing it correctly. If you feel your spirit get too relaxed your mind might be playing tricks on you\u2014thinking you are enjoying a particularly pleasant vacation\u2014and thinking that this is what you are missing if you do not engage in some serious meditation or other relaxation technique immediately after you fall asleep. So you would do well to try to follow some long-term research and experimentation for some time to be sure that there is nothing obvious going on and that your style of sleeping for relaxation is indeed effective and the only reasonable process for inducing sleep for relaxation, regardless of what other people say.\n\nPrompt Relaxation Techniques\n\n", "topp": "Now that you have become familiar with the common features and two important principles of soothing that are often used in all countries and all cultures, let's consider a number of common soothing responses.\n\nConsider some basic \"fundamental\" principles of standard care:\n\nEstablishing an established routine for treatment (four times daily, preferably sleeping between treatments)\n\nEstablishing bedtime (three to four times daily)\n\nEstablishing temperature (avoiding significant increases or decreases from 20 to 50 degrees)\n\nSituation and feasibility of improvement (positive and negative feedback)\n\nUsing sound \u2013 pleasant is the best, considering if this is required, listen to traditional music.\n\nBeing mindful of what is going on around you\n\nEstablishing the next method of therapy \u2013 pharmacologic or/and lifestyle-related ways of cutting off the emotional effects of the situation. Common approaches include the following:\n\nClassification of the trauma: Sudden and profound variations in the nature of the anticipated stress. Contrast between exposures and empathic assessment \u2013 factors associated with a specific situation include what kind of victim, if any, was involved; and whether or not the perpetrator or people directly involved participated in the pain and suffering \u2013 physical, mental, economic or sexual or emotional. This gives us more insight into whether therapeutic progress will be made. For example, mild fatigue and apathy can be put down as being due to a weak sympathetic tone, to a deliberate modification of responding body and mind to such circumstances, and the possibility of rebound.\n\nBiological and behavioral responses \u2013 reducing tolerance of pain, inhibition of movement, switching the victim from one person or object to the other. Physical measures: evaluating skin temperature, breathing, heart rate, nervousness and number of heart beat or biceps pulse or worry.\n\nVerbalisations of the physical process: A general response. \"Today you were upset, and tomorrow I will be upset for you as well.\" Or \"You're lying there on the floor in pain and shame\" etc.\n\nVisualisation of the immediate situation: If the victim has already been laid out \u2013 provide energy for movement, unsteadiness, activities of breathing and analgesia (e.g. stretching, loosening hand or arm muscles). If the person is still in the situation, acts as if he would rather be anywhere but there \u2013 has effortless communication with the activist and gently turns the situation off. If the victim is at the room with the perpetrator, acts as if he has gone somewhere else and has returned to the room where he is unconscious. If the victim is asleep, behaves as though he is sleeping. If the victim is awake, acts as though he has some choice to do something. If the victim is not aware (e.g., not knowing him), act as if he is coming home from work. If the person is awake, acts as though he has taken the bus.\n\nMental and verbalisation of the person's reaction or nature. Effective communication of individual statement, e.g., words and emotions alone is effective. Stopping when not needed. Beware of not knowing the extent of the mental and verbalisation. Also, exaggerations (being more 'tragic' than it was). Focus on the facts, verbalising those without personal involvement, distinguishing'real from 'false' statements. Check statement against reference \u2013 comparing and contrasting with other statements. Example: \"Ah, no wonder I was upset, Mr. X was angry and abusive towards me. It was unfair, unjust and unlawful.\"\n\nEmotional and volitional self-disclosure, increasing feelings of safety and control. Comparison \u2013 identifying changes in signs, aggressiveness and feelings. Example: \"Mr. Y is always yelling at me, constantly hitting me, refusing to leave me alone and locking the door of the room even when I am asleep. He has repeatedly choked me, stripped me naked, strangled me, struck me with scissors\u2026\" Do not err on the side of truth in comparison. Compare with story \u2013 quote from the perpetrator to assess if change has been made. Assess perpetrator's attitude toward anger \u2013 indicative of social networks and suppositions is prejudice. When rape has a history, link it with the victim's childhood experiences \u2013 ie, what was she conditioned to expect about men who are more aggressive towards women than other men (because they committed it against her). Visualisation and directing of thoughts about the culture of abuse is a step forward and a constructive activity. In addition to the above issues, one must also be aware of the two basic responses to some traumatic event (e.g., emotional, cognitive and physiological). Repeated imagery is discouraged, which translates into a constant vigilance on seeing through any 'ghost' or'movie-like' imagery. I suggest taking the initiative to introduce a greater degree of subliminal imagery. Include space by introducing a relation \u2013 if this is used in visualization, stimulus should be an external situation (such as stairs), not the literal content of the imagery itself", "human": "Now that you have become familiar with the common features and two important principles of soothing that are often used in all countries and all cultures, let's consider a number of common soothing methods that parents and caregivers have used to calm their infants.\n\nAs you may imagine, there are hundreds of options. As an example, cultures around the world have developed many methods for carrying their infants. Some of these include different ways of swaddling their infants, some of these include different kinds of baby carriers or slings, and some of these just include carrying your baby around in your arms. When you think about the carrying methods that you or others have used, you will probably notice that your carrying technique incorporates many of the common features of soothing, for example:\n\nCarrying often includes changes of position; Carrying often (but not always) includes looking at your baby and him/her looking at you, increasing eye-to-eye contact as well as human stimulation; Carrying includes many sensations including touches, smells, sights and, if you talk while carrying your baby, sounds; Carrying includes closeness with the baby's mother or parent; If you are walking around with your baby, the walking introduces rhythm into the baby's calming experience.\n\nAnd, of course, the two principles of soothing will be part of it: carrying works some of the time, but it doesn't work all of the time; and carrying is something that you can do all of the time, not just in response to the baby's crying.\n\nCommon soothing methods in the Period of PURPLE Crying.\n\nIn another section of this website, there is a description of the Period of PURPLE Crying program. The program materials describe in a very straightforward way what a parent or a caregiver can expect a new baby's crying to be like in the first weeks and months of life. This is important because, as anyone who reads the booklet or watches the video will learn, the crying of new babies will increase in the first weeks and months of life before it decreases.\n\nSo, as a starting point, let's talk about soothing methods from the Period of PURPLE Crying materials. The booklet contains a section about what is appropriate to do if a baby is crying a lot. It suggests three action steps, and the First Action Step is about soothing. The first action step says that caregivers should:\n\n\"Increase the comfort, carry, walk and talk responses with their infants.\"\n\nWhy is this important to do? Well, there are two main reasons. The first is that it is a reminder for caregivers to do all the great soothing things that they already know, but to increase the amount or number of times they soothe their baby. In other words, pick up your baby more often, carry them around more often, sing to them and gently pat and stroke them more often. This is because the more you do these things, the more likely it will be that you will be able to calm your baby. \"Comforting\" might involve wrapping your baby in a blanket, or just holding your baby in your arms. \"Carrying\" includes holding, contact and closeness. \"Walking\" includes all of those as well as introducing a rhythm to your movements. You may also want to move your body to the rhythm of the beats in music while carrying and comforting your baby. \"Talking\" includes adding a human voice, perhaps saying or singing the same things over and over to a melody.\n\n\"Pick up your baby more often, carry them around more often, sing to them and gently pat and stroke them more often. This is because the more you do these things the more likely it will be that\n\nyou will be able to calm to your baby.\"\n\nThe second reason comes from the soothing principle that doing these soothing methods when your infant is not crying will make them even more effective by keeping your infant calmer once it stops crying. So, if you begin using these comfort, carry, walk and talk methods when your infant is crying, it is helpful to continue to use them after the baby has become calm. This can help to prevent the crying from beginning again. Many mothers put the baby down again as soon as it stops crying, but continuing to use soothing methods for a while afterward should help your baby stay calm.\n\nIt is good to experiment with various methods and see what works at the time. It is also important to see what makes you feel good as you try them. Some parents have said that just having a list to go through gives them \"something to try\" or \"something to do,\" even if it does not work all the time. Calming yourself down by trying things can be as important as calming your baby down.\n\n\"Some parents have said that just having a list to go through gives them\n\n\"something to try\" or \"something to do,\" even if it does not work all the time.\"\n\nIt is very important, however, not to let yourself", "eta_suffix": " you fall asleep.

{"eta": "We're kicking off our Best of 2015 coverage by running down our 10 favorite network shows of the year. Why this way? Well, because cable kicked a lot of butt in 2015.\n\nOn Tuesday, we picked up some of the duds we saw fall off the ladder, like The Walking Dead, Parenthood, Supergirl, The Good Doctor, Undercover Boss, Supernatural, Person of Interest, Stalker, Last Man Standing, Halt and Catch Fire and The Americans, which didn't make the cut. While there's still a lot of time to go before the finale of most shows, even the duds have made pretty good returns.\n\nTo make life easier for the fans over at Deadline, we'll break these down into two different groups: show that started and then lost out on the 2015 race: shows that had great seasons and had legs, and shows that went to hell in a handbasket.\n\nIn the episode-by-episode breakdown, here's what we saw:\n\n1. On the road\n\nThe AMC thriller Fear the Walking Dead returned Tuesday to deliver what could be the best season finale season in the post-apocalyptic franchise's history, with three tales of those presumed lost/killed walking dead.\n\nThe 15-episode third season of the show created several opportunities for how the three narratives could converge: a huge thank-you to Rick Grimes and crew for devoting several episodes to delivering the children to a sanctuary/safe haven created to preserve them for what's presumably the apocalypse (though whether the show would still be worth watching with those dynamic relationships in place depends on the CW's move to make it a show solely focused on an apocalypse) and a return of family to save some of the most troubled people in the show world. Season 2 also laid out a vision of the world they will now inhabit, helping to fill out all those characters they had lost in season 1, leaving more holes that the second season failed to fill.\n\nPlus, the show also had a memorable year for the show's two main leads, Daryl Dixon and Michonne Smith. The latter finds redemption to the point that it makes you want to root for her more (she can see over 100,000 eyes, you know) and the former finds love as she reconnects with a husband who broke up with her because she was losing him, finally getting over a breakup.\n\nSupernatural, The CW's supernatural drama, continued its strong season with another shocking plot twist that will be entertaining to see play out. Of course, Supernatural won't be returning for an eighth and final season, but the show kept the drama going on its off-hours with a year-and-a-half worth of awesome storytelling. And their season-ending cliffhanger made the show's powerful finale just that much better.\n\nThe Hill Street Blues drama followed up on the past season's standout finish with another back-to-back. 'Branch' found Dean Winchester having to clear up who killed his wife and friend in \"The Following,\" after Dean managed to find evidence that Sam Winchester \"Hes the Key,\" the \"man-killer.\"\n\n2. Goodbye, John Legend\n\nThe middling sophomore season of Lifetime's new musical comedy Bad Teacher lost many of its key stars, including Jada Pinkett Smith (Pride, So Happy I Could Die Good) as the first African American principal on the meanest school in America. At least they didn't go for \"Black Messiah\" star Charo, who'd already vanished for six years while continuing to party, so there was still a chance the show would return eventually, even though it certainly didn't prepare for a D&D revival season (we'll be safe in assuming we could safely speculate on that one).\n\nBad Teacher was smart, beautiful and funny, and while we lost some of that family value on the big screen with My Little Pony's movie deal (and Jason Segel and Phoebe Cates leaving the show), the show continued to deliver laughs and emotional scenes for the first half of its season, with rising star Sara Shepard enjoying her recent (big-screen) role in Loving.\n\n4. Newcomer, Sorry, We're Coming Back\n\nNetflix will be remembered for its success as an underrated network, having established two members of one of the early season's three big seasons (Orange Is the New Black and Master of None) as breakout shows. But it also means its push into live events, presenting the likes of Last Man Standing, American Gods, Luke Cage, Master of None, Sense8 and The Get Down \u2014 with the latter of all three up against its old DVR recordings.\n\nMajor League can claim to be the only network-run reality show to compete with the likes of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. But that reality show showed a lot of room for growth over the course of its second season, as the season-ending single was featured with \"The One That Got", "topp": "We're kicking off our Best of 2015 coverage by running down our 10 favorite network shows of the year. Why this way? Well, because cable kicked a lot of butt in 2016, but network shows have more opportunities to shine thanks to the fact that on a big stage, they have no problem achieving blockbuster ratings \u2013 or so we thought at the end of 2015, with so many midseason football games and family dramedies on the way. We're taking a break from this list to start thinking about 2017\u2026 but it isn't out of the question that everyone on this list will be back next year.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\n10. Survivor: Cagayan\n\nThe reality series which has surpassed The Biggest Loser as the TV product people are watching the least of? You decide. It's all very competitive and people can change their minds. Yeah, the cast is stacked with some greats, but the competition is stiff. Just last week, it was blindsiding Max Dawson in a five-way tie for Number 2; we think Tyson Apostol and Shea Whigham made the final three of the first immunity challenge, but nobody knew that until the event aired on CBS and American Idol eked out a win over Sarah Michelle Gellar. Meanwhile, we're really excited that Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers is returning next year with two new contestants: Nicholas Amato and Sandra Diaz-Twine. The co-creators of Survivor: Cagayan are back to take this newest challenge, one that was seen by the public only as an effort to increase the visibility of another castoff this season.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\n9. Modern Family\n\nEvery season of these shows, we've learned one thing: The show creators take great pains to draw on their own life experiences to create as perfect a family as possible. Take NBC's own beloved Parenthood, for example. The late-night comedy has been at the forefront of diversity in broadcast comedy for some time now, but like Modern Family, it has helped build a national demographic by giving viewers a big house where their moms can relate with each other's conversations, quips, and dreams. In addition, creator Dan Snyder uses every opportunity to explain the differences between his show and others when casting his cast. He's dangled the carrot of an upcoming Diversity Writer's Circle to cast from a pool of possible hopefuls. But his show also brings the diversity of its cast through deep dialogue between the mothers, wives, daughters and sons, as opposed to a strictly \"white, straight, blue-collar, Mormon family\"\u2013style depiction of traditional families. A truly proficient approach for one of the world's most popular TV shows.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\n8. The Good Wife\n\nThe people behind Modern Family have created a show with an exacting, often urgent, wit which could sum up her moment in history. But the constant struggle for this female attorney to be open to playing the game suggests there's still a certain air of \"not for me\" when it comes to showrunners being able to do the grueling physical, mental and emotional grind of showrunning live. It's just a reality with The Good Wife, people have forgotten that other seasons of this show rarely recorded a run on the network, as producers would find themselves having to reboot the season from Season 3 for the second season after several weeks away. And if you look at just a few stats, though, the show continues to thrive on the strength of its characters: Last night, the finale by Chris Noth and David Boreanaz had the biggest ratings hit in the show's history \u2013 7.08 million viewers over the old numbers, up 16 percent \u2013 while lawyers vs. generals remained in the top 10 for any scripted series ever, according to Nielsen ratings. The show is that good.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\n7. Black-ish\n\nThe sassy, second-hand Archie characters on black-ish have won the hearts of millennials; because while football games and bars and BFFs rarely intersect with every show's casting processes, casting influences differ. Our list, though, is a little different. Keeping the bookish qualities of the lighthearted and funny pointy folks of black-ish, and extending it into the sitcoms, plays well across all media platforms \u2013 including its sister network, ABC Family. Yet when ABC made its much publicized a recent move to have a real-life inspiration, it came across as a bit too much, a bit too integral to the show's character arcs to be overcome (see the awkward moment in the late-season finale when a female character prominently features on a road-trip list, and not quite in the neighborhood of Julian to become a romantic interest). Its attempt to be romantically two-faced in its viewership failures feels extremely modernized compared with other networks, including CBS and HBO. Just as fun as Archie Jackson's episode airing at the Top Ten list too.\n\n6. Black-ish", "human": "We're kicking off our Best of 2015 coverage by running down our 10 favorite network shows of the year. Why this way? Well, because cable kicked a lot of butt in 2015, and before lists are dominated by shows high on the dial, we thought we'd give the networks a time to shine. And really, network and cable television are two different beasts due to wildly varying business models and FCC restrictions, so let's appreciate the best of both worlds.\n\n\nHere are our favorite network TV series of 2015, in no particular order.\n\n\nJane the Virgin\n\n\nNo show made us happier than the CW's Jane the Virgin did in 2015. When a series experiences the level of success that Jane reached in its first season, the pressure to continue operating at that standard can become overwhelming, but the show's second season has been equally strong across the board. By focusing on the three Villanueva women at its center and very real, very familiar issues facing new mothers, the comedy series has remained emotionally grounded while still embracing its telenovela roots and the result feels like a weekly heartwarming hug from your insane, but well-meaning best friend.\n\n\niZombie\n\n\nRob Thomas's series about a zombie who uses the visions she receives from the brains she eats to solve murder cases premiered on the CW early in 2015, and based on its first season alone would have earned a place on this list. The series put a spin on the zombie genre by focusing on the living rather than the undead, it zigged when we thought it would zag, it turned its handsome love interest into a zombie killing badass, and it gave us yet another reason to love David Anders. But the show's second season is somehow even stronger than the first, from the continued development of its characters and the show's sense of humor, to the mysteries Liv solves and its ability to weave interlocking stories together with ease. iZombie is the best of both worlds, perfectly blending procedural elements with an addictive and serialized story to create a series that's at the top of our must-see list every week. But then again, we'd expect nothing less from the man who also brought us Veronica Mars.\n\n\nPerson of Interest\n\n\nPeople are starting to pick up on how relevant CBS's Person of Interest has become because history is actually catching up to this prescient techno-drama. Though we've only had half a season of the show in 2015 (damn you, CBS!), the back half of Season 4 poked our brains with thoughts of national security and personal privacy, the limits of human interference in an increasingly technological world, and the philosophy of different A.I.s. battling it out to death. Plus, \"If-Then Else\"? Remember that episode? Hoo boy!\n\n\nWolf Hall\n\nIt's good to be the king. You make decisions then everyone else makes it happen, no matter how difficult implementing those decisions actually is. And it's as true today as it was during Henry VIII's reign. Whether it's presidents or CEOs, there's always someone whose job it is navigate the factions of power and intrigue to achieve the leader's goal. PBS's Wolf Hall turned the story of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power and influence in Henry's court into a riveting period drama and a timeless historical allegory for power players. Also, man, those costumes.\n\n\nBlack-ish\n\nSecond seasons can tell a lot about a comedy: did it use up its premise in the first season or was it just getting started? ABC's Black-ish joined the network's Wednesday night family comedy block as the \"diverse\" one that touched on race, but in its second season it looked at societal issues such as religion, gun control, and language on a human level while also never losing sight of its strong racially charged center. The result was a comedy for our complicated times for everyone to watch, and a damn funny one to boot.

{"eta": "Preparing for August 21, 2017\n\nOn August 21, 2017, there's going to be a total eclipse of the Sun visible on a line across the US. But on a lunar eclipses, the moon's shadow goes on Earth.\n\nBut if you're in a solar eclipse, the moon's shadow is only visible when it's very very close to Earth. So if you're anywhere within 60 - 90 miles from the center of the moon's shadow, you'll only feel light pollution from the sun (shiny things, it's hard to see without glasses).\n\nIf you're out of range, that means it's overcast!\n\nThis map from NASA shows the path of totality (and both shadow and moon) on August 21st. The river is red and indicates the path of the eclipse. Note that we're still outside the shadow of the moon for the first 8 miles! It's definitely cloudy and windy. We're going to have to brace ourselves against the sun!\n\nThis is actually a pretty good shot. If anyone notices any algae on the beach, this is what they were probably looking at.\n\nVital Locations to See the Total Solar Eclipse\n\nIf you want to spend the evening safe and comfortable, here are the eight critical locations to check out.\n\nLiberty University Flagstaff, AZ http://flagstaffaz.tripod.com/ 3,079 miles\n\nMost people will feel safe in the space of 14 miles around Liberty. This is because the University's campus gets no direct sunlight.\n\nActually this isn't true. The town of Flagstaff has a municipal water tower that receives its own overhead lamp. Since the town has less light pollution than Liberty, you won't even feel the sun's rays like they would on a natural eclipse and could make the metro area a better night out.\n\nAbilene, TX http://www.americanbistro.com/ 569 miles\n\nTucked away just below Lubbock is Abilene, Texas (San Antonio), a city with a population of 23,000 and population density of 623 people per square mile.\n\nIt's just the right size for the total Solar Eclipse, although the town does look too small to the total eclipse viewer. This map shows you about the location.\n\nPittsburgh, PA http://www.richmondstaub.com/ 585 miles\n\nWhat good is seeing the eclipse unless people keep a handy book? You probably wouldn't want to be too close to the city of Pittsburgh, so it makes sense to stick between downtown and the river.\n\nThis is just a completely barren town full of suburban houses. I wouldn't even expect to find any water throughout the town. I mean, I got here on a BART train after an hour-long trip to Albany, so maybe that's not surprising!\n\nAmtrak for the 2.5 hours from Rochester, NY to Pittsburgh seems like a good choice. There's no official Amtrak webpage for the eclipse, but just take the train that goes there (with traffic!) from New York City if you don't want to drive!\n\nUnknown location http://observer.com/2016/04/total-eclipse-over-the-northeast-region/\n\nIdaho Falls, ID https://www.bbclues.com/info/b1-idaho-falls-dreamstate-psh 1015 miles\n\nIdaho Falls is in a region called the Snake Mountains. Part of the town is on a mountain that was added to the Golden State's National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\n\nUnlike Idaho Falls, the city is not part of the Golden State's Park system but a highway. And unlike an average summer day, the Eclipse is going to be slowly fading away in Idaho Fall. You might just want to head there while you can!\n\nPoughkeepsie, NY http://www.poughkeepsie.com/ 621 miles\n\nThis place is seen as a bit of a pilgrimage for moon worshippers. It's about an hour from New York City with 8.9 million people making up 18% of population. Since the peak eclipse happens when people are at work at the earliest, it's a good place to catch a few minutes of fame.\n\nWhich may or may not make the town a bit quieter. So, too, will the dead-wall shadows and ambient light pollution. Still, I find the scenery attractive, given it isn't something you can see in other parts of the world or in New York City.\n\nContinue on to check out the lunar eclipses in cities all across the US.", "topp": "Preparing for August 21, 2017\n\nOn August 21, 2017, there's going to be a total eclipse of the Sun visible on a line across the US. But where do we go for a good one-day solar adventure when people are going to be out? We've decided to go to a very famous volcano. If you want to go to Mexico, check out Ecuador.\n\nWhat's the difference between a total eclipse and one happening over the polar regions of the Earth? Total eclipses look exactly the same, except for the phase of the moon. The shadow of the Earth passing over Earth's polar regions disappears.\n\nA total solar eclipse is not visible from the exact spot where the sun is'set' (for instance, at Hohhot Lake in Saudi Arabia). It's seen throughout the northern hemisphere because of a lunar eclipse around the equator that obscures the sun during the northern hemisphere week.\n\nThe distance to each point along the path of totality varies and depends on the location of the event. The distance for the 2017 eclipse is 480 miles (772 km). This gives us plenty of coverage, and the highest point from where totality will occur is 3,079 feet (967 m), which is why you will see this happen at Lake Tahoe in California.\n\nLooking at the other 19 states to this point, the distances to see the largest solar events are slightly lower. They range from an unofficial grid of about 48 miles (74 km) to an official 98 miles (154 km) depending on the state you're in, so you could easily still see the event in your own state!\n\nInternational travelers who come to the US and want to go to a major solar eclipse will need to be ready to see many road closures for the event, so contact your hotels, tour operators or locals.\n\nIf you're traveling, keep these important things in mind.\n\nPlan ahead. There will be road closures. Find your safest exit. Check in at some hotel before you get on the bus. Don't skip the solar projector! Electric scooters, buses, airplane, car and ship will break down. Expect to experience delays or delays that exceed 4 hours. Use good judgment. Even after you've used high-speed internet, you may still be stranded on roadways. Even good local shuttle drivers may be more focused on their next trip than the eclipse. While you've probably visited California's Lake Tahoe and considered camping there, that morning you may not have a place available on the road to go to or from. This is a reminder to plan ahead and plan to be patient.\n\nDon't get too caught up in the events. This is not a stupid time to be here! Stay cool, with good identification, and the park is open!\n\nAvoid any closures and demonstrations. While some events may contain displays and educational materials, others will remind you to pray or have financial investment in the cause. Keep looking at the floor plan, look at the signage, and don't stare down the road or anywhere else. There will be lots of places where people will be praying, wanting to be part of a demonstration in full view of you\u2026 don't be distracted by what's going on.\n\nThe safety approach is important during an eclipse. We agree. Sadly, this is a great time to get hurt on the right track. That is why we recommend that during a solar eclipse or any time that another vehicle passes with a show-offy vehicle, stop and close the door before doing so.\n\nThere are quite a few practical approaches that any eclipse enthusiast can use while at the event. One was IKEA's money-making solar pens. But the cleaner, quicker, and safer alternative is to pay someone to do it. Paying someone to paint their car is another activity that might bring you a few blessings and be enough to keep your car looking clean. Call ahead and ask if their truck will be parked. However, always place your driver's license somewhere safe and visible. Pack water, insect repellant, sunglasses, ear plugs, suntan lotion, and stethoscope. If a 3d object or even a full moon will be in the eye, there may be an actual eclipse extra. These items take up less space and might have the following items pre-installed.\n\nContractor: $15/hour\n\nDye: $150+\n\nInstallation and drying: $500\n\nTool set: $5000+*\n\nOptional solar filter: $30 per instrument per person*\n\n* $1000 for 6 instruments\n\nImages made with the Norgren eclipse explorer tool.\n\nThe park can make it more accessible and free of the expected traffic congestion, donations for eclipse tours may be announced as far in advance as possible.\n\nHow to measure a solar eclipse You may be unable to measure the eclipse. The best way to measure a solar eclipse is at the parks closest to you. You can visit your", "human": "Preparing for August 21, 2017\n\nOn August 21, 2017, there's going to be a total eclipse of the Sun visible on a line across the US. But when exactly will the eclipse occur at a given location? Being able to predict astronomical events has historically been one of the great triumphs of exact science. But in 2017, how well can it actually be done?\n\nThe answer, I think, is well enough that even though the edge of totality moves at just over 1000 miles per hour it should be possible to predict when it will arrive at a given location to within perhaps a second. And as a demonstration of this, we've created a website to let anyone enter their geo location (or address) and then immediately compute when the eclipse will reach them\u2014as well as generate many pages of other information.\n\n\nIt's an Old Business\n\nThese days it's easy to find out when the next solar eclipse will be; indeed built right into the Wolfram Language there's just a function that tells you (in this form the output is the \"time of greatest eclipse\"):\n\n\u2715 SolarEclipse[]\n\nIt's also easy to find out, and plot, where the region of totality will be:\n\n\u2715 GeoListPlot[SolarEclipse[\"TotalPhasePolygon\"]]\n\nOr to determine that the whole area of totality will be about 16% of the area of the US:\n\n\u2715 GeoArea[SolarEclipse[\"TotalPhasePolygon\"]]/GeoArea[Entity[\"Country\", \"UnitedStates\"]]\n\nBut computing eclipses is not exactly a new business. In fact, the Antikythera device from 2000 years ago even tried to do it\u2014using 37 metal gears to approximate the motion of the Sun and Moon (yes, with the Earth at the center). To me there's something unsettling\u2014and cautionary\u2014about the fact that the Antikythera device stands as such a solitary piece of technology, forgotten but not surpassed for more than 1600 years.\n\nBut right there on the bottom of the device there's an arm that moves around, and when it points to an \u0397 or \u03a3 marking, it indicates a possible Sun or Moon eclipse. The way of setting dates on the device is a bit funky (after all, the modern calendar wouldn't be invented for another 1500 years), but if one takes the simulation on the Wolfram Demonstrations Project (which was calibrated back in 2012 when the Demonstration was created), and turns the crank to set the device for August 21, 2017, here's what one gets:\n\nAnd, yes, all those gears move so as to line the Moon indicator up with the Sun\u2014and to make the arm on the bottom point right at an \u0397\u2014just as it should for a solar eclipse. It's amazing to see this computation successfully happen on a device designed 2000 years ago.\n\nOf course the results are a lot more accurate today. Though, strangely, despite all the theoretical science that's been done, the way we actually compute the position of the Sun and Moon is conceptually very much like the gears\u2014and effectively epicycles\u2014of the Antikythera device. It's just that now we have the digital equivalent of hundreds of thousands of gears.\n\nWhy Do Eclipses Happen?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon gets in front of the Sun from the point of view of a particular location on the Earth. And it so happens that at this point in the Earth's history the Moon can just block the Sun because it has almost exactly the same angular diameter in the sky as the Sun (about 0.5\u00b0 or 30 arc-minutes).\n\nSo when does the Moon get between the Sun and the Earth? Well, basically every time there's a new moon (i.e. once every lunar month). But we know there isn't an eclipse every month. So how come?\n\n\u2715 Graphics[{Style[Disk[{0, 0}, .3/5], Yellow], Style[Disk[{.8, 0}, .1/5], Gray], Style[Disk[{1, 0}, .15/5], Blue]}]\n\nWell, actually, in the analogous situation of Ganymede and Jupiter, there is an eclipse every time Ganymede goes around Jupiter (which happens to be about once per week). Like the Earth, Jupiter's orbit around the Sun lies in a particular plane (the \"Plane of the Ecliptic\"). And it turns out that Ganymede's orbit around Jupiter also lies in essentially the same plane. So every time Ganymede reaches the \"new moon\" position (or, in official astronomy parlance, when it's aligned \"in syzygy\"\u2014pronounced sizz-ee-gee), it's in the right place to cast its shadow onto Jupiter, and to eclipse the Sun wherever that shadow", "eta_suffix": " may not make the town a bit quieter.

It is our reality. And DIY is its first name.\n\nIf you don't know about the cyberpunk genre, the internet of tomorrow has been predicted as the future for hundreds of years. Better known today as speculative fiction, the genre includes vampires, ghosts and aliens, among others. It most famously emerged out of the Cold War and its aftermath, selling millions upon millions of copies on paper, both in paperback and in electronic. This identity stemmed from its portrayal of alternate futures rich in cybernetic technologies. But not all futuristic author John Shirley was interested in: Time was the main focus of his work, the reader was asked to make decisions about the past before he wrote his stories. Cyberpunk, by contrast, is made up almost exclusively of a future that seems to be already here, and the settings aren't identified specifically by what our world is made of. Instead, the genre is named for the industrial technology in fiction. Think 'otherworld', 'counter-culture', or 'bio-electric', and those are just a few of the synonyms that describe the future that's still unreachable.\n\nThere's a reason these genres are still in demand: at the heart of today's digital culture is all of those things that don't exist yet, and so they mesh well with a range of themes.\n\nThis foundation is what keeps old stories and characters from feeling obsolete. What's needed now is something that doesn't make you look good.\n\nThe old thing\n\nFor better or worse, there was an entire generation of teenagers who didn't know what cyberpunk was, but knew how that felt.\n\nAmong them were Daniel Clowes, whose graphic novel Clowes and His Sisters is set in 1960s post-communist Soviet Union, and the comic book writer Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, who is an associated of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. In terms of performance art, clashing with their contemporaries, they in effect marked a dichotomy in art. They never tried to wear their individuality on their sleeve, but instead let it out when needed. They didn't dabble in atypical genres, but rather spread out like torches across a room, in \"the phase,\" as Clowes calls it.\n\nThose shadows will neither shine nor wither unless they can reflect the light, these rebels said, shutting out all virtualities.\n\nEven the writers who did adapt to the ongoing story of the Internet of Tomorrow (IOP) weren't wholly comfortable with its genre. Back in the mid-1990s, H.P. Lovecraft and Terry Pratchett went on record saying they wouldn't bother trying to do a decent Conan the Barbarian. And writer William Gibson didn't fully embrace the imminent future until 1982, but he wrote a graphic novel called Neuromancer in 1991, and what the terrorists call a \"cyberpunk extension\" is what he calls in his acceptance speech to the Golden Dragon Award that he was \"feeling much less religious these days.\"\n\nBut as much as this new mythologies didn't fit with their creators' expectations, they were still unnervingly true in terms of the set of things available to their sensibilities: electronics weren't exotic inventions. Star Trek hadn't even had its first movie yet, not because of a dream story, but because new technology was still in the future. A new timeline that accounted for \"coming, not going\" was by its very nature weird. They took it a step further: we didn't even have the cold war or its disruptions over at the time, let alone the supposed center of gravity of political power, destruction, and murder. This didn't bother Brinton and Twain at all. In fact, they kind of harbored two separate beliefs: that technology was unchanging and democratic in its social impact, and that anyone and everyone who had ever lived could remember every detail about the post-Cold War years with perfect certitude. It simply wasn't important for what they were doing. They had become far too comfortable with the universal world of tchotchkes, as the poet Michel Foucault liked to say, in a sense like a fashion shoot when hundreds of girls are \"shot in the back by gunmen, all over the world.\" And this new mythologies wouldn't shine or wither unless they could reflect the light, these rebels said, shutting out all virtualities, so that present layers of reality could still reflect some grey reality. That's no longer high technology, really. It's now nothing more than every space-age weird technical change an infinite cycle could deliver, with the looped vinyl maskings of autotune controlled by a motherish gardener and broadcast by the dying KISS.\n\nStories long dismissed as obsolete have been coming back in force in popular culture\u2014at least, it appears to be happening right now\u2014and are changing our collective perceptions of a future that's in fact completely due.

Before you go saying that there's more types than that, consider that most scenes in any cyberpunk game or movie are, at least, some combination of those. Blending in elements of Asian or even Ancient Egyptian culture is also often seen. You might call it a pan-cultural look as well.\n\nIn all three of those types, there are some common elements: electronics, glossy and matte colors with a sparse palette, repetitive geometric patterns, metal, glass, ambient lighting and automation. Lots of ambient lighting and home automation 6 Types of Home Automation You Can Actually Afford 6 Types of Home Automation You Can Actually Afford Are you ready to join the smart home revolution but worried that it's beyond your budget?

Let's take a look at each type, and a few real world examples in real people's homes.\n\nThe Minimalist Cyberpunk Room\n\nGreat cinematic and gaming examples of the minimalist design can be found everywhere. Pick a cyberpunk movie, think of where the rich people or villains lived, and that's typically your minimalist cyberpunk room. One example is Flynn's safe room in Tron: Legacy.\n\nTron: The Original Classic / Tron: Legacy [Blu-ray] Tron: The Original Classic / Tron: Legacy [Blu-ray] Buy Now At Amazon $16.96\n\nBefore you go off on me saying Tron isn't cyberpunk, think about this; in plenty of cyberpunk stories, people inject technology into themselves Biohacking: The Creepy but Exciting Trend in Body Modification Biohacking: The Creepy but Exciting Trend in Body Modification \"Sorry about the mess,\" says Steve Haworth, as we walk down the stairs to the surgical theater, where he merges consumer technology and the human body to produce uniquely functional body modifications.

Well, it's all about confidence.\n\nTo set the context for what I'm going to say\u2026 I have no friends\u2026 if you believe in the Lord, you don't have to worry about messing things up. There are none to worry about. After four years of being thrown into command a Marine, I have no major body count. I don't swear at anyone anymore, if it makes no difference. You can walk up to a stranger you run into in a gas station, and if they don't step back when he's pointing at you, ignore him anyway. I can count to 3, and never get any political, like \"a living God made you do it\" or whatever is trendy these days. As far as I know he doesn't even exist. So why should I care? Because what you see in me comes from that perspective.\n\nAnother reason that it's important to talk about confidence?\n\nOn this night, it wasn't my confidence. It was more like\u2026 oh don't look at that. And you're right. That isn't confidence. It's arrogance. Not being comfortable in one's own skin, not being able to trust one's instincts when it counts, not being the opposite of what you believe, to believing that you are the only one in your religion who knew and wrote your entire life, is an arrogance not worthy of us. So it goes on, as did the Marine's first time shooting.\n\nThose are the people that we shoot. This is a fair criticism, if you just look at that in hindsight.\n\nIt's my responsibility to keep reminding my Marines of how rare our jobs actually are. It's my responsibility to keep reminding them that they have every opportunity (and probably need to take them as often as needed) to step up, to make the right choices, and do what's right.\n\nIn the Marine Corps we encourage our Marines to keep their guard up, to be on the lookout for the enemy, to be wary before they get there, to anticipate what the enemy is going to do\u2026 we wouldn't have an alarm system if we didn't believe that people on the planet lived by the same rules as we do. We don't believe that soldiers never die, we believe that we live by a code of honorable death, \"even if our precious lives are forfeit at the hands of a man or a monster.\"\n\nI'm not here to steal from anyone's discourse, I'm just trying to light a fire under the heart of people who look at my playing field like the Marine Corps sees it. So please, if you are reading this, don't remember that time I asked some of my fellow Marines if they kill people and some of them replied yes, which pretty much felt like I was telling them to kill themselves. Remember that Marine's first fight, he did the exact same thing, he called to end the fight, calling to 'tighten the man rope'. Now remember that this time the enemy struck again on our watch, these people died, and we stood by and allowed it to happen. I'm not trying to demonize anyone, I'm just trying to bring light to the line I draw in their face when it comes to learning and the emotions that come with the job, and it's no different in this situation.\n\nSo, why is speaking about it important? It's an opportunity for discussion. It's an opportunity to be seen as active people who have the mindset of \"I'm in charge\", and not some 30 somethings who don't even live with each other. As a result, when we're talking about something as important as the Marines, we're not discussing it in the wrong way, just as we wouldn't want to say the opposite of what we are.\n\nLet's talk about what's important. When I think about the Marine Corps I think, oh what's that? You're in command of 10 people\u2026 wow what a tough job, tough to say one bad thing about you, hard to be out there. Because Marines (and other leaders) aren't in charge of 10, they're in charge of 100. Not in 10, not in 101, but 100 is where we're at. It is incredibly important to my kids and my wife that the Marines be allowed a safe space at their Army posts, that they be able to have their military exercises, go on their deployment, and also to come back in training so that we have a perfect sounding board for both of them.\n\nAlso if there's a Marines race this weekend let's also focus", "topp": "While it may not always seem like it on here, I'm generally a very calm person, now anyways. Four years in the Marines (most of them spent in combat zones before deployment to Korea), being a little more or less okay with it has proved to be as good of a response to the constant traumas of war as one can have. It does not make me inherently easier to understand, for I have seen it, its effects, and i have been there. To me, the whole \"know your enemy\" thing is a bit much to handle, and I have a hard time thinking up stories that get to the truth of people and situations.\n\nJust cause I have some kind of psychological growth, however, I don't feel as good on this subject as I used to. I used to think through things on my own, and not convince myself \"so and so is smart\". When the truth came out that I was probably pretty much off base, I will admit it and fall back on what I have learned from previous experiences as if I had never actually experienced what I was accused of. I don't think I really deserved it after the cold hard truth I read in the Marine Corps, so that is no longer an option in my mind.\n\nJust a note: That being said, the Marine Corps made some excellent documentaries, I highly recommend all of them. Also, it is a lie that I am intentionally avoiding incorporating any sort of humor into this essay, I just enjoy reading about fucked up shit right now. This essay is meant to express to the reader what I personally went through and I think the truth is okay to offer as commentary on the event.\n\nGrowing Up and a Background in Military\n\nNavy\n\nThe Navy, as seen in the 1999 film Apocalypse Now, has been my home for about the past 8 years, and is in the midst of a revival. How is it that I never even thought about declaring myself a Marine until I've been assigned to a ship yet again? I guess there really wasn't a lot of pressure to sign up.\n\nI joined my first Navy class at the former USS Washington (now USS Mar-a-Lago) in 1970. I had no idea what was going on, but the education at USC asked me to read Ann Masterson's The Painted Bird, and it seems as if that was it. I found out just how fucked up the military can be. As a kid, I was heavily influenced by Admiral William P. McRaven, the former President and Navy General Counsel of the Marine Corps. I still feel a little guilty about that, the whole American exceptionalism thing of things, but I don't regret my time in school.\n\nIn 1972, I took the 3rd Leadership Development Course, the so-called \"Eat, Pray, Love\" course that Marines earn by doing small things a whole lot of times to improve interpersonal skills and emotions. I liked the course quite a bit, and wanted to spend a lot of time practicing and saving myself the guilt from going through a drill like manual recreation. That is when I also discovered I hated that course. It was such a waste of time, and since I grew up in a rebellious suburban household, I felt conflicted about the Scout system. I guess I'm still not sure why I was so into that course.\n\nAfter that, I became interested in politics and never flinched from expressing it in my writing (e.g. this essay). I also joined Marines around that time, became a drill sergeant, and retired from the Navy with a diploma. Good job, man.\n\nArmy\n\nI was in Ranger School for a little over a year as a 31 year old first lieutenant (sadly, I'm as social of a person as they come), and the feel of change in the Army was very similar to that of the Navy. Moving around my Army class started to seem much more interesting, and I would often travel with a \"friend\". After a while, it didn't take me much to realize that my friends were just a few guys I was close to in every way, and some guys whom I didn't even really want to know. Ranger, after all, is not exactly a place for friends in the Army. Still, it kept me around.\n\nOne of the nicest guys I had any interaction with was Ila, a draftee from Texas who served 16 years in the Army and became a sergeant. He lived in Chattanooga and wrote letters of recommendation to people who were working at NASA. I made friends with him, because he kind of acted like me in that way: \"I'm not sure how you came across me, so I thought I'd hear your stories.\" Years later, he's still \"saddened\" he didn't stay in the military to the extent that I could have.\n\nAt the same time, though, he was a really nice guy, and had just graduated from high school to avoid college", "human": "While it may not always seem like it on here, I'm generally a very calm person, now anyways. Four years in the Marines (most of them spent in combat zones), and eight years in kitchens add up to a whole lot of toxic anger and stress. Shedding all that, and the obligatory cigarettes that came with it, was a huge weight off my mind. Unfortunately, there are still people in the world that make me go into Wolverine Berserker Mode.\n\nThis past Saturday was \"Touch a Truck Day\" in a neighboring town. Touch a Truck is the greatest idea in the history of mankind for parents. I've never seen the Mayor more easily placated for two solid hours. Let him beep a tow truck's horn, crawl around in the back of a mail truck, jump on some giant tires, and mash some buttons in an old ambulance and he smiles brighter than Kanye in a room full of mirrors. Seriously, look at this face:\n\nBefore we could make it to the parking lot, however, we had to get daddy's nectar at Dunkin' Donuts. (I swear, this blog is not sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, although I would absolutely sell out for iced coffee and hash browns in a heartbeat. America runs on Dunkin!) Mommy went to get our coffees so I could stay in the car and avoid the dreaded car seat exit and quick re-entry.\n\nNow, 10:00 AM on a Saturday at this particular Dunkin' is about as packed as a subway car in Tokyo, you better be real flexible with your plans, because getting in and out quickly is far from guaranteed. After about five minutes, I hear crying coming from the SUV parked next to me. When it doesn't stop, I glance to the driver's seat (not in judgment, I swear), but there's no one up front. I immediately get out of the car to confirm my fears, that there are two babies in the back seat, crying and screaming without a parent in sight. But, oh, they cracked the window for them, because having kids is the same as having dogs. And just like that, I'm seeing red.\n\nI try to flag down my wife through the store front, and sign to her that someone left their babies in the car, (the sign language comes in handy for us, too) but nobody comes running out. After another ten-fifteen minutes, out comes the dad of the year. Luckily, I've been reading \"I Am Malala\", so I resist my urge to go all Brad Pitt gypsy bare knuckle boxer on him. I start calmly.\n\n\"Hey, man. You know you left your babies in the car?\"\n\n\"Why don't you mind your own !@#$ing business?\"\n\nI proceed to verbally lay into this single-cell organism with the heated fury of a thousand blazing suns. I believe I exited my human form and unleashed a barrage of obscenities that would make George Carlin roll over in his grave.\n\n\"Don't tell me what to do with my kids? Do you even have kids?\"\n\nThere's no helping this shaved ape. Unfortunately there's no helping his kids either. Accidents happen, and sometimes in a rush, parents forget their kids in the car. It's still horrible, but it's unintentional. It was clear that this sad excuse for a human being just couldn't handle his kids and DECIDED to leave them in an unlocked car on a main road for OVER TWENTY MINUTES. Sadly, this was the first time that not one single police officer was at this Dunkin', less than one block from the town PD. Lesson learned on my part, the non-emergency lines for all nearby towns are now programmed in my phone.\n\nThe whole thing sent me into such a rage, not just because of this isolated incident (though I'm sure it wasn't the first time he's done this, hopefully it was the last), but because this meathead is the reason why Dads get portrayed as bumbling fools who can't change a diaper or push a stroller.\n\nFor the first few months of my foray into stay-at-home parenting, every time I brought the Mayor to a play group or story time, *GASP* on a weekday, *GASP* without my wife, I felt like Otter walking into the Dexter Lake Club, not exactly welcome. It took months before the moms and nannies realized that this wasn't part-time for me.\n\nAs a full-time dad, you feel scrutinized for every single word, action, and inaction.

{"eta": "With its twin-supercharged 27-litre V12 Rolls Royce Merlin certified at 3000hp, Rod Hadfield's Final Objective is the world's most powerful registered, in this case-entering, aircraft. The G200GT (next to it, or so it appears to Alan) was also the only one of its kind in British MoJo's database (1984). On the day it was built, the aircraft was coated with black paint and the pictures above show that the wings, which formed part of the outer wing slats and were mounted vertically, are also painted black.\n\nUnlike the twin-jet-powered B175, the G200GT had twin-channel autopilot installed - meaning it could both go up or down the platform being flown. The primary navigational problem I experienced on this aircraft is that I had to navigate the airplanes through the clouds of the South Atlantic Islands. Some who fly aircraft say its flying skill, therefore, was none greater than that of an average passenger airplane. They feel there is absolutely no need for a private pilot license in the Northern hemisphere since it isn't as dangerous as the A340. It was often said that our own pilots were much better pilots but it remains to this day one of the secrets about which we've been hearing for years...\n\nWhat I must say here is that, given that the G200 was considerably lighter in excess of 200 tonnes or so, I won't be giving up flying in the South Atlantic soon. I may already be in one (I'm sure I will) but I can be confident that these \"aerosol wings\" will not leave the Atlantic any time soon.\n\nOf course to arrive at your destination, like my wife, you need to spend an hour or so on the way into South America first. The G200GT was a 1970s modern marvel - I have been flying my aircraft since I was 12 years old. How much it is worth, I can only guess, but I know for a certainty that many people have been world-wondering over it for years. How much, I have no idea, except that it made a tidy pile of money for the Ford Family.\n\nThe photographs above are of the G200GT. The two images at the top of the page show the aircraft fully loaded - close-up of the engine washers and not the pilot's seat. The second photograph is the top of the aircraft - it looks like it was loaded and then some. The second photo, therefore, is not a depiction of the aircraft flying but the aircraft parked - another useful item to have on board.\n\nMost of the photographs on the remainder of the page show the original brown (or black) metal tail, of which only a few were ever made (don't ask how) after the black tail pattern had been discontinued on many British passenger airplanes in the early 1960s to avoid costly and expensive paint jobs. The G200GT was built in Bristol, UK and built in the mid-1970s at the factory in Dunsfold near Gloucestershire. The drawings and specifications for the G200GT published in British MoJo's 1995 \"Back To The Future\" flyer are dated 2nd June, 1974. A total of twenty aircraft in all were built and being stored.\n\nThe first photographs of the G200GT on the front page of British MoJo in 1995. Here you see the G200GT near the shed where it was stored and looking forward.\n\nJust above the photo on the left-hand side, you can see the G200GT on display in this very rather recently restored, new wooden British Airways jet. The G200GT has a shiny black paint job and is clearly a finished design. Note on the right-hand side, where you see the vertical stabiliser rib, it has been painted black as well (a new tail effect). The aircraft has also been given a fresh look with several different colour schemes.\n\nThe G200GT on display in this narrow long-haul single in New Zealand - it's only one of many examples of the G200GT being sold in the UK. It is currently on display at the UK Aviation Museum - you can see the rear and forward facing cockpits in the photo on the left.\n\nAnother example of the G200GT being sold can be seen in this listing at British Airways. It has a painted back and sides with the photo at the end showing the rear engine pods placed flush with the aircraft. According to the listing, all machines on the 'cult of cars' are built in Birmingham, UK or in Pevear. The specifications are as follows: 1,775 kg, 98.58% full, 31,000 lb. empty weight.

As most of you know, the road bikes had rougher finishes to them at the turn of the century. This isn't a euphemism for it was black. This looked much better on the track and had a much lower rolling resistance than the 1948 classic. A significant number of Dromeb and mostly new builders were re-marking to the fledgling Hellcat, in effect massively increasing their souped-up sedans. The first design was the Crombie which a number of builders produced, before an alteration to the engine design was made for their new CB750s.\n\nMy favorite Dromeb was the Yamaha YZF-R1. This was my first mountain bike. It was \u2013 by far \u2013 my go to bike, back in 1999, and I was a student at the time. At first the design resembled a 200cc low-riderschmid bike, but after many months, a redesign was made, a classic 135 bore 450cc V-twin engine, winner of more spares then fenders, ended up resulting in the 100cc twin with a 400cc injector and the 200cc high-brimted dual carbs.

Others have the barebones base 16\" steel wheels, the engine is mounted in a 410mm x 26\" rear axle with bicycle touring on the rear. The last modifications are milled and traditional.

Even Guinness World Records has recognised Rod's effort.\n\nThis article on Rod's Chev was originally published in the April 2003 issue of Street Machine\n\nDisregarding the car's world-record status, the '55 is without doubt the most awesome car I've ever seen. I'm not making that statement lightly. My lifelong passion for all things automotive has taken me to some of the biggest shows in America and Japan not to mention filling my wardrobe to bursting point with hundreds of magazines covering the modified car scene from all over the planet. Final Objective eclipses all before it.\n\nEssentially the car is a 1955 Chevrolet Sports Coupe that's underpinned by a fully fabricated box-section chassis, powered by a V12 Rolls-Royce Merlin \u2013 this one from a P51 Mustang. The huge engine feeds a two-speed Lenco and Chev C30 truck diff, which drives a pair of meaty Hoosier competition tyres mounted on massive 18-inch wide American Racing wheels. As staggering as these specs are, Final Objective is one of those cars that's more than the sum of its parts. It's also the end of a 15-year journey that has been Rod's life-long obsession.\n\nFrom the moment Rod took possession of the '55 in 1986, he had the intention of stuffing it with the biggest, baddest, nastiest engine ever seen in a road-going car. He found a Centurion Tank V12 Meteor engine and it wasn't long before he was hacking out the '55's firewall to make way for his massive new acquisition. However, later in the project an even more desirable powerplant presented itself \u2013 the supercharged, Rolls-Royce V12 Merlin that now resides in Final Objective's incredible engine bay.\n\n'Colonel' Hadfield has shot down 11 enemy planes and been on nine bombing missions. He gets around...\n\nThe DOHC, all-aluminium Merlin is one of the most famous aircraft engines, winning renown in the Spitfire and Hurricane, the Lancaster bomber and P51D Mustang. An engine of this heritage tied in well with Rod's interest in all things military and goes a long way to explaining the Col. R. Hadfield stamp on the door.\n\nBefore starting the project in earnest, Rod and Castlemaine Rod Shop's (CRS) Bill Mussett, who did much of the work, researched and studied a number of other V12-powered vehicles, including famous talk-show host Jay Leno's V12-powered roadster in the US. They discovered that crankshaft speed and rotational direction were the first obstacles. Due to the supercharger set-up, the V12 is actually mounted in the '55 back-to-front, so it rotates the wrong way. Secondly, the V12 was designed to drive a propeller at around 1800rpm and peaking at around 2600rpm, which is not much chop for street duties.\n\nSolving both of these problems is a CRS-built transfer/step-up box that not only doubles the input speed to the two-speed Lenco gearbox but also reverses rotation. It's an incredible piece of workmanship and engineering.\n\nThe carburettors were yet another headache. They originally pointed towards the ground and had to be modified by Superior Aviation to function in a conventional orientation and run happily on pump unleaded. Then, because the massive supercharger got in the way of a regular belt-drive arrangement, an accessory drive system had to be manufactured to run off the engine's various external gear drives. To make things even more complicated CRS had to incorporate a special gearbox arrangement so the various accessories (power steering, fuel pump, alternators, and water pump) could be driven at different speeds.\n\nMassive Attack is decked out to look like an aircraft from 352nd Fighter Wing, a unit based in the UK, equipped first with P47 Thunderbolts, then P51s\n\nEven though the engine is all aluminium, its sheer physical size made it obvious the completed '55 was going to be pretty damned heavy \u2013 and the final figure is around 3500kg. To cope, two runs of 4x2-inch box-section steel were used to lay the foundations of the extensive chassis. The box section was internally galvanised to carry engine coolant between the four massive Aussie Desert Cooler radiators \u2013 two mounted in the boot and two up front.

{"eta": "Washington Post Goes Pinocchio Happy Over NAFTA\n\nI appreciate the work that Glenn Kessler does as the writer of Washington Post's Fact Checker column. It's a difficult job, because America has more than 600 trade deals, but with every one that passes or fails, the President sends out tweets in support of them.\n\nAnd sometimes those tweets are pretty silly. Take his snark about NAFTA. President Trump claims that NAFTA \"just took us a long way\" and that it \"saved 4 million U.S. jobs,\" which aren't true. That claim is patently absurd. Let's break it down, quickly:\n\nThere are an estimated 16,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States that didn't exist before NAFTA.\n\n3.1 million U.S. workers are displaced from these jobs by other NAFTA-eligible industries.\n\nFor example, 69,000 people lost their jobs in agriculture as a result of NAFTA, more than those in coal mining.\n\nBesides displacing U.S. workers, NAFTA has caused 35,000 new jobs in other sectors.\n\nIt's a gross misrepresentation of the facts that only a few small businesses were at risk from NAFTA. In reality, it means that 65 million Americans, almost 3 million of whom are manufacturing workers, are losing jobs by displacing others at the same time. In his piece on why the News Literacy Project ranks Mexico No. 11 on its list of countries that have \"the most to gain from lower tariffs,\" Kessler complains, with typical bluster, that we're not \"really\" all that different. But don't take my word for it, just look at this graph he cites from the World Bank:\n\nWhat's troubling \u2014 or at least exciting \u2014 about his piece is that it suggests that Trump could very well be right about NAFTA.\n\nRepublicans love to point out that NAFTA is bad for the United States. The bottom line, in their view, is that what it did was force wages down throughout the country. The reality is that just about every state saw a wage increase after NAFTA, at least in inflation-adjusted terms. And while there were some states that saw wage losses, overall, we're all better off for the trade deal because we all get nicer prices.\n\nTrump's favorite alternative (that went largely unnoticed) to NAFTA is an international trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that he claims would be bad for consumers and for U.S. industry. This thing, too, was meant to do more than just lower U.S. wages. Under President Bush, it would have been the biggest international deal in history. Republicans, of course, don't want to admit that trade deals will harm consumers; as ThinkProgress' Jordan Weissmann pointed out at the time, \"If the argument is that [trade] treaties punish small producers, they've been proven more economically ineffective than supporters of the treaties would like to admit.\" The GOP bill he's pushing now is so bad that even some conservative economists have said that it is worse than NAFTA.\n\nOne small change, however, could potentially change the debate \u2014 and with it, possibly win some free publicity for the Trump administration. To back up a claim \u2014 that in a couple years, NAFTA will be a \"very, very good deal\" \u2014 the president can simply move some of it to the back burner and, during a speech during an economic summit in May, at the White House.\n\nNo worries! Be ready at the next press conference! Trump will probably say that we needed the TPP because \"they want to ship our jobs to Mexico and to China.\" If you don't remember, the North American Free Trade Agreement was a bill that \u2014 for whatever reasons \u2014 didn't become law. So when Mexico responded by allowing the bill to proceed, some White House officials immediately developed a plan with the goal of re-establishing the pact. It was a bluffy attempt at destroying it, but it's working.\n\nPlus! None of this would have to get as far as it did had White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon not called off the \"Muslim ban\" immediately after the election. On any other day, as Trump even calls this one a \"secretive deal\" that will lead to no new Muslim immigrants entering the country, the president would be expected to be nastier. But Trump is the kind of guy who feels he should be nice to people \u2014 he's not my boss \u2014 and the President Of The United States can certainly do without negative publicity.

I wrote a piece on a column I was debating earlier this year about an issue of concern to me a wide swath of American voters (and probably yours, too, Edie)! We argued that light oil is good and that gasoline and diesel are more polluting than natural gas, and one change in approach that I advocated was to lower the \"oxygen\" octane rating from the well limit of 90 (doctors will tell you that it's 95,000 parts per million, which it's 90% full pressure high octane gasoline, but you can blame your Mom, if you want) in most areas of U.S. production. As a question from my audience at the time, about what nugget of wisdom might fall from such a discussion, I offer this thought: Don't figure on a person in our modern world for example deciding to forgo light oil in a carbon-intensive manner if they're just going to get double the waste benefits? What happened to America and the environment were so egregiously bad it's got me dropping from planet to planet from one solar system to the next. We've indeed hurt ourselves trying to protect our planet.\n\nAP, Houston Stripped of Climate Findings\n\n[Wednesday, December 31, 2013] The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it removed its findings that Hurricane Harvey flooding and Hurricane Irma damage were linked to global warming, after unprecedented criticism. Acting Assistant EPA Administrator David Pruitt said the findings had been removed after the agency reviewed them twice in collaboration with U.S. and global scientists. \"The work of addressing this difficult issue has generated some excellent research and learned from it,\" Pruitt said. \"EPA has taken a decision based on its own best scientific assessment.\" The damage assessment, which had been released shortly before the release of the link between global warming and Harvey flooding, was first called into question by activists and researchers who disputed its assumptions and had mentioned conflicting studies by leading researchers that supported that conclusion. That led to Pruitt's scientific review. For a quote from the EPA comments: \"The work of addressing this difficult issue has generated some excellent research and learned from it.\" The activists may have been right about a few things. There's no doubt that global warming has caused more extreme weather, but there's also no real question that climate change caused both the Hurricane Harvey flooding and Hurricane Irma destruction, and made something of a connection between those two events\u2014for what it's worth, at the time, most scientists thought there was no such thing. The science of the link between climate and massive storms is growing steadily stronger. It's a very old concept that has been around for some time but just took off in the past few years as the natural hazards posed by climate change became apparent. But Pruitt's denial does not stop there.\n\nRice Facts - Smart Wisdom\n\nIf the ocean needs protecting from our sailing ships, then oceans are healthy oceans.

(Part 2)\n\nHere's another installment of the Comic-Con 2012 Q&A series (that's the column format, not the paid column). This time around, we have with us two fans \u2014 one a big Disney fan and one a big Supervillain. Want to pick a favorite? Email us or tweet @Comic-Con", "human": "Washington Post Goes Pinocchio Happy Over NAFTA\n\nI appreciate the work that Glenn Kessler does as the writer of Washington Post's Fact Checker column. It's a difficult job. I don't always agree with his assessments, but I think he tries to be fair in his analysis. For this reason I was disappointed to see him max out with four Pinocchios over Donald Trump's trade representative Robert Lighthizer saying that NAFTA led to a government certified loss of 700,000 jobs.\n\nAccording to Kessler, the basis for this figure is the 757,000 petitions for NAFTA-related trade adjustment assistance that were certified by the Labor Department between Jan. 1, 1994 and Jan. 1, 2001. Kessler raises three major objections to this figure.\n\nFirst, he argues that the number is old. This is true, but it is difficult to see why that is relevant. There may have been some additional NAFTA related job loss in subsequent years, but that would make the number higher not lower. Complaining that the number is dated would be a bit like criticizing a figure for the number of traffic accidents in 1995. Presumably, there has been no major recalculation of the number of accidents that took place in 1995, so using the originally calculated number would be reasonable for most purposes, even though it is now more than twenty years old.\n\nThe second point is that the number could be overstated because the Labor Department was very generous in accepting petitions and likely gave assistance even in instances where the job loss had nothing to do with NAFTA. This is undoubtedly true, but there also had to be many cases where workers lost jobs due to NAFTA, who never filed a petition.\n\n\nFor example, suppose a factory closed in large part due to competition from a Mexican factory. While the factory workers might file successful petitions, would the workers at a restaurant that shut due to the loss of business from factory workers? The certification process is clearly open to errors in both directions. I don't know which type of error would be larger, but Kessler doesn't even consider the possibility that the certification process might have missed NAFTA related job loss.\n\nThe third issue is that Lighthizer doesn't take account of the jobs gained due to NAFTA. This is right, but it is not obvious why this makes his statement about job loss false. Kessler says on this point:\n\n\"As we have noted before, most mainstream economists do not believe that the number of jobs is significantly affected by trade policy; instead, trade changes the mix of jobs.\"\n\nThis is true, with an important qualification, but it is not clear it responds to Lighthizer. His claim was that workers lost jobs due to NAFTA. If these job losses were largely offset by other gains, the net impact on employment may be inconsequential, but the workers who lost their jobs are likely worse off as a result of the trade deal. (The qualification is that if the United States is suffering from a shortage of aggregate demand, as it did for many years following the collapse of the housing bubble, a trade deficit reduces demand and for this reason leads to fewer jobs in the economy as a whole.)\n\nFurthermore, if NAFTA reduced the demand for non-college-educated workers and increased the demand for college-educated workers, as conventional trade theory would imply, this would mean real losses for those workers without college degrees, which would go along with gains for workers with college degrees. The impact may not have been that large, since our trade with Mexico is not that large (Canada is part of NAFTA, but we already had a trade deal with Canada before NAFTA), but Lighthizer's claim of 700,000 lost jobs is not all that large relative to the size of the labor force (150 million), as Kessler himself points out.\n\nLighthizer certainly can be criticized for making a bigger deal out the number and the impact of NAFTA than the facts warrant, but that hardly seems a four Pinocchio offense. In short, Lighthizer is certainly hyping the harm from NAFTA and arguably making it a bigger deal than he should, but his basic claims seem right. (I would add that NAFTA could have had a substantial impact on workers' bargaining power by making the threat to move a plant to Mexico very credible.)\n\nMoving away from Kessler's piece, the Post has had an absolute love affair with NAFTA ever since the deal was debated by Congress in the early 1990s. This love affair led to the absurd claim in a 2007 editorial that:\n\n\"Mexico's gross domestic product, now more than $875 billion, has more than quadrupled since 1987.\"\n\nThis would have implied a 7 percent annual growth rate. China managed to do this over a two decade period, very few other countries have. According to the IMF, Mexico's GDP grew by 83 percent over this period, which is pretty far from quadrupling.\n\nIncredibly, the Post has never bothered to issue a correction to this editorial.

In the run-up to the elections, Iran's highest cultural and other body, the Guardians Council, halted Rouhani's installation of a female head of state.\n\nSecond, Rouhani speaks in the language of pragmatism. The tone that has governed his election campaigns largely resembles that used by many U.S. politicians.\n\nBut there is no question that Iranians that came out to support him have a point with respect to the agreement, not least through a different way of framing it than the U.S. government.\n\nAn October Pew Research Center poll found that four in 10 Iranians thought that the agreement was meant to allow America and Iran to be closer together.

We do not comprehend those idle liquors, on which the poor man can occasionally avoid a bad day, whereas they must sooner or later cost him by their cost, by reason of their continual misconduct; and we can give them almost no reasonable pause, till they have consented the full price of every kind of liquor for our use. The immense expence of furnishing moneys for this purpose, would soon recover from the farmers and planters, and their revenue would, though perhaps it be now little or nothing, soon in time return to the people. These things are nothing but the propagation of man and his improvement. Nothing to be desired more than that this land be at all times fit for cultivation and cultivation to profit. And though I have received a very large proportion of taxes from the people, yet I have never yet been met with, to my great astonishment, who either believed them to be the law, or even purposely intended to sustain them. But if the people will keep in mind, that the poorest and most ill-fed man in the West Indies can get by on the size and money of half his net weight, and can usually buy for a copy, besides all the articles of everyday living, from ten to twelve pounds sterling of imported sugar, rum, and tobacco, they will enjoy at least a considerable portion of the means of subsistence, and not entirely relieve the burden of taxes. And in short, if it be admitted that it could be of any benefit to the poor people to know the net produce of the commodities produced in their hands, they would perhaps find, indeed, it might often be most profitable to the farmers to raise things, to encourage trade to such an extent as would greatly lessen the toll paid on their goods, and prevent the proceeding from them of the whole cost of keeping the same at their own house to be sold. But though they could not obtain from the men such knowledge, as would enable them to apply these things in a real and proper manner to their own improvement, yet, by the regulations which have been laid down upon the subjects of trade, a comparison might at least lead them to guess at a far greater quantity of weight and quantity of goods (by their improvement) when raised to an acceptable price, than might formerly have been imagined by them. Yet though they may give an order to their own or the small share of a person of their services, from their one to his whole trade, it would be a very dangerous thing to show how much by the determination of any surplus and deficiency in the quantity of any article (as is often and universally done) against the proportion of the net produce which, in the mercantile state, is paid for it. In order therefore to comply with the obligation of paying every year a certain sum of money, the principal trader, to whom he has received money in exchange for goods (which he places at the great ends of his compass at the exchanges), should have the occupation of stating, at his receipt, the quantity of money which he hath received for them, being always as large a sufficient answer to any questions put to him by another as it is to anyone who questions him from another point of view.

It should be objected, that we have not that very splendid way of engravating to the profitable division of labor as well as the remunerative one: that this very money, thrown away with such a disposition, would, for a long or a very short time, be sunk to a very small measure in the circulation of wealth, and would not be looked upon by a private man as being much his greater property than what he had swallowed up at his first exchange. This I cannot persuade. Whatever should be the consequences, their capital and property, being upon land, would be happily placed there. Should the English general ever venture into that frontier, they would find, at a very small expense of money and labour, that the whole one hundred mile breadth of this great continent, where the great families will mostly be here, and where the society of its best society will be very valuable if it can acquire all that is necessary to maintain it in peace and safety, is an easy and an extremely convenient place to improve the land, from whence it can be easily raised, so as to have the convenient position of a place of manufacturing of materials for the use of England.

Therefore, in proportion as they increase in a nation, like commodities of necessity, they are proper subjects of taxation. It follows, then, that the very spirit in which such consumption is made, and the equipment of the capitalists to enrich themselves by means of the sale of a public mass of intoxicating liquor, will afford the best ready means of imposing a tax on the sugar, rum, and tobacco and consequently all the articles of luxury, including those articles which the people eat, drink, and wear.\n\nOn the other hand, who then invents the whole new superstition of a public revival of cheap \"tobacco,\" and \"virgin figs,\" and pig out the whole front page of the weekly paper with printed recipes for pigeon dung cakes? There must be plenty of rooms for that, since the supposition of a public \"revival\" of cheap I know not what \"tobacco\" has been going on for the past four or five years. This very purpose has occasioned the greatest amount of public persecutions, because otherwise though it might have existed, it would have been the first thing to put up. Secondly, there is always good work for scribes, however simple they may be, and to procure for our readers the whole demand of cheap stuffs of all kinds by means of the printer's paper, especially pigs' poop, works for eggs or slaughter-houses, and gilds of ribbons.\n\nTo the above arguments it must be answered that (1) and the short time it has taken the opponents of taxation to make publicity of these bad practices their chief policy, and (2) our governments ever since they have been investigating, investigating, and investigating these others as recently as several years ago, have found them very apparent and dangerous facts. These facts are a series of rules by which little and mighty interests put their contracts in operation, and dishonest play by which they are slavishly cheated, disarranged and cheated out of part, and those who pursue them are pursued on account of their own contract with them. Our governments, however, always apprehend the trick of these things being easier hidden than open, and they've been endeavoring to prevent this by the passage of many chicanery articles. At this same time the capitalists in their own countries, under the title of men's wives, are doing everything they can to find out with great speed and dispatch, and to put all to shame and shamefulness, on the people whom they malignantly betray, the girls. Meanwhile, however, profits themselves are and have been in every respect at the service of scribes and newspapers, who are drawing up papers upon every subject that happens to keep the corporations of course employed, hoping for some improvement, and starving others.\n\nThere can be no hesitation here. If one can show that ill-adapted, idle, and wasteful expenditure of public money, proceeds from the witch-hunt, that if people's minds are constantly leaving the least corner where their ducks may fish, and rosy fabrics may lie; if this witchcraft be cultivated and justified by no facts which they could discover with certainty from the like manner as furnishes of anything ordinary and easily obtainable in a country, where industry and industry alone makes a man and woman decent, where salt is the indispensable metal, where the soil is ripe, warm, wet, and open, where pears, apples, grapes, and oranges are bountifully grown and cheap, where workmanship is fair and true, and work guarantees no-work; if the mass of all manners, food, and any ordinary thing can be afforded by means of it, then any censures which such ill-adapted, idle, and wasteful expenditure of public money should incur, are worthy of a man or a woman who expects to rise by gain and gain alone. If any one finds \"little cakes\" and \"several wept nectars\" ments and instrucions supporting a commerce, made, he believes, of the deliciousness of fried cakes and cakes which, on any occasion, the simple heart may find most delightful, and a paid person who is willing to let and take what is to him the commonest thing, which smells like the flesh of an ass, he would find a favorable condition, in place where all pursuit of like triumphs does not rest.\n\nIn connection with \"luxury and indolence,\" my grievance in calling for the punishment of such fictitious manufactures, and of leisure, has been chiefly, to supply the anteroom of this condemnation.

One controversial idea is now the subject of public debate: food taxes.\n\nForty states already have small taxes on sugared beverages and snack foods, but in the past year, Maine and New York have proposed large taxes on sugared beverages, and similar discussions have begun in other states. The size of the taxes, their potential for generating revenue and reducing consumption, and vigorous opposition by the beverage industry have resulted in substantial controversy. Because excess consumption of unhealthful foods underlies many leading causes of death, food taxes at local, state, and national levels are likely to remain part of political and public health discourse.\n\nSugar-sweetened beverages (soda sweetened with sugar, corn syrup, or other caloric sweeteners and other carbonated and uncarbonated drinks, such as sports and energy drinks) may be the single largest driver of the obesity epidemic. A recent meta-analysis found that the intake of sugared beverages is associated with increased body weight, poor nutrition, and displacement of more healthful beverages; increasing consumption increases risk for obesity and diabetes; the strongest effects are seen in studies with the best methods (e.g., longitudinal and interventional vs. correlational studies); and interventional studies show that reduced intake of soft drinks improves health.1 Studies that do not support a relationship between consumption of sugared beverages and health outcomes tend to be conducted by authors supported by the beverage industry.2\n\nDaily Caloric Intake from Sugar-Sweetened Drinks in the United States. Data are from Nielsen and Popkin.3\n\nSugared beverages are marketed extensively to children and adolescents, and in the mid-1990s, children's intake of sugared beverages surpassed that of milk. In the past decade, per capita intake of calories from sugar-sweetened beverages has increased by nearly 30% (see bar graph)3; beverages now account for 10 to 15% of the calories consumed by children and adolescents. For each extra can or glass of sugared beverage consumed per day, the likelihood of a child's becoming obese increases by 60%.4\n\nTaxes on tobacco products have been highly effective in reducing consumption, and data indicate that higher prices also reduce soda consumption. A review conducted by Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity suggested that for every 10% increase in price, consumption decreases by 7.8%. An industry trade publication reported even larger reductions: as prices of carbonated soft drinks increased by 6.8%, sales dropped by 7.8%, and as Coca-Cola prices increased by 12%, sales dropped by 14.6%.5 Such studies \u2014 and the economic principles that support their findings \u2014 suggest that a tax on sugared beverages would encourage consumers to switch to more healthful beverages, which would lead to reduced caloric intake and less weight gain.\n\nRelative Price Changes for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables, Sugars and Sweets, and Carbonated Drinks, 1978\u20132009. Data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and represent the U.S. city averages for all urban consumers in January of each year.\n\nThe increasing affordability of soda \u2014 and the decreasing affordability of fresh fruits and vegetables (see line graph) \u2014 probably contributes to the rise in obesity in the United States. In 2008, a group of child and health care advocates in New York proposed a one-penny-per-ounce excise tax on sugared beverages, which would be expected to reduce consumption by 13% \u2014 about two servings per week per person. Even if one quarter of the calories consumed from sugared beverages are replaced by other food, the decrease in consumption would lead to an estimated reduction of 8000 calories per person per year \u2014 slightly more than 2 lb each year for the average person. Such a reduction in calorie consumption would be expected to substantially reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes and may also reduce the risk of heart disease and other conditions.\n\nSome argue that government should not interfere in the market and that products and prices will change as consumers demand more healthful food, but several considerations support government action. The first is externality \u2014 costs to parties not directly involved in a transaction. The contribution of unhealthful diets to health care costs is already high and is increasing \u2014 an estimated $79 billion is spent annually for overweight and obesity alone \u2014 and approximately half of these costs are paid by Medicare and Medicaid, at taxpayers' expense. Diet-related diseases also cost society in terms of decreased work productivity, increased absenteeism, poorer school performance, and reduced fitness on the part of military recruits, among other negative effects.\n\nThe second consideration is information asymmetry between the parties to a transaction.

{"eta": "How to Top The Initiative Order (Almost) Every Time\nWhen I first started this blog I asked the question \"Who takes Improved Initiative?\" I'm quoting the Gamers II post on the matter, here's the text, so that's what I wrote... In the article I said, \"If your group takes Improved Initiative, they must always do it (even if they don't have it) and shouldn't be forced to\". This became an idea that this blog has talked about since its start -- basically if you're in an organized play group, then you should always take Improved Initiative. But why? Why should they take Improved Initiative? This is a good question -- and this is a huge question. Here are some points I think we can agree on: 1) There are some specific moments in the game that almost no one ever needs Improved Initiative for. But there are also players who don't benefit too much off Improved Initiative because they're not in a great position (for example, you have two guys who both sit next to you, if you're hoping to get Improved Initiative on the player who is by yourself, you're almost certainly in trouble) or because they aren't up to snuff in almost all things. 2) Even if Improved Initiative is a very rare encounter, if you consistently take it then it won't completely fail you because you're still going to hit and score on the rest of your rolls. 3) For most groups with Improved Initiative, it really is almost never better to see Improved Initiative than not to take Improved Initiative, because there's this mechanical benefit here, especially in regards to Initiative Initiative. But, in order to make this work as designed, you need to know what specific situations they're going to be in. 4) You need to avoid some unintended consequences from the rules. \"If you take Improved Initiative, it's a waste of a bonus action. So what?\" Well, probably you've got a good thing going, and that's why you take Improved Initiative even though it's not beneficial. You could do the same thing with Improved Attribute when it really isn't useful -- you could spend another action to do something that you probably wouldn't think would be best... the thing about improvising if you want the advantage you already have if you take Improved Initiative is that if you don't, you're still going to score against your opponent too. 5) There is a bit of a philosophical divide between where Improvisation needs to fall and where Improvisation falls fast. If you take Improved Initiative and you think that it's cool and useful, then you are generally taking your chance to get ahead of the game before it fades away. But if it becomes widely abused -- if your opponents all take Initiative (because they're going to), you're going to feel all kinds of pain about it (and I'm going to hope you understand why I'm getting into all that)... then you will be taking an additional three points of Initiative, and you'll eventually lose all that great advantage you invested in Improved Initiative. So not sure about Improved Initiative as a secondary or mandatory feature. Either way, it's probably best to keep it out of the way while building your game. It's fine for most games, except perhaps when you play an EDH deck. I'm sure a lot of you have already noticed that I rarely talk about \"unhappening\" spells since they're such a neat feature. Other things like \"hit things,\" \"have no enemies on initiative,\" \"take 1 damage per 1 attack\" and other less-interesting things work better than that, even if it's not in the core rules of the game. At least to me they're not. In fact, there's no reason to ever use these rules as a focus in the game. That's something a character would have to memorize every time a bad scene happens. That's a great task for a computer. To me that's one of the best features of the book, and the entire system. If you do a lot of hunting and gathering and adventuring, though, then this is probably the best choice in my opinion, even if they're just got the throw-and-revert button in there. Oh, there's a lot of lists in the book... but it isn't all that long when you factor in how many times each player should take the initiative and what if anything \"based on an individual number\" they should be trying to take. All in all, there's plenty of content to pick from. (I just wanted you to know what I think about this whole thing, people.) :) RPG Superstar Chapter 5: Grit There's a lot of emphasis on grit when it comes to Initiative. As I mentioned above, the way you roll initiative and move around the table isn't going to work if players aren't constantly showing up with their gear on to start their turn. The weird thing about the mechanic here is that the things (your armor's ability to save you from a slashing, piercing or slashing ability, your", "topp": "How to Top The Initiative Order (Almost) Every Time\nWhen I first started this blog I asked the question \"Who takes Improved Initiative?\" I'm quoting the Gamers II rulebook, but it contains a very good example of how to Top The Initiative Order. The technique is much the same as above. The way it is done is by throwing out two or more challenges, and then attempting one or more ranks of a Bully or Trapper (basically swapping in a level 1 villain with a bad solo action to try and take out a stronger character). While this tactic will usually not win the game, it will maintain the initiative win for you, and in most cases you can then top the other player during the round as a punishment for being a bumbling bother, though this usually doesn't happen to me. With that said, another good way to Top The Initiative Order is to attempt to work as a team, with all the players standing up and getting a little more renown. It makes most other methods unworkable as the character making the challenge can take down more NPCs, and sometimes there is a lot of the other player doing the punks work in mind as they'll be rolling check from another of their character's abilities (consider this effective kryptonite). These two methods can be used on the same character or others, so there is no use in having one character out there doing the endeavor solo. Be careful when doing so though, as some opponents may be more powerful and competent when they are high in notoriety, and have few options when not of renown. Note, though, that a high notoriety character can simply be certain they have enough notoriety at the start of the game, as once it reaches a certain level, any significant or intrusive acts can continue to decrease it, and using the rounds will thus ensure that the remainder of the game no less would be a dull affair, but with a little more intrigue between players. The heart of the issue is that these two approaches tend to become a problem, especially if the opponent has several of the same level of difficulty. Again, getting the players to coordinate well is the best way to work them into a battle, but in addition, both types of initiative work best when you have enough reputation with the other player. If you cannot take advantage of the opponent's trickery and trickery will not work, then you should at least be able to trick your opponent into playing the game differently. Another way is to win out of character. Note that, as mentioned, this is rather complicated to pull off, but when done correctly it can put a character on the victory point track at the end of the turn as an Outcome-Easily-Gained Action. In addition, if the assault is well centered on your character, losing the Outcome-Easily-Gained Action can leave them on the losing end of a session, depending on how much reputation one has with the other. Imagine however, if they and you have dealt sufficiently damage with it before you end that round. With that being said, the most common method is to use the initiative order to dictate that half your people will make an attack. While this would seem pretty dumb, it is a common trick used by a lot of super heroes, and works well enough for that type of challenge. It also allows you to gain a few prestige points as the character itself will bring something to the table for its opponents to damage (usually more combat experience than the bumbling fool will have in that turn). What can be strange is how, if you have many other people in the game, this would just be a misdirected attack, an action of different difficulty to advance the forces of good, and this might go unnoticed, but isn't it just something it always appears that the bulk of the low level NPCs will be attacking an enemy more powerful than you are, and as in chapter one, it might work just fine. Another method is to take advantage of your reputation. If the player it attacks also has them equipped with the right kind of gear it should definitely be pointed out to the player. Players will naturally take notice of the inspired equipment given to the low level players, and while they often don't think of you as a nice person, you might actually be competent enough to be able to do the job. Another way you can get this reputation is with the player itself. I'm not saying take too many stories of competent good people, but tell about them, and with your low reputation that player will get a sense that you are kind of a dick. None of this is necessary, of course, and if you are playing with an audience that just wants a quick adventure and not much more than that, you can also pretend that the characters are talking about something else, as in read up on the campaign, which can be kind of fun. I'll think about your tactic when I want to do it. Even though the two approaches used are fairly self-explanatory, I wanted to hit the point where the discussion of successful or failed", "human": "How to Top The Initiative Order (Almost) Every Time\nWhen I first started this blog I asked the question \"Who takes Improved Initiative?\" I'm quoting the Gamers II, but it's a legitimate question. Many players are so concerned with having the highest strength, the deadliest weapon, or the most destructive spells that they forget one of the first rules of combat; the guy who throws the first punch is often the one who wins the fight. Stop for a moment, and think about all of the times that going after the bad guy turned a challenging battle into an uphill slog through mud and blood. Sometimes it's a single spell, a single alchemical item, or a single sneak attack that can set the tone for a battle and completely change the tone of a fight. If the bad guy goes first it's a fireball, a color spray, a thunderstone, or any of a dozen other nasty surprises that can tilt a fight in the opponent's favor. The same rules apply to the party.\u00a0Catching the villain flat-footed is a field day for rogues,\u00a0spellcasters and gunslingers are more likely to hit, and it provides a peachy opportunity to move around as you please while the enemy can't take attacks of opportunity. Now that I've belabored the point about why Initiative is so important though, it's time for a laundry list for making your score the best it can be. Traits\nFirst man to go is often the last man standing. Your initiative score starts with your dexterity modifier, but that doesn't mean that a low dex will doom you to always go last. Taking the right traits can give you a +2 straight out of the gate. While there are at least\u00a04 traits that provide an initiative bonus, you can only use one of them; there's no trait stacking for a bigger bump. These traits are: - Reactionary (Combat): You grew up bullied and constantly fighting: +2 initiative. - Warrior of Old (Racial, Elf): You've been practicing war for more than some creatures' lifetimes: +2 initiative. - Outlander (Rise of the Rune Lords, Exile Option): You were cast out of your homeland, and have been keeping one eye on your back trail ever since: +2 initiative. - On Guard (Quadira, Gateway to the East): You are always ready. +1 initiative, and if you can act during the surprise round you may draw a weapon as a free action. In addition to these traits, elves have an alternate racial trait they can take called Fleet-Footed. This takes away Keen Senses and Weapon Familiarity, but these elves gain Run as a feat, in addition to a racial +2 to initiative. Handy. The Ifrit has a racial alternative that can help out as well. Wildfire Heart provides a +4 racial bonus to initiative, but it strips away the natural fire resistance that Ifrit receive. Tough choice. Feats There are not a lot of feats that deal with a character's Initiative, unfortunately. If there were then there would be a lot of players who always went first, regardless of what the rest of the party rolled. However, there are at least two feats those concerned with their standings in the initiative order should keep in mind.\nReally, do you take black over white? - Improved Initiative: The most common feat for those who want to go first, this feat gives the character a +4 bonus to all initiative checks (Core Rulebook 127). - Noble Scion: Your character is a member of a proud, noble family. If you select Scion of War then you may use your charisma modifier instead of your dexterity modifier to determine your initiative (The Inner Sea World Guide 288). Class Abilities This is where the numbers start to really perk up for characters looking to go before anyone else. A number of classes provide initiative bonuses at fairly early levels, and that should be taken into consideration.\nI'd do something quick, before it takes a deep breath. Gunslinger Well-known for being fast on the draw, gunslingers get a +2 to their initiative at level 3, as long as they have at least 1 point of grit remaining. Just to add insult to injury, if the gunslinger in question also has Quick Draw and empty hands then the character may draw a weapon as part of the initiative check. Just picture how fast that is. A particularly feared type of gunslinger is the Grand Marshal (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige). These law enforcement officers gain a number of abilities, but at second level they gain Danger Sense. Grand Marshals always act during the surprise round, and\u00a0gain 1/2 their level as an initiative bonus. Inquisitor No one knows the value of striking the first blow like the inquisitor. At second level these fanatics gain Cunning Initiative, adding their wisdom modifiers as a bonus to their initiatives.

These include his argument that reporters were too quick to question him on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Nobody is perfect, but the people that have served that put themselves out there and answered the call are my heroes,\" Kasich said.\n\n\"When you have another choice,\" he added, \"you just have to make a decision.\"\n\nKasich has returned to the Old Head as he pursues other political aspirations, from helping to organize Trump's HOPE event in Ohio over the weekend -- which he hosted alongside his wife -- to coming to West Virginia's mansion this weekend to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Joseph Kennedy's escape from Union prison at \"I Got Liverpool\" following the bombing at the Boston Marathon.\n\nHe says he returns to Ohio routinely \"because that's where I belong.\"\n\n\"Being elected governor has helped me and kept me in touch with how many votes I'm getting, or who's doing well in Ohio,\" he said.\n\nWhat kind of lawmaker?\n\n\nWhen Kasich ran for governor in 2002, he said, the expectations were even higher.\n\nAfter all, when he ran for governor in 2002, Kasich said, the expectations were even higher. John Kasich\n\n\"Because we had a college education, we had a lot of people who said we couldn't be governor,\" Kasich said during a 2000 presidential primary debate. \"I think the last major expectation was Republicans--men were supposed to", "human": "New York (CNN) It's just before 8 a.m., and John Kasich is in a crowded New York City green room.\n\nHe's waiting to go on \"CBS This Morning,\" and the room feels especially cramped at the moment because there are two minor entourages here. One is his, and another is for Spencer Rascoff, the CEO of online real estate company Zillow, who will also be a guest on the show. There's a curved teal couch and a coffee table with two Emmy Awards and the day's newspapers on it, all with front-page stories about the terrorist attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.\n\nKasich's here to talk about his new book, \" Two Paths: America Divided or United ,\" and the news of the day. There's President Donald Trump's proposed budget (it \"isn't going to pass,\" he says) and the opioid epidemic (Ohio's No. 3 for opioid deaths, according to a graphic on the screen, and drugs are \"destroying the culture of our country,\" he says), but he also wants to talk about Manchester. He has two 17-year-old daughters, twins and music fans, and just this past weekend he was at Rock on the Range, a three-day festival in Columbus, he says.\n\nKasich's a big concert-goer and he likes talking about music, something that came up every so often during the campaign. He recently went to a Maroon 5 concert with his wife and was surprised to realize just how many hits they have. He'll soon see fellow Ohioans, Twenty One Pilots, who went to Worthington Christian, the same school his daughters now go to, and who he was rooting for a year before they released a No. 1 album. In 2014, speaking about the musicians that the Ohio State Fair books, he said they need acts that are \"on the way up,\" according to the Columbus Dispatch. \"We ought to book Twenty One Pilots. My daughters love them; they're from here.\"\n\nKasich asks the assembled green room if they've heard of Tricky. Tricky's a British rapper in his late 40s, whose highest-charting song on the UK charts was a reworked version of \"Milk\" by the band Garbage that he was featured on. It peaked at No. 10 in 1996. Madonna once asked him to produce one of her albums, but he turned her down, he told the Guardian last year.\n\nTricky did a song with Hawkman, Kasich says, have you heard about Hawkman? What about Live? One of the guys from Live is on Tricky's \"Evolution Revolution.\" Doug, can you pull the song up. Doug, a member of Kasich's entourage, pulls out a phone and plays it.\n\nIn addition to music, Kasich also likes talking about jobs, especially whenever he has an audience with a job maker, such as the CEO of an online real estate company, as he does now. Does Zillow employ anyone in Ohio, he asks? \"Why not?\"\n\nA member of Rascoff's entourage reminds him they do; they bought a Cincinnati start-up back in 2015 called DotLoop that does online real estate document paperwork and had 124 employees. \"We need to have more of your people out there,\" Kasich says. \"You want to be in the Midwest.\"\n\nKasich pulls out his phone, a flip phone, and calls a guy named Wayne and hands the phone to Rascoff.\n\n\"We want to have something like Zillow in Ohio,\" Kasich says in the car after his CBS hit. \"It's consistent with what's happening in the state.\" If they have a job they need to fill, \"I will get it filled.\"\n\nSpeaking of jobs, Kasich has called his current gig -- being the governor of the great state of Ohio -- the second-best in the world, after president of the United States. The job of president, of course, he applied and was one of the finalists for -- the fourth-place Republican primary finisher -- but he ultimately wasn't hired. And the job of governor he won't be able to keep forever, because of term limits. In 20 months, he'll find himself unemployed.\n\nIt's an unusual time to be a Republican looking for work. In Washington, the party is in power, but weighed down by dysfunction and controversy. Trump's 2016 victory caught many by surprise, forcing politicians who assumed they'd have the option of running against a President Hillary Clinton in four years to reconsider their options. No one seems sure of what exactly to expect, with each new twist, turn, and congressional testimony bringing greater uncertainty.\n\nThe 2016 election caught many off-guard, including Republican politicians who assumed they'd have the option to run for president in four years, against Clinton.

{"eta": "Guns were an equalizer in the West and required when there was little order and little visible presence of the law given the size of the territories that had to be covered and the perceived impossibility of its carrying out. The gun, however, was arguably of second place in the language of the Declaration of Independence: \"our national policy is to secure the lives, liberty, and property of the people, by the force of arms.\" Of the two instruments as a whole, the shotgun or musket was judged as the more impressive.\n\nHenry Ford continued to utilize the machine gun as the key weapon of his war machine, which became the central element of a daily routine for the United States Army in the West. Ford's Military Repository at Eddystone, Ohio, preserves more than 1,000\" ten-pounder muskets of a type with a shoulder stock\" and many other weapons manufactured for and with the weapon of choice.\n\nTesla's last public meeting was on June 20, 1943. He sent a telegram from Hoegh-Nagy, stating that he loved and respected Tesla. Dr. Einstein went along with his visit, and Tesla's condition was excellent. He died a little after 11:00 p.m. that year.\n\nTesla was in good spirits, his voice contained no pain, and his eyes were as good as new. He told his contemporaries that the machine gun could restore peace. This assertion was echoed in the Army Staff Conference held during the investigation of Tesla's death.\n\nOn November 16, 1944, a general meeting took place at Fort Thaddeus, Colorado. The conference consists of a preliminary discussion of the civilian case and a meeting of the Office of Military Representative. The latter sends a report to the chief of the General Staff, detailing in a concise and factual manner, the purpose of the meeting.\n\nAs the reports themselves indicate, Tesla's claims were dismissed and accepted as likely and probable. Furthermore, no specific cause of death was disclosed: the justifications were that he died of complications caused by smoking or consumption of a stimulant.\n\nTesla's term of service as an officer of the Army (not to mention his efforts in the field) in the First World War meant he was only served for the duration of the war. In May 1947, the Bureau of Public Information of the Department of Defense issued the following statement of the views of the United States:\n\n\"During the war years, there were many scientists that cooperated in the actual development of telephones, microphones, and the like. These men and their creations did more and more interesting work in America, not only during their military time, but during the peace years as well. Tesla was one of them. He also maintained close contact with radio stations around the world. Considering that they were working to provide communication with people in different countries, their views and work should be considered in the larger picture.\"\n\nTesla's name in U.S. history will remain marked for the rest of his lifetime. Our admiration for him has touched us all and lives on to this day.\n\nNumerous requests went out to the Department of Defense about Tesla, and what we were able to obtain from those available was uncooperative. But thanks to Dr. Fritz Neuweiler's discovery, a California State agency was called on to explore with Tesla the possibilities for his personal records. That agency was the Aeronautical Records Research Foundation. We were told that of Tesla's official records, there was only a little time between July 1, 1936 to the end of World War II, before the Civil Aeronautics Board (Cabrini-Green) were forced to part with them in 1948 by the federal government due to their abundance of CO 2 and toxic waste.\n\nThe machine gun in front of Tesla's throne\n\nIn September, 1944, a private team of Mr. Tim Moorhead and Mr. Martin R.R. Dowling travelled to Ft. Thaddeus at the U.S. Army Quartermaster Depot. They were not happy. Tesla resided in a small house with no security, no system of mail, mail delivery or service, no privacy.\n\nThe men were told to stop by where Tesla was the most comfortable, and Musk told them,\n\n\"The guards are inside and the door is propped open for you.\"\n\nWe returned the next day to Ft. Thaddeus with Mr. Martin and Mr. Moorhead. Tesla was far into a 4-room wooden dwelling from there. Tesla lived in bed with a medical man and few pets. He had no bath, nothing to use on the stove, and so little privacy. Musk recalled his amazement, \"We stopped by the front door and had an interesting conversation. We asked Tesla why his home wasn't as small as you have in the town.\"\n\nThe man told us that Tesla kept the cellar door locked at all times, and locked a window at the same time. He told us that Tesla", "topp": "Guns were an equalizer in the West and required when there was little order and little visible presence of the law given the size of the territories that had to be covered and the relative paucity of armed clubs and rifle-toting militiamen. Without which, anyone who suspected his own right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is charged in the storm of bullets raining down from higher than helicopters.\n\nThe guns, dropped after more than a month of heavy use and wild speculation, proved the hangman's rope for an administration that gave up on a radical change in the organization for the sake of quick relief in Chicago. Many people were convinced they had no choice but to let people disarm. But in a state almost as constricted as the Midwest, they had no choice but to shoot indiscriminately.\n\nInstead of a single state of emergency, the Chicago standoff was rapidly diverted into a coordinated scenario designed by the army brass for the assembled television cameras. As Chicago PD commissioner Lester Mays later said, \"We thought the most a policeman could do was make life as miserable as possible.\" Men armed with AK-47s, they shot every man who approached a car but didn't commit any acts of violence, then let it go without further scuffles.\n\nThis method eliminated the lethal use of a couple of dozen cops in a fenced area where a single block-mall cop in a truck would have been mowed down in seconds. The Chicago show was over before it really began.\n\nDespite what we are told by anti-gun leaders, we couldn't have accomplished this without safe of reason \u2013 guns, not bullets. There was no question that Paul Vallely, the only former Chicago cop who a jury found unfit for duty, had violated no law. He is still considered a hero to many of the men he tried to protect \u2013 there is a new gun control activist group dedicated to defaming his name, to destroying his fame and to watching him living in squalor as a made man on the edge of the law.\n\nWe wanted to know if anyone had to die to end a drastic failure of law enforcement in a small town of 47,000. The Mayor and Police Chief of Cleveland, Art Vergara, were both successful in keeping their head after they were fired after the revelation of the shooting of officers Rodney King and Charles Manson. As a group, they were all tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Since their brother in law, Fraternal Order of Police leader Jim Hanen, a hero to hundreds of men as a strong father, just escaped a prison term after pleading guilty to running a ring of doctors involved in extortion, it is no wonder they would prefer to go down with a sinking ship instead of face their first trial to answer to civilian charges and a sentence they surely didn't ask for.\n\nIt would be a lie to say that Johnny Martelle did not deserve to be beaten to death, as was repeatedly hinted at with all the violence by the police \u2013 that he acted accidentally, irresponsibly, or foolishly on the cops receiving no sympathy from the jury or the mayor. Martelle had sought to the change of the police ways \u2013 changing the model of the police force while espousing a free-enterprise, individualistic philosophy espoused by most Chicagoans. His attempts were to be seen as he moved within the organization structure, from Captain, to Police Commander, to Captain \u2013 that is, the chief, not chief instructor.\n\nThe trial and conviction of the officers drew national attention to violence against people of color \u2013 those who bore the brunt of these methods. It is a powerful symbol of how every lie, regardless of how advanced the awareness and sympathy, can be allowed to overshadow truth. For little more than an hour, the police put on a show for the United States; a place so small that most Americans knew it was just an island. It is a stop on the true path toward peace and prosperity for a nation of expansionist, rapacious, war-mongering, inwardly-directed, out-of-control bureaucrats.\n\nMany cities around the world have suffered in the last year as they look for stronger police, stricter civilian oversight, fair judge selection and better police-criminal relationship. This progress never happens without the sacrifices of an open, informed citizenry as in Chicago, without the men and women who put their lives on the line to prevent more violence and death in the streets.\n\nMuch has happened since the March 12 trial, but fundamentally the same approach toward citizens as always remained. The only difference was the legislation that would curb their ability to defend themselves. With nearly every officer as a tinderbox waiting to ignite in a moment of convenience to justify more violent seizures, the sanctuary city and line-mall legislation failed to provide safety to the law-abiding and the citizens of a former gold rush town called Chicago.", "human": "Guns were an equalizer in the West and required when there was little order and little visible presence of the law given the size of the territories that had to be covered and the lack of officers to handle it. Throw in the fact that in many counties and municipalities lawmen were in the pockets of the rich and powerful who owned land\u2014and lots of it\u2014and you've got some very good reasons why men walked around \"well heeled.\" The Johnson County War (Wyoming) and the Lincoln County War (New Mexico) are just two examples of violence spurred by lawmen that were the arm of a faction that wanted to retain power at any price.\n\nSo it is somewhat surprising to realize that many counties and towns in the West during the late 1800's had stiffer gun control laws then they do in the modern era. But as western towns attracted more families, business men, and industries, the townspeople could no longer tolerate the \"wild cowboys\" that were part of area ranch and cattle drives. These were generally young men in their twenties, liquored up, testosterone driven, and with the judgment of a cow on loco weed.\n\nTake some of the roughest towns in the old West:\n\nFort Worth, Texas, had its share of vice in the form of gambling, drinking, and loose women in an area known as Hell's Half-Acre. Prostitution and gambling attracted such notable characters as Wyatt, James and Virgil Earp, Billy Thompson, Timothy Courtright (who served as sheriff in between bouts of criminality), Luke Short (gambling proprietor), Charlie Wright and other high profile gamblers and gunslingers. By 1887, after three notorious killings, including that of Timothy Courtright by Luke Short, the citizens of Fort Worth voted in reformers as mayor and sheriff, and thus began the \"cleaning up\" of Fort Worth. Gambling was now to take place in private rooms, saloons were to close on Sundays, and there would be a ban on carrying guns in the city. Even the police officers were to replace their pistols with clubs or nightsticks. Needless to say, the reformers got their share of flack from the \"business\" interests of the town, but, by the turn of the century, all these reforms were being enforced.\n\nDodge City, Kansas was a \"wide-open\" town in the 1870s and 1880s and earned its reputation as a Sodom of the plains. Some of the most famous gunfighters in America's history were officers of the law in Dodge including Wyatt Earp, Morgan Earp, Bat Masterson, and Edward Masterson. The \"peace officers\" of Dodge often had gambling and saloon interests and mingled with or counted as friends the likes of Ben Thompson, Bill Tilghman, and, our Fort Worth friend, Luke Short, among other infamous characters. As early as 1876, Dodge City had a ban on carrying guns on the north side of town (the south side remained wide open), a ban that was rarely enforced. However, by 1883 the death toll from gun play had risen sufficiently for the town fathers to enact a stricter ban. Ordinance No. 67 enacted August 14th 1882 specified that no one could \"carry concealed or otherwise about his or her person, any pistol, bowie knife, slung shot or other dangerous or deadly weapons, except County, City, or United Sates Officers\" and raised the fine from twenty-five dollars to one hundred dollars, no small amount in 1882. The Dodge City Times declared: \"There is a disposition to do away with the carrying of firearms, and we hope the feeling will become general. The carrying of firearms is a barbarous custom, and it's time the practice was broken up.\"\n\nAnd then there was the famous shoot out at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona due to efforts at gun control. After silver was discovered in the mountains surrounding Tombstone in 1879, the town grew from a population of 100 to an astounding 7000 people by 1882. The mining wealth attracted businessmen and their families and with them came a more Victorian era sensibility which clashed with the usual residents of boomtowns: gamblers, brothel owners, miners, and area ranch hands. The Earps arrived in the early days of December 1879, Virgil Earp having recently been named a Deputy U.S. Marshall. In 1881 the town council passed an ordinance prohibiting the carrying of weapons in the town limits:\n\nOrdinance No. 9\n\n\"To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons\" (effective April 19, 1881).\n\nSection 1: \"It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any person to carry deadly weapons, concealed or otherwise [except the same be carried openly in sight, and in the hand] within the limits of the City of Tombstone.\n\nSection 2: This prohibition does not extend to persons immediately leaving or entering the", "eta_suffix": " little privacy.

{"eta": "Halliburton woke up Friday, determined to debunk a film by Robert Greenwald that it has not seen. You have to wonder just what Halliburton's CEO and department of government wanted to see.\n\n\nThat was Friday afternoon, after thousands of gallons of oil spilled in Mabry, Tennessee. Then, as is the case with all spill incidents, the investigation revealed a black hole of concealment. A three-month long bureaucratic stonewalling with the public. And oil is oil.\n\n\nGreenwald reported to the latest 300 member Fossil Free Tennessee chapter Wednesday afternoon. The DVD is laced with mischaracterizations, lies and far-fetched claims. \"It's a very boring movie,\" Greenbaum said, regarding his latest movie. \"And we're the ones who are supposed to do the boring. We're the ones who are the ones with the expertise and the honesty to do the boring.\"\n\n\nFossil Free Tennessee, run by people with a target on their backs as they did in the earlier case in Mabry, Tennessee, didn't respond to calls for comment sent through the media for weeks. At least five citizens approached Freedom Oklahoma, a free-speech group representing the state of Oklahoma, and said we should call the woman and director of the documentary, Jake Long of Republic Film. \"We don't discuss the individuals' identities,\" said Patti Gilmore, of Free Oklahoma's publicity department.\n\n\nThursday, we did. In the last five weeks, a state agency and a local government claimed to know nothing about the oil spill. Meanwhile, a generation of the citizens the state and the local government have failed are suing the state and the local government for more than $250 million.\n\n\nBogus information\n\n\nAs Greenwald observed in The Washington Post, the Mabry incident went unreported in the mainstream media. But it's all known from the \"greenwood network\" \u2013 covering law enforcement \u2013 the depth of which can't be overstated. An \"extreme\" crime, if that's the word. A five-month long legal case? \"No matter the cost to the taxpayer, the case has been virtually forgotten,\" Long said. \"And the only reason we're in this position is because we got subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee looking into the national security implications of our work.\"\n\n\nNonsense. The Investigative Project on Terrorism and Freedom of Information of Congress have already dug deep into the gross misrepresentations, disinformation and lies the film has been fed.\n\n\nThe Einhorn brothers make their initial film appearance at the time the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. Some time later, the brothers visited the Mabry oil spill site and treated six patients. According to Einhorn, at least one of the patients has tested positive for asbestos, a known carcinogen.\n\n\nOf course, just because it happens in the movies doesn't mean it counts, or that it's factually accurate, or even relevant for the average citizen. In fact, it gives the government and the corporate media a reason to withhold the truth \u2013 because it exposes the case for what it is: an attack on democracy.\n\n\nThe FDA disregards food labels, so GMO food can be sold without labels. The Department of Labor tried to ban the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. The Department of Health and Human Services suppressed the television show Critical Care, which exposed such corruption. Who could forget the wasteful government subsidies of subsidies to solar and windpower companies?\n\n\nIn a time when the federal government spends more money on advertising and promotional groups than it does on basic social services, it's difficult to believe that a movie with such a bleak message and profanity-laced language would hold much sway.\n\n\nSo, we do what we can to ensure the film can get viewed. We post it on YouTube, gather a coalition of 300 citizens to push for the DVD's release and collect donations so a modest advertising campaign can make it to the screen.\n\n\nSo where does it stop? The film has to play in some garages, where it's easier to be watched. But where would a citizen or average person go if it wasn't there? There are hundreds of places from the modest to the aforementioned, and each one requires a different way of viewing it. The only way to find out what's wrong with the film is to find it, because no one is telling you the truth.\n\n\n\"What's happening here is egregious, criminal behavior,\" Long said. He hopes the DVD, despite being made of lies, helps bring accountability for the people who perpetrated the crime. The public should know that corruption in the public sector, big oil or environmental, has been the norm for generations of the government. In many cases, the government, and many within the environment, are nothing more than agents of the corporate system.\n\n\nThe next time you're in a room, at a dinner party or when the sole person in the room is doing their best to put on a good show for you", "topp": "Halliburton woke up Friday, determined to debunk a film by Robert Greenwald that it has not seen. You have to wonder just what Halliburton's CEO and department of defense secretary is working on \u2013 specifically what is making John Kelly not the world's smartest man and now tweeting on his official accounts with his 2-year-old son checking on him. More than a little suspicious.\n\nGreenwald caught up with Doug Halliburton (the company's chief executive) in the morning to meet with him again before going to hang out at his guesthouse for round of golf.\n\nWhile around the 1:00 hour mark we hear quite a bit of material related to the video, it got rather impeded during our video discussion of what people could do with their time. So we will be going over a few of the highlights of the meeting ahead of time. But first we end with some info we haven't discussed yet that will be very interesting to the Trump cabal. Read on.\n\nMeanwhile, sure enough there is a flash of Cruz jetliner footage from the morning of 6/28, sans Robert Greenwald, but we won't dig it out here unless we're asked to.\n\nThe intervening episode begins around 3:00 minute mark for the usual Bush car chase footage from Atlanta, Bill and Hillary's changing apparitions and then the video of Brian Kelly's trip from the United States to Vietnam. That part follows at roughly 2:20 (13:21 to be exact), with the entire conversation between Bob Gibbons and I following at around 1:30 minute mark.\n\nThe footage of the Univision team boarding a ferry from Maryland to Puerto Rico was actually shot when I took a week off. They were watching a couple of the original Univision events, including also taking a brief review of the Buffalo Bills game. But as those were a virtual washout, they didn't need to point us to the source, but a van for their government contractor DRS was parked by the side of the road a few miles up the road. It was their pleasure to drive us up there and pick it up for an interview with Michael Chivvis, but we had to keep the information clear.\n\nThe footage of the Obama jetliner as it carried President Bush to Dayton Ohio from Atlanta in the early morning of 9/11 seems, at times, reminiscent of what was before that day. They could have done this some time before the trial for 9/11. Maybe they have a good reason.\n\nLater, Robert Gibbons opened a brief discussion with Marc Johnson about the incident that took place on the USS Tyler. Later, after a discussion of TSA pre-vetting groups, he pointed out, \"obviously we are de-regulated, we're able to fly without having to go through it.\" He further referred to them as \"terrorist organizations.\" Well, mmmm, WTF?\n\nIn case you missed it, Gibbons also posed some interesting questions, \"How can you prove, or have any authority at all, to detain someone without a single exculpatory document? How can you prove that it was terrorist attack or not terrorist attack? How do you know what a terrorist is and what not a terrorist is?\" It seems Gibbons could be revealing information that he can't get to in real life. It is fascinating to wonder what the tenor of his experiences on MH17 could be when it is all said and done.\n\nIn between rounds of golf, Geoff Dyer (another CEO of Halliburton's, Ty Coates is a VP who created the entity supporting Donald Trump) and we learned that he and the PM of India were working on a \u00a342.5 billion deal in Mumbai called the DMIC Logistics Hub at which BMTC would be the prime contractor. Well, first of all, why would anyone want to close the DMIC facility? Now, obviously the former premier and the PM of India don't like each other, but they might be too blinkered to understand that even if it did want to visit the DMIC facility, on the whole, most new contracts go to Indian companies. Maybe it was through the briber's meters at central processing point there that it was decided to let multiple Indian companies bid.\n\nAlso out of the Dutch [Dutch translation: Saudi, since Anne Frank was Dutch] interview with Geoff Dyer, in which he expressed a desire for more \"green,\" he praised him for the combination of reliability of Halliburton products with the company's expertise in everything from hydrocarbons to pipelines. Dyer told us that the results at home are in line with his expectations.\n\nAfter a meeting with a secretary of defense-controlled agency (DRS), there were a few more video segments from the briefing. 1:36 looks like a prop from Eternally Problematic, but it looks like it's the former secretary's cabin from the trailer. Geoff also enjoyed, although seems to be tongue in cheek, pointing out the toll toll booths", "human": "Halliburton woke up Friday, determined to debunk a film by Robert Greenwald that it has not seen. You have to wonder just what Halliburton's CEO and department of agitation and propaganda are thinking. The reaction to Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers is similar to CEO David Lesar's ads in which he says that Halliburton is doing a great job in Iraq: Both are without first hand knowledge, based on fantasy and hearsay.\n\nIt's worth pausing to recall the insidious nature of Halliburton's role in the invasion and occupation of Iraq. As with so much related to the Bush/Cheney Administration, the truth is stranger than fiction. We did not need Oliver Stone for this one; Robert Greenwald's fact-based documentary tells it better than any novelist could imagine.\n\nWe all by now know that Dick Cheney retired from the Pentagon in 1993 to accede to the throne of Halliburton, an oil field services company based in Houston. Under Mr. Cheney's reign, Halliburton acquired Dresser Industries which included the Kellogg Company (the K of KBR), a major engineering firm. True to form, Mr. Cheney's acquisition did not include much due diligence. After Mr. Cheney left Halliburton with tens of millions of dollars in his pocket largely earned because of his connections to Middle East dictators, Halliburton had to cough up $2.3 billion in cash, about $1.2 billion in stock and another $55 million in IOUs to help pay off the tens of thousands of people in this country who had suffered and/or died of asbestos poisoning at the hand of Dresser, which Mr. Cheney had acquired and for which Mr. Cheney was (and apparently still is) handsomely compensated. If this sounds a bit like Mr. Cheney's due diligence with respect to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it should. He never bothered to look at what Dresser had before he bought it for Halliburton and he never bothered to look at what Iraq had before he broke it for the U.S.\n\nAs Messrs. Cheney and Rumsfeld planned the war in Iraq beginning during the first year of the Bush Administration, Mr. Cheney's Halliburton was the contractor of choice to do the work that the military had always done in past wars. This time, though, the war would be privatized to suit the ideology and obfuscation of the Bush team, which wanted to pretend that the number of people we'd need in Iraq would be small (so outsource it) and that the government can be privatized (so outsource it to friends).\n\nThe Iraq debacle is now the subject of at least a half a dozen books, including the terrific Fiasco, by Tom Ricks. Until very recently, however, there has been relatively little penetration into the popular psyche of the role played by Halliburton/KBR in particular and other private military contractors in general, such as Blackwater (runs a private army in Iraq), Titan and CACI (provided translation and interrogation services for places such as the Abu Ghraib prison and both still provide key services to the US military in Iraq and elsewhere).\n\nThe reason is simple: the Bush Administration and its Congressional foot soldiers ranging from George Allen and John Warner of Virginia to Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania have refused at every turn to allow for any oversight at all, even though Democratic Senators have asked for such bi-partisan review for years. Unlike their Republican friends, Democrats recall the historic role that Harry Truman played in conducting such oversight during World War II, uncovering $160 billion (in today's dollars) of waste, fraud, abuse and profiteering. I suppose Congress in World War II did not take bribes. Halliburton learned the lesson and this time has gotten its money's worth, having paid over $2 million in campaign contributions to Republicans as hush money to keep the terms of the contracts, and the human destruction those contracts have wrought, all locked up.\n\nEven in Bush's America, where journalists often fear to write and careers end for truths told, the facts eventually speak for themselves. Friday, CBS News and Bloomberg broke the story of a lawsuit by families and survivors of the so-called Friday Massacre in Iraq, in which seven Halliburton/KBR truck drivers were brutally murdered because Halliburton/KBR insisted on sending a convoy of oil tankers out on roads that the US military had closed to all traffic due to extraordinarily high risk. But you gotta make a buck, so Halliburton sent the trucks out. Men died. And more hatred between US and locals ensued, further destabilizing the mess that is Iraq.\n\nIraq for Sale tells the story of that gruesome ride for profits, probably the most egregious example of out right war profiteering that we have yet seen in a killing field where the likes of Halliburton/KBR reap money with men's lives.

{"eta": "Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and Men\n\nAn NIJ-funded study shows that American Indian and Alaska Native women and men suffer violence at alarmingly high rates, ranging from 36.2 to 53.1 percent. And even more staggering, 22 percent of all women and 26 percent of all men in the United States are victims of spousal violence, as are 14 percent of all Native American men. Some of us, along with some female relatives, are arrested but not prosecuted for acts of violence. I lost a wife to domestic violence and am very concerned with the prevalence of domestic violence on every level. We were formerly known as \"strangers\" in my nation of Bolivia and have found it very difficult to be accepted as leaders.\n\n\"These issues are not generally dealt with by the criminal justice system,\" says Raymond Akindayi, project coordinator at the TransGrowth Network, the largest Native-run advocacy group in the country. \"Femicides, homicide, domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, domestic violence, and sexual assault are committed often, often on Native women by non-Native men.\"\n\nChances are that if you're a white woman getting mugged by a man who had your money, phone, and credit cards, or you're a Native woman getting mugged by an invisible stranger who stalked your home, you will not be charged\u2014provided of course that you're fortunate enough to be able to walk away\u2014but you will be wrongfully incarcerated for your own life. And you will be convicted.\n\nIt does not have to be this way. Native women in the United States are reporting that, on average, they are five times more likely to be killed if they are raped by a stranger than if they're raped by a partner.\n\nAlaska Native women are telling similar stories, but few of them get at the rate or detail that's required to make a reality show out of it.\n\nThe reason is a lack of government accountability, a strong disincentive to reporting crimes, and the complex failure in the criminal justice system to consider a woman's narrative of how, and what, we live and what we are worth. For example, it wasn't until 2010 that the Internal Revenue Service began enforcing the tax law that came into existence in 1975: \u00a7668(b).\n\nThe law makes it much more difficult for someone to claim under the IRS that they were raped because the fact must \"be mentioned on the tax return.\" And it makes it much more difficult for him to claim that he was a victim of sexual assault or stalking based on the fact that he was raped. Even within the AP Stylebook, there is only a page or two dedicated to the legitimate idea that rape is violence against a woman: \"sexual assault, rape, forcible sodomy\"\u2014that's rape if someone has sex with you, but that's not rape if someone forces you to have sex; that's rape if a woman has sex but nobody forced her, or if a woman is forced but someone does not.\n\n\"We need to put a real spotlight on non-consensual sex, rape, and spousal violence, especially among Native women and girls, to move on,\" says Akindayi. \"More stories like this are the reason why we need this awareness campaign.\"\n\nThe global movement for gender equality has taken a step forward in combating spousal violence. Last year's Durban conference of Global Feminist Organizations was an absolute reminder that while we have the ability to make a difference in the lives of women and children in every country, we cannot stop there. That's why I co-founded the Global Fund to End Violence Against Women.\n\nThe International Fund is working in 23 countries to provide more than $500 million annually to support research about violence against women. In some countries, such as India and Pakistan, anti-domestic violence work is funded by the states\u2014although we are currently working with a U.N. goal, we still believe that some governments have a role to play in fighting such violence.\n\nThe successful international campaign to end spousal violence is also about structural change. We are seeing the federal government transition from funding of programs that help women at risk\u2014programs and services specifically aimed at helping those women stay safe\u2014to funding specific programs to help women stay safe when they are at their most vulnerable, called the PACE model. This strategy emphasizes and expands access to domestic violence prevention programs, domestic and sexual violence shelters, and trauma centers. As a result, we are seeing a drop in the number of Native women who end up in jail for spousal violence.\n\nAt last year's Durban conference of the international group of anti-domestic violence organizations, Durban University's Aimee Lloyd, co-chairwoman of Durban's Global Action Alliance Against Violence Against Women, said it best:\n\nSpousal violence is a crime; it is a tragedy. But we have a", "topp": "Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and Men\n\nAn NIJ-funded study shows that American Indian and Alaska Native women and men suffer violence at alarmingly high rates, particularly in situations of domestic violence, physical assault and sexual assault, suicide, self-injury, and attempted suicide.\n\nStatistics\n\nThere were an estimated 35,919 reported incidents of violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women and men in 2009, an average of 167 and 182 per year. Of the victims, 16.7 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women and men reported being physically assaulted (in addition to \"deprived of health services,\" which includes alcohol- and drug-related violence and self-injury), which resulted in injury.\n\nAlmost 40 percent of the American Indian and Alaska Native women and men who died in 2009 were killed by their intimate partners. In addition, a large number of American Indian and Alaska Native women were assaulted with blunt objects. In a study of Indian-specific media, Indian Country Today found that violence was exposed by teachers, students, and parents in 84 percent of cases of verbal violence among American Indian and Alaska Native students. Another study found that when a school does not respond to abuse, American Indian and Alaska Native children in Oklahoma City and St. Anthony, Oklahoma, were four times more likely to be beaten to death by schoolmates than other children.\n\nAlso, in lieu of coaching, a high-school coach molested Indian kids in India, Latin America, the Pacific Islands, and Puerto Rico (New World Academies Technical College in Puerto Rico). A study found that children not served with love (women of mixed race) in Pennsylvania were 65 percent more likely to die of breast cancer than kids served with love (a majority White, Black, and Mexican Americans) in Texas.\n\nIndigenous Women and Girls\n\nNearly one in three Indigenous women in the United States were raped in their lifetimes. Murders of indigenous women doubled during the period from 1970-2004. In November of 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Native American \"ex-wives\" were now citizens and entitled to due process under the 14th amendment. However, in Oklahoma, four murdered Native women remain uncounted. In June of 2008, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported, the highest rates of death in child abuse in 20 years.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has reported that 9.8 percent of all federal prisoners held in 2006 were Indigenous. Despite the growing rate of incarceration, 30 percent of federal prisoners had a Native background. Indigenous Women and Girls are at a particularly high risk of domestic violence. Forty-three percent of women in mixed-race relationships had experienced physical or sexual violence in their marriage. When discussing women of color and domestic violence in American Indian communities, American Indian Women are mentioned commonly. \"Mardi Gras Survivor: The Spirit of All That Served\" by Betty Jacquez describes Navajo soldiers who were awarded the Medal of Honor for killing an enemy soldier on the battlefield. Similar to other Native women, Micronesian and Amerindian women were not depicted in films, and films never depicted indigenous children who killed themselves after violence.\n\nIndigenous Women in Politics\n\nIn the 2009 legislative session, 48 Native women representing 435 House districts were elected. Native women represented 76 percent of Democratic positions; 74 percent were women of color, representing 40 percent of Democrats.\n\nA 2009 study found that Native women represented 40 percent of Congressional meeting participants in the US House, 36 percent of Youth Council/Christian Priest roles in the US Senate, 29 percent of FED Appreciation Committee members, 32 percent of Stewards and Conservation Services subcommittee representatives in the US House, 50 percent of Archaeological Resources Subcommittee members, 29 percent of Rappahannock and Pitt Research Group members in the Senate, and 99 percent of Subcommittee Leadership roles in the US Senate.\n\nIn September of 2009, Congress enacted the Native American Indian and Alaska Native Political Participation Act, which expedited the redistricting process for the Indian Population Group, or U.S. Indian population. The redistricting process would begin in 2014.\n\nIn the US Congress, 132 Native and Other women representing 40 percent of seats were elected in 2008. While Indian Affairs looked to greater representation for Native women, American Indian and Alaska Native women's voices were underrepresented on the Washington, DC House of Representatives from 2000-2008. In 2008, 132 Native American and other women representing 54 percent of House seats were elected. Additionally, 338 Native American women representing 75 percent of the seats were elected in 2006. Ten years later, 26 Native women represent 37 percent of the seats (by comparison, 26 Native women in the US Senate represent 51 percent of seats).\n\nIndian Aging\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Vital Statistics, Indian men and women 75 and older are twice as likely to live alone as American Indian women and men.\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native women, minorities and other elderly individuals are less able", "human": "Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and Men\n\nAn NIJ-funded study shows that American Indian and Alaska Native women and men suffer violence at alarmingly high rates.\n\nMore than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native women and men have experienced violence in their lifetime, and more than one in three experienced violence in the past year, according to a new report from an NIJ-funded study.\n\nThe study, part of NIJ's research program on violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women, looked at how prevalent psychological aggression and physical violence by intimate partners, stalking, and sexual violence were among American Indian and Alaska Native women and men. It also examined the perpetrators' race and the impact of the violence.\n\nSee \"Examining Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women.\"\n\nThe study used a nationally representative sample from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS),[1] with a total of 2,473 adult women and 1,505 adult men who identified themselves as American Indian or Alaska Native, either alone or in combination with another racial group. Most women (83 percent) and most men (79 percent) were affiliated or enrolled with a tribe or village. More than half of women and men (54 percent for each group) had lived within reservation boundaries or in an Alaska Native village in the past year.\n\nThe results, which show high rates of violence against both women and men, provide the most thorough assessment on the extent of violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women and men to date. These results complement those from the National Crime Victimization Survey. Prior to this project, there were few estimates available, and often these estimates were based on local samples.[2] The few national estimates available used very small samples, which did not always accurately represent the American Indian and Alaska Native population in the United States.[3]\n\nSee \"Differences Between Two National Surveys.\"\n\nViolence Against Women\n\nResults show that more than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native women (84.3 percent) have experienced violence in their lifetime (see Table 1). This includes 56.1 percent who have experienced sexual violence, 55.5 percent who have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner, 48.8 percent who have experienced stalking, and 66.4 percent who have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Overall, more than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime.\n\nTable 1.

This includes 14.4 percent who have experienced sexual violence, 8.6 percent who have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner, 11.6 percent who have experienced stalking, and 25.5 percent who have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Overall, more than 730,000 American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in the past year.\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native women are 1.2 times as likely as non-Hispanic white-only[4] women to have experienced violence in their lifetime and 1.7 times as likely to have experienced violence in the past year. They are also significantly more likely to have experienced stalking and physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime, as well as psychological aggression by an intimate partner both in their lifetime and in the past year.\n\nViolence Against Men\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native men also have high victimization rates. More than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native men (81.6 percent) have experienced violence in their lifetime (see Table 2). This includes 27.5 percent who have experienced sexual violence, 43.2 percent who have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner, 18.6 percent who have experienced stalking, and 73 percent who have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner.

{"eta": "Puerto Ricans like to say that politics is the national sport, and who could argue with that? With a participation rate hovering near 80% and campaigning that features elaborate political shtick in every town square, the word seems to have penetrated the consciousness of the public too. The feds' political attempt to remove Pueblo Mayor Rosales from office in order to create what officials refer to as \"executive power\" was met with a strong rebuke from elected officials and the citizens themselves. The right-wing government-backed candidate prevailed in the 2014 municipal elections, and now a majority of Puebloans voted for him when he won the vote in the municipal primary elections in May.\n\nThe crazy thing about the Pueblo bid is that Rosales couldn't even win a single precinct. The Tea Party-backed candidate received less than one percent of the vote in Pueblo, a small city a mere 600 miles from the border and four-tenths of a mile from a virtual border. And Rosales has been challenged in the past for his experiences in politics. His opponent, former City Councilwoman Marion Grau Rodriguez, received little support from the Tea Partiers, while Democrats went to the polls in droves. Rosales may get his moment in the proverbial sun, but his personal career has not yet even begun to take flight.\n\nPueblo is not a liberal paradise, not even close to being the kind of politically liberal enclave that California's San Gabriel Valley is commonly known for. The city has a progressive reputation \u2013 as a local author once said, the city is the model of an Arkansas experiment in Republicanism. But that's just because the town is a rural outpost with a small Republican population, and has long been thought to be teeming with moderate-sized government workers.\n\nIt's been argued that Pueblo is the perfect illustration of this suburban conservative split because it's a small town that is heavily subsidized. Pueblo's public universities and libraries alone provide nearly a quarter of all residents with free education. Residents also get free or reduced-price grocery vouchers, university football tickets, discounted movie tickets, and more. A population of just 400,000 means that Pueblo is a prime test case for a mostly separate town without major transportation or other municipal services. So is the disconnect real? Is Pueblo really the model for conservatives to follow in California?\n\nAccording to first hand reports \u2013 and TV reports \u2013 when it comes to cronyism and wasteful spending, small government is not a conservative value. A majority of Pueblo's voters say that they don't like politicians who spend more money than they generate in taxes. Though there is almost certainly some truth to that notion (more so in rural settings), it is doubtful that it's caused by a desire to help each other, or that residents would want political change if in the long run it prevented them from getting an even better deal.\n\nPueblo voters overwhelmingly don't think they need to petition for more school property tax dollars. Public transportation is widely liked, with even more officials and workers feeling comfortable using transit. Democratic political leadership in the town certainly has generated plenty of funding for more infrastructure and education since the 2009 recession began, and after 20 years, some small concerns have been addressed. The gap between the land-value tax paid by most homeowners in Pueblo versus the amount collected by Pueblo's two largest public-service institutions remains the largest in the state, with most the state's largest city, the Los Angeles-Long Beach, matching the middle. It's fair to say that the capital city's schools have made all the difference in keeping this small town on a higher moral ground.\n\nAnd let's be honest \u2013 even if residents were making it more difficult to live their lives \u2013 the farther you stray from the blue state, the worse your experience with large groups of power-hopping politicians and special interest groups becomes. Puebloans care deeply about their public service, and see those institutions not just as symbols of civic virtue, but as critical to Pueblo's tradition of public servant service. In the 1950s and 1960s, elected municipal officials used to be accustomed to making office calls from their district offices, or even home. But increasingly residents want to be there. Some small towns across the state recently joined Pueblo in joining them, and more and more agree that the best way to benefit from that venture is to organize around their local elected officials.\n\nThis situation has proven to be highly effective in a single community, and one that is familiar as well with the needs of its citizens. Pueblo residents see those in the greater metro Los Angeles region and in other parts of California as dictating their destiny, and they have the clout to push back \u2013 just as citizens did to stop the massive transfer of state government land to Los Angeles in the 1980s.

With a participation rate hovering near 80% and campaigning that features elaborate, flashy \"issue\" ads that sneakily record who has the best views of the latest swooping political ad, the standoff between five bodies that hold the purse strings, money in politics and the integrity of the electoral process is growing more elemental than ever.\n\nSome political pundits have argued that the direct relationship between votes and governance in Puerto Rico is stunted. Others have derided the Puerto Rican electoral system, noting that 15 percent of Puerto Rico's electorate \u2014 more than a third of its eligible voters \u2014 are eligible, but choose not to vote. Both of these accounts would argue that re-enfranchising people who do not vote will imperil the process, even if they also refer to a system that is known to inflict long waits and arduous registration processes as a form of harassment that makes it harder to exercise the democratic right to vote. This perspective leads to the incorrect premise that \"no one was voting\" in the U.S., as if 15 percent of eligible people were not eligible to vote.\n\nThere are two main questions that must be addressed if we are to understand the causes and outcomes of, and solutions to, the issues of electoral participation and party proliferation in Puerto Rico. First, the geographic composition and proportion of Puerto Rican electorate. In the 2013 census the survey respondents were presented with the following list of choices: \"Living in the United States, or United States of America.\" It was then asked, \"In your choice of type of country: Puerto Rico, Other (U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam), or Undecided.\" Based on the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 2010 research on Puerto Rican population structure, all respondents indicated they voted in the 2002 and 2004 general elections. Approximately 14.3 percent of voters reported voting in the 2005 and 2006 general elections, but only 5.9 percent voted in the 2008 presidential primary. The 2010 census did not include identifiers for those who registered prior to the 2000 general election. These figures undoubtedly exclude those who remain unaffiliated because of past voting, a lack of political experience, or an attempt to register for the first time, given that in 2004 votes in some elections became invalid based on unaffiliated status. However, such a figure\u2014many more votes than now registered\u2014is certainly indicative of the demographics and composition of the electorate in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe other question is about the relative size of each population group, and whether all voters are treated equally, and hence, whether all groups of voters are acknowledged for participating in the electoral process. One must wonder how significant these differences are relative to the challenges that Puerto Rico faces in maintaining its democracy. Another worry of some electoral engagement experts is the potential impact of voter turnout on the electoral process by contributing to public assistance and charity bureaus. Clearly, while civil society organizations at a mass level are aware of the impact that turnout has on the voter base, have the resources to effectively communicate campaign messaging, and are able to incorporate know-how about voter engagement with their work, the increased fundraising and support required to fund low-turnout elections reinforces the myth that\u2014but are not guaranteed\u2014the political process is fair.\n\nConversely, proponents of Puerto Rican electoral engagement argue that in order to address voter apathy, anti-voter turnout tactics should be increasingly employed. However, Puerto Ricans' long-held fear of underestimating the hard work of those who turn out in droves to vote undermines any discussion that emphasizes shorter lines, convenience voting, post-registration or other cheaper means of direct participation. The fact is that these tactics may appear to increase turnout, but can actually increase damage to the voting process. Issues like voter apathy, wrong polling places, and missed data plate transfers do not necessarily allow individuals to vote for candidates who are less to their liking, however imperfect those candidates may be, thus making it far more difficult for people to do the right thing, which is how compromise can occur in our electoral system.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nhttp://www.gfdev.org/jrn.php\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMp7sU2A9b0\n\nhttp://www.deadrivals.com/\n\nhttps://www.drante.net/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Drante\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjYLxdjiBcOp36_HmO-RKg\n\nhttps://twitter.com/drante\n\nhttp://getalgargosenour.com", "human": "Puerto Ricans like to say that politics is the national sport, and who could argue with that? With a participation rate hovering near 80% and campaigning that features elaborate floats, loud music, and a carnival atmosphere, election day on the island comes off like a mix between Super Bowl Sunday and Mardi Gras. So when the results came in this week that a majority island voters had selected the statehood option on this year's plebiscite, it would seem to be an unprecedented, game-changing event.\n\nAfter all, in two of the three previous plebiscites, Commonwealth--the current status, which supporters call \"free associated state\" and detractors call \"colony,\"--was the clear winner. When the dust cleared and the 2012 tally was in, the numbers were striking: 61.2% of 1.8 million voters said they were in favor of statehood! The world would hold its breath to see if Congress could allow a 51st star would be added to Old Glory.\n\nBut it's not quite that simple. This was not your everyday straightforward plebiscite with Statehood, Commonwealth, and Independence (remember that?) options. It came out of a tortured political process that involved consultation with the President's Puerto Rico Task Force and in the end was never authorized by Congress. The plebiscite that Puerto Ricans voted for Tuesday involved a two-step process.\n\nThe first part of the vote asked \"Are you satisfied with the current territorial status?\" On that question, 54% voted no. Keep in mind that if you voted no here, you weren't necessarily against Commonwealth per se, you simply weren't satisfied with the current version of Commonwealth. The second question was \"Which status do you prefer?\" and the choices were Statehood, \"Sovereign Free Associated State\" (an as yet undetermined non-territorial hybrid of commonwealth and independence), and Independence.\n\nThis vote went to Statehood (61.5%), with \"Sovereign Free Associated State\" winning 33.3% of the vote and Independence 5.5%. A clear victory, right? Not exactly. During the campaign leading up to the vote the Popular Democratic Party, which represents the Commonwealth option, had been urging their followers to simply enter a blank vote in protest of the way the plebiscite was constructed, in their opinion to favor the statehood-supporting New Progressive Party.\n\nSo if you factor in the 466, 337 blank votes, Statehood only wins 45.1% of the total votes, and if you add the Sovereign Free Associated State and the blank ballots together, that would come to 51% of the votes, in other words, the same result of the plebiscites held in 1967 and 1993. In fact, it's almost a mirror image of the 1998 plebiscite, which was won by \"None of the Above,\" the option campaigned for by the PDP in protest of that statehood-party authored plebiscite, by a margin of 50.3% to 46.5%.\n\nTo complicate matters even further, Luis Fortu\u00f1o, the incumbent pro-statehood governor, was shockingly defeated by his Commonwealth party rival Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, leaving the statehood victory without its primary advocate. \"This was first and foremost just an opinion poll that was never a binding resolution,\" said William Ramirez, head of the ACLU in Puerto Rico. \"It's up to the party in power to go to Washington and slap it on someone's desk and fight for it.\"\n\nIn fact, all that incoming governor Garc\u00eda Padilla is obliged to do under the law is send a letter to Washington stating the results. It can be argued that even if Fortu\u00f1o won, he would have faced difficulty explaining why statehood should be considered when the option won only a plurality and not an absolute majority (over 50%) of the votes.\n\nIt is conceivable that Pedro Pierluisi, the island's incumbent resident commissioner (non-voting member of Congress), who is not only pro-statehood but a member of the Democratic Party with ties to Obama, might be able to argue the case, but that seems dubious given the absence of power of his office. Pierlusi was running again as running mate to Fortu\u00f1o (who is staunchly Republican). He was re-elected to Resident Commissioner. A recent paper published by Latino Decisions in anticipation of Tuesday's vote states that \"lawmakers are not likely to accept the outcomes of a status plebiscite that was not authorized by Congress.\"\n\nFor his part Garc\u00eda Padilla has already announced that he will hold a Constitutional Convention in Puerto Rico in 2014 and seek a new plebiscite that would be approved by Congress.\n\nStill, the incoming governor would do well to address the dissatisfaction with the current status that has been expressed by a majority of Puerto Ricans.

And some people would probably choose the same sports car's car without a dual exhaust.\n\nIf you're a crossover or an occasional off-roader then a straight exhaust will work. If you're bored of the beige, then a black sports exhaust will work. A couple of puffs may go a long way, if you're at all into car exhaust systems. The dual exhaust on the Ford Mustang GT350 is a great example.

Unfortunately many of us have heard stories about getting fuel drained out of our car's system after many months of the engine running cool. It's always good to check the spark plug wires or any leaks in the engine to check for things that can cause a problem. A fuel tap needs to have enough oil in it and is especially critical in cool weather.\n\nIf you find a leak near the fuel pump (or one near the crankshaft) then you should be able to get a good tank of fuel in the tank (the proper tension). The important thing is to check. To do this you need to be on a good charger, have the car plugged in the charger and running, you'll need to be running at least 25F to prevent leaks, you'll also need to have a cool car. The way I do it is: run the car in the car with an alternator running, with the starter switched off and with the trunk off, with the back off. Run the bike off the charger (to prevent possible leaks) if necessary. You'll need plenty of fuel (it's not good for the clutch).\n\nThe main thing to note is that in cold weather having the passenger battery cut can cause a fuel pump to need to be replaced. This is why you should be on a good charger that has a pre-set idle and (largely) keeps the charger running at the proper rpm.\n\nNow, plug in the tank and you have a dual exhaust! I wanted to make sure I'd gotten it installed correctly. After noting down the numbers from the dyno and uploading some pictures, I made the sure thing to do a full JPS test on the machine. I modified this into a type 3 (6-1/8\" exhaust), which by itself isn't very easy.\n\nClick Here To Go To My Video Review\n\nThe engine is a 66 horsepower double overhead cam 5.3, displacing approximately 440 cubic inches, the 6-1/8\" sections (or parts of which were drilled) are 2.5 inches, the 6-1/8\" diameter are 3 inches. The motor is a 2.3:1 ratio, there is also a 4.25:1 shift plate.\n\nBefore getting into the pictures of", "topp": "Flyin' Miata Dual Exhaust (June 2001)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIMHO a sports car just isn't right without a dual exhaust. Given a choice (case in point: Porsche 997 Turbo with GT2 turbos, or Mazda A6,A6R etc), I'll bet most cars would go for the exhaust in the nose cone area. Well, even a small car like a Carrera S, which can easily shed some weight when not on road, would go for a larger front cylinder opening. The fact that I could see it would almost 100% annoy me. Heck, I think 2 exits on both the exhaust system and bumper has replaced the 2 upper pip holes in the past few years as any Corvette guy will tell you \u2013 except to some Porsche Porsche F1 street, purely production two door vehicle. But with my clutch against my head there was no way I would go for a dual exhaust under the classic 6 speed stick all day. But as the topic of nannying keys started circulating on the forum it became a trending topic and so I decided to dive in and see what the debate was.\n\nI'll admit the minimum requirement for a car to get either a 3 or 4,000 lb. difference in height (or any other physical measurement really) is around 20 inches. And to be honest, looking at photos of the Sierra Trucker trucks from the mid 1970s up close made me think the race car angle is far too tall for a port style exhaust. So I did the research I should have done a long time ago on how to get the most out of a Honda NSX V6 (supposedly very close to in the not so distant past \u2013 refer to the above photo and description) or a BMW M3 at Stock. So as you can see with a mild spread of fender flares and rebar reinforcement from 1968 and with a pair of crude diff mounts in place to bare metal mount joints and Eibach front hydraulic dampers including the Cooper rear bushing I had an idea of what works for me.\n\nMaintenance Plans\n\nNow that we're in a sort of \"if they can do it that is the max\" territory I needed to identify the total expense to make the work (train and brakes) as simple as possible. And also minimise the risk of failure. So I looked around for providers and suppliers for rust prevention and hydraulic systems, durability builds, transmission and timing chains and such and I arranged a weekend with some friends down in the tropics to \"start preparing\" the dirty little engine bay.\n\nAs well as the insurance premium cost this is an undisclosed, direct charge for services (as are most stuff these days) I was debating. But given how important it would be and how much work I would be doing it was no biggie. Plus with my own gut feelings and terms not giving a crap why change.\n\nFor those who have been around the market and know what's going on here knows I love my cold work. And a delivery date needed to be agreed at this point. Like the above photos an \"autumn\" delivery would mean being right behind schedule of either a 2017 or some such future date. They'll all be too fast for me to wait. If they'll get on time I'll wait and chide them for when. If they come on time I'll have built up years in the savings store of competent, successful build and shipped tomorrow. There is no point me taking the risk of kind of \"like building a car out of shit\" (my language much appreciated).\n\nAt this stage I mean once all the leading edges and means are removed everything, even the particularly exotic items are fine.\n\nThe bike side started early indeed. The set up would be originally designed and built on the Yamaha or Alfina (we'll work on the mini-bike), but it just kind of worked.

Given a choice (and a birthday requiring a shiny present to myself :-), I went mad and bought the best: a Flyin' Miata dual exhaust. It wasn't cheap (after shipping to the UK!). But oh boy is it shiny!\n\n...as you can see! Its all stainless-steel construction should hopefully mean it'll last for yonks. It certainly does seem very well made, and the tips are just gorgeously chunky. I remember with a grin that some manufacturers spray their silencers black so they can't be seen - but looking at this one, you almost want to fit some kind of mirror under the car so the people following you can see how beautiful it is :-)\n\nIn the (big!) box was the exhaust, 2 pages of clear, illustrated fitting instructions, and an extra hanger bracket and rubber hanger. I also bought some exhaust jointing putty to ensure a good seal on the joint.\n\nFitting\n\nFitting took me just under 2 hours, as I was very careful to get everything right. The first and almost the longest task was to get the car up on axle stands, as I was unsure of a good spot for them, and really didn't want to be squished or damage the car in any way!\n\nThe scary part came next - cutting a hole out of the plastic bumper to accomodate the second exhaust tip. You only get one go at holes, so I was understandably nervous! The kit includes a stick-on template to shape the hole, so it was a simple matter of measuring, tacking the template in place with sellotape, standing back, checking, holding the dual exhaust in place and asking a friend if it looked centred, standing back and looking again, re-measuring, sticking the template on properly, checking again, measuring just to be certain, then eventually trusting my judgement, cutting carefully and slowly with a small hacksaw blade, and finally swearing loudly when I found the hole was slightly too far to the left!! But not too far out - I'm sure nobody will really notice it. But quite annoying after all the care that went into trying to get it right!! (I think my measuring prowess is a major reason why I never became a carpenter)\n\nThe rest of the install went very smoothly, although getting the old exhaust out of the rubber hangers was a bit tough on my fingers (hindsight hints: apply a spray-on grease and if things don't slide out easily, apply a bit of finesse with a very small screwdriver to ease the edge of the rubber past the stops! Using a strong cardboard box to support the underside of the silencer while working it free was also a great help. Finally, I wore safety glasses, and avoided getting a lot of crud and plastic shavings in my eyes!)\n\nNext, an extra hanger must be fitted by removing one bolt from the heat shield and slotting the bracket behind the shield - the supplied bracket was not quite long enough, so I had to file about a millimetre off the edge of the shield to get it to fit perfectly.\n\nFinally, I just had to lift the FM exhaust into place - I slotted it onto the 2 bolts at the end of the main pipe first, then it was really easy to get the rest hooked into the hangers. I was able to re-use the original gasket on the joint, and added a bit of exhaust jointing putty to ensure a good seal, before tightening the 2 nuts to complete the joint. A gentle drive to heat and set the putty finished off the job.\n\nResults\n\nFirstly: It looks great! (Well, I think so). See the images page for a nicer picture, but here's how it looked about 17 seconds after I had it off the axle stands:\n\nSome people have mentioned problems with dual exhausts hanging too low (or one side hanging lower than the other), but this install looked perfectly positioned the moment I slid the last hanger into place.\n\nHow does it sound? Fan-tas-tic! At idle, it burbles purposefully. Just below 2000rpm, there is a bit of unpleasant resonance in the cabin, but as I spend minimal time below 2000rpm (in 1st gear only), this really isn't a problem, except maybe occasionally when crawling in awful traffic.

But for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (the group known as Isis) besieging large parts of Iraq and Syria is near.\n\nAlready, one of the deadliest battles is unfolding in the Shaddadi mountain range south-east of Mosul. Few know its fighting history. It is the moment Isis launches its biggest advance to date.\n\nFaced with a resilient, three-line battle-line, Isis used modern military equipment. It attacked three key routes to the oil refinery on the outskirts of Tikrit, putting them at risk. The defence failed, the refinery and surrounding city fell to Isis within three days.\n\nEach military forces on the ground will deploy units that can counter Isis offensive. The first hope of Britain and France: \"al-Qa'eda must be defeated, otherwise Mosul will not fall\". Al-Qa'eda is a Shia-led religious movement blamed for the murder of hundreds of Sunni Muslims in Iraq and Syria in a bloody 10-year insurgency.\n\nA Foreign Office statement called out the leader of the National Security Council, Jeremy Hunt, for failing to ensure \"the success of the operation\". He is due to travel to the region on Monday.\n\nThe message comes amid warnings from US Secretary of Defence Ash Carter over the dangers of being drawn into the \"very dangerous game of engaging with these groups\".\n\nThe Kurdish peshmerga fighters, who have stopped Isis advance on the streets of Syria and Iraq, are the main allies of the US-led coalition, but Nato nations are also drawn in.\n\nLeading a working group for Syria, Mr Carter's biggest foreign policy crisis since taking office, Mr Carter raised concerns about sending \"weapons to militants and providing arms to Assad\", according to a report by the New Yorker.\n\nDespite the Kurdish fighters' efforts to isolate Isis fighters, there are fears in Baghdad that the violence will engulf Iraq.\n\n\"Violence is going to spread and intensify and the Kurdish forces have to lead in this,\" Vice-President Osama Nujaifi told the BBC from neighbouring Turkey, where he visited security officers involved in the fighting along the Turkey-Syria border.\n\n\"They have to back the Syrian people and stop this war. The one thing we cannot do is become involved and then have a civil war.\"\n\nHis warning came after two suicide bombings killed 122 people in the northern Iraqi city of Diyala. At least a dozen people were also killed when a car carrying four suicide bombers struck the southern Iraqi city of Basra in May.\n\nSaudi Arabia is to host a major Nato summit on 23-23 April, and reports say a transatlantic meeting of leaders from the 28-member Nato alliance is planned for May.\n\nMr Obama, who attended the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on Tuesday evening, described the \"natural questions\" raised about the aim, scope and cost of Nato. \"Some people will ask: why now,\" he said.\n\nBut he insisted Nato would be in a position to \"stand up for our values\". He added: \"Many have challenged us at our patience because of the constant response from some in the region to NATO calling for more force and yet the number of deployed forces did not grow. That had to change.\"\n\nUS defence secretary Carter had planned to visit Baghdad to discuss preparations for the summit, but told reporters he would not be able to do so because of security concerns.\n\nLibya is also in crisis as rebels fighting to oust longtime leader Col Muammar Gaddafi urge it to turn to Russia.\n\n\"It is crucial that it changes its position,\" said Mustafa Badreddine of the Washington-based Libyan American Council. \"If it acts more like the Russians, the regime will lose.\"\n\nBut Igor Sutyagin, a Moscow-based analyst who is an expert on Russia's ties with Libya, told the Financial Times the Kremlin was likely to agree to mediation. Russia is already so close to Libya that it has troops stationed on ships in Tripoli.\n\n\"If we cannot have a strong partner on this mission, our Libya policy will have to be significantly changed,\" Mr Sutyagin added.\n\n\"Russia is an important partner in the international coalition, and would give NATO a bigger role in security and international affairs. That should not happen now.\"\n\nRussia has held anti-regime military manoeuvres in Syria and offered military assistance to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, yet Mr Carter questioned whether Moscow's Moscow links meant it would support both Mr Assad and the rebels. He also suggested the UN Security Council should ask the UN security council to use its veto power.\n\n\"I'm not going to use that veto power for such a political debate,\" he said. \"A few days ago, I spoke to the president of France about a high-level topic about Syria, about Syria's future. I need to assure him of the secretary's commitment", "topp": "The world's attention is on the stricken city of Kobani, in northern Syria. But for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (the group known as Isis) besieging Raqqa in the south of the country, this isn't a pressing threat. And so for the militants, Syrian forces appear to be their real problem: while the insurgency in Homs and Quneitra is being pushed back, the Islamic State is hard at work building on the territory lost in Isis' southern heartlands.\n\nIsis seems determined to build and then exploit an \"Islamic state\" from Raqqa and its environs south of the Euphrates that will be strong enough to cut off the jihadists' key supply line to and from Libya, where it controls a swathe of territory, and to its heartland in Iraq.\n\nJust as the blowback from its high-profile operations in Mosul and Diyala city was spurring the Arabs and Kurds to mobilise for the last major offensive on Isis' east Mosul stronghold, so the extremists seem to have relished their longstanding domination of Raqqa, to the effect that Raqqa is now seeing a resurgence of this insurgent ideology. Isis' ambitions in Syria and Iraq are now all but out of their control. Their ambition to impose a caliphate \u2013 or caliphate-style Sunni rule \u2013 seems destined to end with its demise. \"ISIS is in a constant state of renewal,\" a senior American official told me. \"They keep trying to reinvent themselves each day. They're very inventive at the thought of going back to the caliphate.\"\n\nThe Syrian Kurds and the powerful Islamist factions that nominally represent the Syrian opposition at the UN represent a very effective counterweight to Isis \u2013 and their advances in recent weeks, including against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant at Jarablus, suggest that Isis' days as a state are over, if not over his own global ambitions. However, while the Syrian Kurds and the Islamists are on a collision course, the Iraqi Shia-led government and Iran \u2013 the regime's ally and most powerful regional player in the region \u2013 are also looking down on Isis' implosion and deal with it with a sense of irony.\n\nFrom Baghdad to Beirut: Shia rebels find a role for themselves as Isis tanks leave Mosul Read more\n\nIsis is dying: it is no longer the supreme prophet. And as the organisation shifts its focus from capturing such large areas as Mosul to conducting lethal operations against its rivals in places like Syria, in Iraq, and within the broader region, this battlefield suicide can lead to a history of resurgence that is too often completely failed.\n\nIn 2003, when Isis attacked the US military in Baghdad, it proved to be somewhat exasperating. During a twenty-minute massacre of Iraqi soldiers not allowed to leave their barracks, hundreds of US soldiers defended against the murderous onslaught. The retaking of Tikrit, after some months of fierce fighting, was brutal and seen as a serious setback for America's successes against al-Qaida. But even as US tanks prepared to roll through Baghdad, US troops were securing Saddam Hussein's home town of Tikrit, off-limits to the military for decades because of alleged links to the Iranian regime. And in an even more surprising development, Shiite militia proxies called Hashd al-Shaabi were being sent into the country as the umbrella organisation for all Iraq's civilians.\n\nFour years later, when Isis bombed the Shia shrine city of Samarra, killing nearly 500 people and tens of thousands of Shiites, it was understood in Washington to be a piece of a war on the Shia, and Washington had immediately sought to take its military action to the Iraqi people. The White House had immediately withdrawn its forces, scotching much of the postwar reconstruction. And so the US war against the Iraqi insurgency dragged on for five more years, then ended in April last year with the capture of Mosul. The terrible victory over Isis has secured the future of the country. But there will be tomorrows to contend with. And without Isis, Iraq and Syria will already be unstable and violent for decades to come.\n\nThat's why Isis should be taken seriously, both at the decision point of withdrawing US troops from Iraq and, increasingly, into the post-Isis scenario. By bringing itself \"to heel\" with the other combatants in this region, Isis can extract concessions from its rivals; the only question will be whether it allows them to guarantee their election as the central authority in a Syria or Syria-Iraq or even Syria or Syria-Israel, and then permits all of these subjects to exist in a civilisational peace that continues beyond any British occupation or future American occupation of the region. In a counterintuitive calculation, the idea of keeping ISIS alive reflects American interests in the region. But that in itself isn't the \"good\" long-term outcome. Ultimately, the US should face up to that fact that its incentives in the region aren't aligned with that of its allies and the Shia community in Iran and, by extension, Israel. It should withdraw as", "human": "The world's attention is on the stricken city of Kobani, in northern Syria. But for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (the group known as Isis) besieging the town, it is not the Turkish borderlands but Iraq where the real thrust of its military activity currently falls.\n\nIsis in recent weeks has won a series of victories in Iraq's Anbar province, putting a significant strategic coup within its grasp: a swath of contiguous territory stretching from its heartlands in Syria to the doorstep of Baghdad.\n\n\"It's not just about Kobani,\" Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon's spokesperson, said on Wednesday. \"We believe that they're largely in control of the [Iraqi] town of Hit right now, which is not that far from Fallujah and Ramadi, and Fallujah and Ramadi are not that far from Baghdad. And we seem to have forgotten about that.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's warnings follow others that paint a somewhat dim broader picture of the current fight against the insurgency: western and Arab state air strikes against Isis appear to have reached the peak of their impact, and though Isis has been beaten back by Iraqi and Kurdish forces in some key areas in northern Iraq, its momentum appears unchallenged elsewhere.\n\n\"Isis has been advancing despite the air strikes,\" said Hassan Hassan, a Syria analyst at the Delma Institute in Abu Dhabi. \"They have almost taken Kobani. What are we going to do when they have taken over the city? It will be an example of how the air strikes have not been working.\"\n\nIsis has certainly had to adapt its tactics because of the air campaign \u2013 an effort that has already seen almost 2,000 sorties flown and 370 bombs dropped. Jihadi commanders no longer mass their troops openly, isolated military camps and bases have been abandoned in favour of urban areas, and electronic communications have been curbed, according to intelligence officials who have been building a picture of Isis's modus operandi.\n\nBut the group's core strategy appears in place.\n\n\"I see Isis doing exactly what it was doing before,\" says Jessica Lewis, a former US military intelligence officer in Iraq and now research director at the Institute for the Study of War. \"They are showing they can absorb different types of bombardment and continue with their ground campaign \u2013 they are not laying off.\"\n\nAt the core of that strategy, according to Ms Lewis's research, is the consolidation of territory as both a military and socio-political objective inherent to the jihadis' narrative of creating a \"caliphate\".\n\nIsis's recent, overlooked Anbar offensive is a case in point. The group has not only humiliated elite Iraqi special forces there, it has isolated them. Jihadis have surrounded Iraqi positions in Ramadi and Haditha, and they are hitting them hard with waves of truck bombs and signature blitzkrieg-style vehicle strikes. They have severed other lines of communication with Baghdad.\n\nMost of the Euphrates valley is now within their control and if Ramadi, the last remaining centre of anti-Isis resistance, is overcome, then the jihadis will hold sway over territory from Qaim on the Syrian border right up to Abu Ghraib in Baghdad's suburbs.\n\nIt is the echo of an earlier campaign in Syria, which was also paralleled with a threatened humanitarian crisis that held the world's attention.\n\nIn August, while governments led by the US were focused on averting an impending catastrophe facing thousands of Yazidis stranded on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, Isis was also waging a vicious and fast campaign to wipe out all remaining resistance in Syria's ar-Raqqa governorate.\n\nIn depth Iraq crisis As lethal sectarian violence rises, the US has authorised air strikes to halt the advance of Isis Further reading\n\nOne of Isis's biggest strategic gains to date, the capture of the Tabqa air base from Bashar al-Assad's forces in late August, went almost unnoticed.\n\nIt is still far from certain whether Isis's actions fit into an overarching strategic game plan, driven by military expertise, or are merely a loosely connected series of tactical coups.\n\nDaveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the centre for the study of terrorist radicalisation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, believes that it is probably the latter.\n\n\"In Anbar, certainly, they have been tactically brilliant. But is there a co-ordinated battle plan with what is going on in Syria? What is the point in taking Kobani? To me, Isis has an extraordinarily genocidal set of political inclinations \u2013 a genocidal rage against the Kurds, and that is what has driven that.\"\n\nIt is, says Mr Gartenstein-Ross, a \"strategic blunder\".\n\n\"This is an organisation that has eyes bigger than its stomach.

{"eta": "In my last post, I wrote two short stories about two goals that I had in the past that resulted in different outcomes.\n\nThe first was on my failure to make a boyfriend before I graduated high school: how I would have to break my competition. This one involved inventing a solution that would simultaneously employ the first four steps, and reveal a new physics principle. The second was on how to make sure that there is enough room in each step for more work, in order to avoid stagnate solutions.\n\nIn the last post, I talked about the idea of kanzoh-mi, or a unifying principle that links together the successes and failures of a project, and how to increase its potential. In this post, I continue the evolution by talking about how the common myths or common assumptions that limit our creativity are partly due to a broken model of how to use goals to create real progress and a focus on the wrong tools for that purpose.\n\nThis is the first part of this post.\n\nMyths and ideas that prevent people from making progress\n\nMyths and ideas that prevent people from making progress\n\nSomehow, people have a lot of doubts about achieving anything. Actually, our experience with failure comes from their belief that the fact that something went wrong means we did everything right and could have gone even further. It might be that the thought that we should do these things better because it was difficult or uncomfortable was a subconscious reaction to how we were taught to think. And, also, sometimes it is just something that is hard to accept.\n\nJust a few hours before I met him as a recruiter for the new job, I sat next to a couple who each had two decades of experience. They had made several previous mistakes in the process of being recruited and used the search process as a test case to understand its impact. As a test case, they had no real goals and were thinking about ways to ensure that they won't make another mistake later. But as they spoke, they grew increasingly proud of their past results of making mistakes, and their admiration turned to respect and appreciation.\n\nAt first, these two clearly needed to be isolated. And that is not necessary but just required. Neither of them has one big vision of how they can achieve their goals. Instead, their problems have to be solved more through collaboration, which is rarely something that can be done in one or two attempts.\n\nWithout the myths and expectations to guide and support the ideas and activities described here, it is all too easy to overlook the movement of individuals toward a bigger and more meaningful life. Indeed, the competition aspect of the search process brings with it a frame of mind that hinders progress rather than encourages it.\n\nMyth 1. Competing isn't the way to success.\n\nWhen people think about how to make progress, they often think of competition. But competition isn't the only way to accomplish what one wants. Often, only one idea, outcome, or reason to pursue is sufficient to ensure success.\n\nYet many of us have a competing goal in our minds about what work we should be doing, what hours we should work, and how we should prioritize it. The underlying reason is that there's something about feeling good about trying something and being successful that brings us back to that competitive impulse. When a reward (or a sense of accomplishment) is involved, then the competition gap is closed: if we don't perform up to the high expectations of anyone in our industry, our odds of succeeding get smaller and smaller.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of conflicting information about what the \"right\" thing to be doing is and how to reach that \"right\" thing. Finding that individual answer is hard. The same is true of figuring out why a person decides to make choices. And solving those problems requires really good data and insight. As researchers have said: \"No clear solution is possible since a'solution' simply isn't there in our minds, nor in the data.\"\n\nAfter me, the researcher explained: \"You see this weird phenomenon where people experience significant reductions in their overall level of functioning for years, even if they achieve something in a few weeks\" (A. R. Newland, New Journal of Psychology, 2016, http://www.thenewjournals.com/life/ \u2026 corr\u00e9)\n\nThis is because the most important reason to try something is not because somebody is telling you to do it well, or to do something to satisfy your curiosity. The most important reason to try is usually because your good idea is attractive (either to you or your boss),, or because it helps you get off to something exciting and unique, or because you're trying because you feel you're moving toward something useful, valuable, or innovative.\n\nDetermining those different reasons or motivating factors leads to a need for more different insights about what to do. There's a lack of clarity about how to actually reach a goal and more of a focus on common obstacles and barriers", "topp": "In my last post, I wrote two short stories about two goals that I had in the past that resulted in different outcomes.\n\nThe first was on my failure to make a bottom-up site trading account with Silvercrest while looking through the other members in the Escrow Room in June 2014 (cf. Part 4). The second story was on I'll-just-build-an-impressive-footpath-without-looking-up-to-see-why-it-feels-wrong-that-life-is-that-sort-of-difficult.\n\nIn this first post, I wrote about my sort-of-competing-performance goal of, and reason for what was failing to fall in line with what I was trying to do.\n\nIn this second post, I'll share what I learned from other critiques I received (yes, as they said, people were looking in each others' eyes) and my thoughts on the outcome of my efforts.\n\nWhat is a Ticker?\n\nWhat distinguishes a marketmaker from a speculator is the core amount of activity over which they undertake to exploit a scenario. The tulip mania (in its infinite variety) held as many as 23,000 separate trades, or only about one half of a speculator's market exposure. More meaningful numbers, however, are the statistical analysis numbers. There may be an 1 in 10100 chance that, on some day, another system will be far more inflating than tulip. If the tulip speculators get rich, so will we!\n\nA marketmaker is making demand for a particular risk. I do not try to mimic. Instead, I attempt to appeal to the unique market tendency and the human inclination to act within that tendency. Marketmakers are a difference from speculators.\n\nAs for the market itself, I trade all this and more in my Trading World.\n\nThe importance of expecting profits\n\nIt doesn't cost much to transfer money to an equity investment. Suppose I buy 2 shares of usd x for 2.0 x$0.05 = $1000. The investment makes me $50, or 2 x $1000. For a marketmaker, time required to transfer money will increase proportionally to the total portfolio of shares received by the estate at the time of death, and the total portfolio will eventually exceed the initial investment.\n\nA marketmaker's decisions are really informed by the expected return.\n\nMy money market fantasy\n\nAlthough I felt like my speculative gains had been systematically underestimated, I still needed to ship orders if I wanted to make my speculative positions in ETFs, stock-bond indexes, or shorter-duration futures to pay off. I set the floor on futures trading at 35 cents per trade.\n\nI offered traders a 30% premium by settling in the transacted transaction \u2014 for one less stage of risk.\n\nI then offered a rebate for up to 1,000 HEDs, as well as a matching fee of 2% on orders with a floor higher than 35 cents.\n\nI then assumed a regulation-based bid/ask spread of 4% on all open orders made within the network.\n\nAccordingly, there are three trade-offs with a 42% level of expected returns:\n\nv1 : short positions with a lower risk premium have an advantage over M-O options by virtue of their pricing advantage.\n\nv2 : short positions have an edge over open order features that price at more predictable levels to achieve a higher risk premium.\n\nv3 : open orders have an edge because many open positions incur additional costs to ship to my network instead of my uni-ring of options, the prevalent pricing feature of equities.\n\nHistorical example\n\nIf you take the index of our four large-cap Dividend Stocks, the experience is as follows:\n\nN/A\n\nYesterday, the S&P 500 ETF was down 8%, and the ASX had a junk run that pushed it down 14.5%. No one was spending money. Yes, our average ETF pays dividends every year at about 6 cents per share.\n\nIf you take the index of the three smaller-cap Dividend Stocks, the experience is like this:\n\nN/A\n\nYesterday, the S&P 500 ETF was up 4.5%, and the ASX had a junk run that pushed it down 2%. No one was spending money. Most average ETFs pay their dividends on time and pay cash out of the income stream once the company pays them.\n\nYou have a compelling reason to move towards trading your expense ratios into the real-world because that method of payment will lower the probability of getting sucked into that (very) exclusive band of stock that has little upside but may provide the option of shifting the focus from this vision of future insanity.\n\nBy contrast, I won't offer the benefit of lower risk than two contract", "human": "In my last post, I wrote two short stories about two goals that I had in the past that resulted in different outcomes.\n\nThe first was on my failure to make the California state track & field meet in high school, and the second was on how I accomplished my goal of getting at least 3-4 top-tier conference papers in grad school.\n\nI should be happy with reaching the second goal. However, in retrospect, I don't feel very good about it. In fact, I mentally beat myself up about it sometimes.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I failed myself in the process of achieving the goal.\n\nHere is how.\n\nTwo problems with goals.\n\nGoals can be highly motivational, but they can also have unintended negative consequences. Here are two that I experienced.\n\nFirst, the goal may shift your priorities, and cause you to optimize for reaching the goal instead of optimizing for what you should really focus on.\n\nIn my case, the focus on paper count negatively changed my priorities. Instead of focusing on finding the big problems, I quickly learned how to spot ideas that were highly publishable. Instead of examining the problems as thoroughly as I could, I did the minimum amount of work necessary to create the data for a paper. In academia, we call these LPUs (Least Publishable Unit). I became very good at creating a LPUs around novel and publishable ideas.\n\nThis isn't good. I would have served myself better by finding big problems and tackling them as thoroughly as I could.\n\nSecond, by attaining the goal, you may actually fall short of your potential.\n\nPartway through my PhD, I transferred from the University of Colorado to Northwestern University. My expectation was that I'd graduate in 3 more years at Northwestern. I left Colorado with one top-tier paper under my belt, and hit Northwestern in full stride. In the first year there, I got two more top-tier papers.\n\nYes, that means I reached the goal!\n\nSo what did I proceed to do? I got comfortable. The next year, I published one paper, and the final year, I got a short paper into a top conference. I count all of those as 4.5 top-tier papers.\n\nI blew past the goal of 3-4 top-tier papers, but when I look back on it now, it doesn't feel good. I know I could have done way better than that if I continued to push.\n\nMy goals and their unintended outcomes.\n\nI'm not ashamed of my grad school days. I am pretty proud of the progress, and still like some of the work I did. But I know I was capable of more, and I hate knowing that.\n\nYou remember the first goal of making the California state meet? The one where I failed?\n\nThe funny thing is that I regret not making the state meet, but I don't regret anything else about it. I certainly don't feel bad about the failure. I know that I trained as hard as I could, and I feel confident that I didn't leave much at the table.\n\nIn short, my failure was a success, and my success was a failure.\n\nI've learned my lesson.\n\nThese days, I don't focus much on goals anymore.\n\nI focus on execution. I focus on learning. I focus on my craft. I focus on being good. And then being better than that. And then better.. and better..\n\nWhen I work this way, I'm always proud of myself. I don't say it in a trite \"feel-good\" sort of way. I feel genuinely proud because I am trying as hard as I can.\n\nWhat else can you ask for?\n\nOccasionally, I'll hit a milepost (which could be considered a goal). I acknowledge it, and then pat myself on the back to celebrate the progress. But then I keep moving forward because moving forward is the right thing to focus on.\n\n\u2013\n\nP.S.

{"eta": "Review: Southown's brand-new Burger Culture a welcome blast from the past\n\nA half-pound ground chuck burger on a sesame seed bun from Burger Culture.\n\nWhen the first burger giant, In-N-Out, debuted two years ago, it signaled a more moderate menu. Most options were standard for any fast-food chain: one- or two-meat sandwich specials, steak fries, fried chicken, etc. There was a soy cheeseburger or two, too.\n\nFast-casual restaurant Burger Culture (now owned by Popeyes) pushed the notion of a \"Burger Culture,\" at least on paper. Its \"Crazy Burger,\" one of two fresh menu items at Southown \u2014 just a few blocks away from Brick Works on Water Street, the food court where I was lured on a whim by Burger Culture's offerings \u2014 reminded me how hard it is to get people to eat in the old days.\n\nSalty pulled BBQ from the line of a Southown worker and garnished with a banana split. The Burger Culture Bubble Wrap. Image: James Eskenazi\n\nIt seemed like every booth had a burger, including the two in front of us. This seemed unfair, because like all high-end burger chains, Southown is going through a difficult transition. A prominent investor sold a piece of his $365 million company to a private equity firm earlier this year. Two restaurants, featuring the Southown name, will close, one to be replaced by a Burger Kings franchise in East Lansing. It's the second outlet that the new owners have announced they're open to leasing from.\n\nThe Southown rebranding is another step in a developing trend. One franchise owner reported last fall that only about half as many families had eaten his burgers in the past ten years as had been in the previous half-century. The co-owners of Burger's Mouth Pub, a bygone neighborhood spot serving chili, nachos, and clam chowder, agreed last year that 30-second TV spots advertising all the new-found regional chains were a waste of time. So Burger Culture and Burger Kings quickly rolled out \"Crazed Brats\" with pink names and faux animal ears. \"The new era starts with the hype,\" told the crowed crowd at last September's Southown Miami Beach Burger Party, a party I co-hosted with his co-conspirators.\n\nLining up for their first bite with other patrons, Daniel Montag and his wife, Carly, both show-business related (she's an actor and he's a producer), bought into the allure of a \"dark, grungy\" California-style burger joint. \"Crazed Brats,\" it turns out, are among Southown's most innovative offerings.\n\nI poked my head inside the booth. \"Wow, it's really cool,\" said one man. \"They're giving us little animals, and they're just meowing really, really loud.\" But I wouldn't take my eyes off the \"Crazed Brats,\" though most of the ingredients that make their barking or producing noise seemed to be urine mixed with the sugary beverage that came out of a straw that was affixed to the top of their burgers.\n\n\nThis table-service taco from Southown's new menu. Image: James Eskenazi\n\nThe sign that warned outside was a cross between what I'd seen and what I heard in Southtown:\n\n\n2 bucks more.\n\nI didn't eat the items, thinking I was wasting my time. What were they trying to prove, though? Or worse, am I just wasting my money when I still pay less than those who enjoy a burger from another neighborhood? Now a few months later, I'd become more tolerant of Southtown's booths, but I still gravitate to the \"hot dog guy.\" He didn't mince or chop his buns, though I do notice a growing habit of sampling overpriced sizzle steak on the menu.\n\n\"You're a hot dog guy, but you do stuff that's different,\" said a shopper.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I work here too,\" said the hot dog guy.\n\n\"That's for chrissakes!\" said his customer.\n\nSome customer feedback about the new burgers (there's always a slight possibility one of these. Who knows?) was a negative, too.\n\n\"The burgers are really are not as good as you would hope,\" said one woman.\n\n\"Didn't they have lamb rump steak one time,\" said another. \"They've not had that one yet.\"\n\n\"Tight,\" said another.\n\nWhatever the local competition, if you're hip to the new burger culture, you have to order more than one of these. But I wasn't about to try that first. My friends \u2014 all hardcore burger aficionados, in-universe \u2014 had each saved up for a dollar and", "topp": "Review: Southown's brand-new Burger Culture a welcome blast from the past\n\nA half-pound ground chuck burger on a sesame seed bun from Burger Culture.\n\nGo to Burger Culture's website and check out the tasting menu before making your decision, which includes the official name of the restaurant (Southown), the items that are offered at Burger Culture, and the beers they offer. The Smirnoff Fizzle WaiLao is in there, and the housemade special hard cider you can try in one of their Champagne glasses is $14. It's not offered in beer, but the keg or bottle is very limited.\n\nIf you're interested in burgers and beer, you're probably going to end up going to Southown. Southown sits opposite the Ilitch Family Ice Arena, so when hockey season starts, it feels like you're at home. You can walk around Southown, check out the newly painted street sign, where the 300-page burger menu has been used as paper trail and you can even play hide and seek with the hordes of skaters wearing polo shirts and bow ties.\n\nUnder the lights, it's an exotic, en vogue place \u2014 if a little pretentious. Burgers are much cheaper at Southtown, and the Philly Cheesesteak special is one of Southtown's signature items. (There are many other variations, from chopped brisket to chicken and Waffle Barbecue pork chops, but those aren't listed on the menu.) But if you're old enough, you know what you want to order.\n\nThe bread is so deep and solid that it holds together even without, say, a double shot of the next-best-thing. You can even get chips off the top and they're filled with creamy char-grilled onions. The cheese fries are Swiss grilled as well. Pickled carrots and white cheddar chips add texture, but even without a fancy dipping sauce, they stay on the sesame seed bun. One source suggests the one on the menu is a favorite, but I'm skeptical because the bites that were ice cold three years ago are fresh and the ones I've had weren't nearly as good.\n\nOh, and the fries. Sprinkled with chipotle chilies and jack cheese, they're chewy and melt-in-the mouth. Plus, the beans are melted and cooked like hot dogs. Gotta wonder if that helps them last much longer \u2014 the hot dog smells funky.\n\nI wish Burger Culture offered more than just burgers. Try the Cozy Kiss sandwich: lettuce, fried onions, slaw, dill pickles, shredded cheddar and a side of cheese fries. The stuff looks like it gets a lot of use: Chicago-based developer Norbert Teutsch specializes in small apartments, but this was one of the space's signature items. Eat at Southtown and you'll also find a large selection of sandwiches, salads, soups, soups and salads, burgers, sandwiches, salads, burgers, burgers, burgers, salads, relish, dip and dressing.\n\nI wish Southtown was a place where you could go out for the family, not just if you're in the neighborhood. Hopefully that changes. Still, it's a sign of what remains of Old North Upland: Here there's great, old-world cuisine with a youthful, carefree vibe. In just a few years it's already become a trendy spot for locals as well. With a specialty burger menu on-hand and a show when the Scottrade Center opens in 2018, can you blame them?\n\nNorthfield: A great neighborhood grocery with wine, beer and spirits\n\nYes, there's a grocery, too. Mr. & Mrs. Wal-Mart had their spot in Northfield, but so did Restaurants Northfield and CBA Nordic, all settled in places along its eastern border, which has been expanded recently to include Northfield Crossing.\n\nNot only is a grocery a large 20,000-square-foot space but it also functions as a 25-plus retail and restaurant store, plus, for a meal, serving up one of the best sandwiches in the region. Its employees have the biggest lunch specials of any quick service restaurant in all of Central Ohio, from Mondays to Fridays, except for St. Elmo's Chicken (when it closes from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.) and only about a handful of days. It's opening in time for Christmas, when you can pay to catch a show at The Met, when the weekends are back, and on weekends now. (A new little bar called Zaus Caf\u00e9 is coming soon, too. The first day? Jan. 4.)\n\nSuper Saturday was in January. Turns out there's all sorts of talk about Trump's immigration ban, and a debate about its possible impact on the retail side.

When one-in-five Democrats (20%) is asked whether it is better that all guns should be kept out of reach of children or that not all guns should be kept out of reach of children, the vast majority (83%) of liberals say the latter.\n\nA majority of Independents (57%) largely agree that gun owners should have a right to keep their guns at home, with 57% against \"a national background check system that would involve more checks for people who are trying to sell guns outside of their home\".\n\nHalf of Democrats and two-thirds of Independents Favor an End to Gun \"Sales to Minorities\"\n\nEven among Democrats (54% on the question of gun sales to minorities), two-thirds (68%) say that Americans should be prohibited from having \"a gun in the home to sell to a person of a certain race or ethnicity, including Jews, Muslims, Hispanics, blacks and Latinos.\" Support for this is strongest among white liberals (76%) vs. blacks (61%).\n\nAt the same time, support for this ban is weaker among Independents (32% say \"a national background check system that would involve more checks for people who are trying to sell guns outside of their home\") than among moderates (48%). Among Democrats and independents alike, only 29% think a \"universal background check system that will require a simple background check on every sale of all guns\" is preferable. More believe that \"a national background check system would be the best way to go about it\" (54%) than that it is preferable to \"an outright ban on all gun sales to black and Latino people \u2013 a position supported by gun owners a broad majority\" (36%).\n\nA majority of Independents (53%) oppose prohibiting firearms sales to minorities, compared with just 30% who favor this position. Among Democrats, majorities favor (54%) and oppose (31%) the idea of prohibiting gun sales to minorities.\n\nOnly 27% of Democrats Support a National Gun Background Check System\n\nThis survey finds that 27% of Democratic registered voters say their party should oppose a federal gun background check system that is designed to check guns in transactions involving individuals the FBI has determined are no longer considered to be a threat.\n\nIn contrast, 65% of Democrats support a nationwide system, including 9 in 10 who say they favor making the system available to private and federal sellers.\n\nRepublicans oppose this idea (77%), and independents lean towards opposing (48%).\n\nHeld the NBC News poll from September 25-30 among 892 American adults, telephone interviews conducted by Hart Research Associates, Inc.

This survey was released at 3:00 p.m. Eastern time Friday afternoon.\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThe NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls are among the most extensive public opinion surveys in the US. They have a 20/20 sampling frame, applying modern statistical procedures and four decades worth of polling methodology to comprehensive samples of people of all ages and ethnicities to analyze questions of national and political importance.\n\nThe polls are designed to provide the most detailed answer to the precise question of how public opinion in the United States has changed in the last 30 years.\n\nThe polls have found that most Americans continue to identify as Democrats or lean towards that party. In addition, many see the Republican party as the party of conspiracy and skepticism about the government. A small minority \u2013 16 percent \u2013 say the Republican Party should be more supportive of the principles of limited government and individual freedoms.\n\nThe surveys also show that large majorities of Americans approve of Barack Obama's job performance. Nearly eight-in-ten (79%) approve of the way Obama has handled the economy, and 79 percent approve of his handling the nation's security problems. His job approval is higher among independents (80%) than among Republicans (64%), while his job approval is also higher among people 18 years of age and older (83%) than among those younger than 18 (62%). A majority (55%) believes Obama's policies are superior to those of George W. Bush's administration.\n\nBoth measures of government effectiveness were considerably higher", "topp": "June 3, 2015\n\nLarge Majority of Americans\u2014Including Gun Owners\u2014Support Stronger Gun Safety Policies\n\nFollow-up to survey conducted following Sandy Hook shooting shows 40% of Americans say \"Guns are too easily accessible and easy for bad guys to get. It would be a lot of fun to have a gun made to look like a child's toy and shoot anyone who tries to get them.\" (August 31, 2015)\n\nSupport for stronger gun laws is across the board: between 73% and 83% of independents, Democrats, and Republicans, as well as about six-in-ten self-identified liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners.\n\nThese findings reinforce the conclusion of recent studies by the ATF's Los Angeles Field Division who found that regular rifle, handgun and shotgun buyers have accounts \"open that average about 42 firearms per year.\" (March 12, 2015)\n\nThese findings in no way suggest that making guns look like small children are necessarily a bad thing.\n\nWe are comfortable supporting the RIGHT to own and use firearms as an American Constitutional right. They are the best way to defend ourselves, our families and our friends in our times of dire need. The NRA and other anti-gun advocates either know nothing about them or simply refuse to present evidence as to why it is necessary for them to be prohibited, or some of these gun grabbers simply repeat inaccurate portrayals of guns.\n\nThese findings also show opposition to strong gun laws is rooted in underlying concerns about gun misuse.\n\nHigher Than Average Support for Second Amendment\n\nHolder Loves Second Amendment and Violence Reduction Legislation\n\nI firmly believe in the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. I believe we should embrace the history of guns, their role in society and in educating future generations. (July 29, 2014)\n\nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget (Budget 2011)\n\n\"There is simply no question that the right to bear arms is fundamental to personal security\u2026.Gun ownership increases chance of personal safety, no matter what the cost. Indeed, no fundamental right includes responsibility for one's actions.\"\n\nAntonin Scalia, 2005\n\nClarence Thomas and John Roberts point out, for good reason, that the right to bear arms is \"both a personal right, recognized in the Bill of Rights, and the basis for rational policies aimed at raising the public good, by preventing the premature use of force and discrimination.\n\nThe Framers created a right to keep and bear arms, and they understood that weapon availability was related to individual behavior. The key to a sensible gun control policy is to take a hard look at various factors \u2014 such as whether or not there is a political constituency for the particular instrument of control, which determines its frequency in the hands of the private citizen \u2014 and assess which one of these influences (government leadership, unqualified vs. qualified militia, voting motivation, persuasion, family interests, preferences, etc.) would better a policy to achieve a particular societal goal.\"\n\nAs the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, I believe that prohibiting the possession of a gun by felons and mentally ill individuals will help keep our society safe. At the same time, I also believe, that enforcement of those laws, particularly the prohibition on felony background checks, is important to maintaining public confidence in the justice system.\n\nWe must keep guns out of the hands of criminal law-breakers and dangerous individuals.\n\nBanning Hi-C\n\nThe National Center on Injury Prevention and Control recommends that all U.S. federal employees \u2013 including federal workers, professionals, and contractors \u2013 wear a bullet-resistant vest and contain a firearm in a hard case or case of any other form of protection. Some systems of an at-home device similar to a \"Hatchet\" could provide increased security to employees. In addition, a bullet-proof vest made of a ballistic nylon shell, approved for military personnel with PMA clearance, could also be used.\n\nControlled-Firearm-Protection-Bootstrap-Assistance Association (CFPA)\n\nIn November, 2006, the body that originated the CEACH protocol for injury prevention and control in the United States, Controlling and Combating Deaths through Helmets and Other Handheld Safety Equipment, released a study regarding Helmet-Holster-Evacuation-Handgun Combination. The CFPA released the report in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. By a margin of 93% to 6%, the study found that the effectiveness of modern self-contained response teams working in direct contact with active shooters was associated with the combination of the exit-protection device and a handgun.\n\nMark Barden, a CFPA member and executive director of Leatherman Canada, a leading supplier of survival gear, said, \"If guns are to be considered effective at assisting the hospital responder with fire-and-brimstone drills or rapid intervention to save a life from mass shooter scenario, stringent training, signaling devices and tactical manuals need", "human": "June 3, 2015\n\nLarge Majority of Americans\u2014Including Gun Owners\u2014Support Stronger Gun Safety Policies\n\nFollow-up to survey conducted following Sandy Hook shooting shows support for gun safety policies remains strong\n\nA large majority of Americans \u2013 including gun owners \u2013 continue to support stronger policies to prevent gun violence than are present in current federal and most state law, according to a new national public opinion survey conducted by researchers with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe survey is a follow-up to one conducted by the same researchers in early 2013, shortly after the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut that left 26 dead.\n\nThe results are published online in Preventive Medicine.\n\n\"Two years after the tragedy in Newtown, our study of public support for two dozen specific gun policies found a large majority of Americans continue to favor a range of gun-safety policies,\" says lead study author Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"Support was strongest \u2013 with little difference between gun-owners and non-owners \u2013 for universal background checks, barring people with temporary restraining orders for domestic violence from having guns and stronger regulations of licensed gun dealers.\"\n\nSupport for requiring background checks for all gun sales remained high, with 85 percent of gun owners and 83 percent of non-owners favoring the policy. In the 2013 survey, 84 percent of gun owners and 90 percent of non-owners supported background checks for all gun sales. Support for banning assault weapons among all respondents decreased from 69 percent in 2013 to 63 percent in 2015, and support for banning the sale of large capacity ammunition magazines decreased from 68 percent to 60 percent. Notably, the small erosion in support for these policies occurred almost entirely among non-gun-owners.\n\nThe 2015 national survey was conducted two years from the date the 2013 survey was fielded, and used the same sampling approach and survey research firm, GfK. The latest survey included 1,326 respondents, while 2013 survey included 2,703 participants.\n\nMore than 11,000 people in the United States are killed each year as a result of gun homicides, and the firearm homicide rate in the U.S. is seven times higher than in the average high-income country.\n\n\"The extraordinarily high rate of gun violence in the U.S. is due in large part to weaknesses in our standards for legal gun ownership and laws to hold individuals accountable if they put guns into the wrong hands,\" says study author Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \"Yet when we poll Americans, we see strong support even among gun owners for stricter standards and increased accountability.\"\n\nIn the 2015 survey, the majority of gun owners surveyed support prohibiting a person convicted of a serious crime as a juvenile from having a gun for 10 years (73 percent), prohibiting people who have been convicted of public display of gun in a threatening manner excluding self-defense from having a gun for 10 years (75 percent), and prohibiting people convicted of domestic violence from having a gun for 10 years (76 percent).\n\nSimilarly, the majority of gun owners (67 percent) also support allowing cities to sue licensed gun dealers when the gun dealer's sales practices allow criminals to obtain guns and requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a person convicted of knowingly selling a gun to someone who cannot legally have one (71 percent).\n\n\"All too often, pollsters ask Americans whether they support more or less gun control, or frame gun policies as controls on gun ownership generally rather than as measures to keep guns from criminals or other high-risk groups,\" Barry says. \"When you drill down to specific policies, you see that Americans are very much in support of common-sense regulations to keep their families and communities safe from gun violence.\"\n\n\"Two years after Newtown\u2014public opinion on gun policy revisited\" was written by Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, Emma Beth McGinty, PhD, MS, Jon Vernick, JD, MPH and Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH.\n\nThe research was supported by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg Philanthropies.

{"eta": "We headed off to the Guinea-Bissau consulate getting there about 9:30AM. There were already a few people there waiting on visas including a pastor from Dallas who had been doing door-to-door outreach to some of those detained. Once we got the visa we were on our way to the airport. There were several foreign security officers wearing red bulletproof vests with their ID badges and badges. They wanted to stop us to check our IDs but they couldn't because we had a long flight ahead of us and we were very thorough with our paperwork.\n\nWe arrived in Conakry at approximately 10AM and immediately checked in for our flight to Bissau. We arrived in Bissau at 11:15AM and turned into the police station at about 12:15PM. We were greeted at the police station by 2 officers who came over and asked to see our passports which we displayed to confirm we were still in Libya. We proceeded to submit to our searches and were required to remove our cell phones, wallets, and other items. We were then sent on our way to a place where they would take our names at random and one by one each of us would be handcuffed and taken to a large room where a magistrate would serve us some sort of detention or lengthy interrogation. I am a 20-year-old Latin American male living in New Orleans and have never been in a detention center before but I have some personal experience with the issues that have been reported in the papers here in the US: going to the police and having to submit to an interrogation and ask for your name and your biometrics as verification of identification. I have no idea where my true name will end up in the process but you must understand that everything we did was entirely lawful. They asked for our passports at least twice already and in our case the only physical verification they needed of us was if we were flying back from the country.\n\nWe were kept in a room in the room with these individuals all together and every 2-3 hours they would ask us to print our fingerprints, and also their travel documents and look it up on the screen in a spiral notebook. Some of the people had come from a variety of countries; in the US everyone had been carrying valid passports and many others with \"new\" passports already in their possession. I was of course apprehensive about the entire process being that high stakes but for the first few hours the protocol was very strict and extremely safe. Then it got a little more noisy and dramatic and I was getting very nervous. I didn't want to do anything that wouldn't take any small fraction of my free time and I didn't want to forget any documents I had, especially since many of those names were from my last trip to New Orleans.\n\nSo I simply tried to make them feel like I was going to cry if we didn't print our names right away or because we had prints but they wouldn't like that. They felt like we were trying to take away a part of them.\n\nDuring this time I also seemed to enjoy being interrogated a lot because it seemed that they wanted to make me feel out of their control but I actually didn't mind. They wanted to have me physically interact with them to see if I would bend in some way and make them better and if anyone wanted to be the chief of police or any other position that wouldn't take a year of my free time. I felt like I wanted to thank God that those in power here couldn't impose on me that same type of life.\n\nOn the 5th and 6th of July of 2014 there is an oft-told version of the story in the local newspapers in the United States wherein the president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, came to Libya and sat in Benghazi with many other Libyan leaders as the crisis was heating up and before the official attacks. He had even sent an e-mail to the president of the United States asking for help in getting us out of danger. Very early that morning the World Center in the Twin Towers went down and we needed to be evacuated out and that was when the United States invaded Libya to stop the civil war and restore order. We were not fighting the Islamic terrorists that they wanted us to and the reason we had no ill intentions was that we were all foreign fighters because we were not fighting for the sake of a religion (which we all support) but because we were all doing so for our own freedom.\n\nAs we lay down in our hospital beds on that Friday afternoon I was not angry with anyone. I wasn't angry at my government for how it turned us into enemies instead of freedom fighters but most of all I wasn't angry with people who were either civilians in our position or NATO (who had what seemed like a good intention to help the Libyan people but were just being irresponsible with military operations). I was angry with the person that hijacked our country. I wish I could tell you that he was a tyrannical monster and that there was no way to help but that isn't true.\n\n", "topp": "We headed off to the Guinea-Bissau consulate getting there about 9:30AM. There were already a few people there waiting on visas including a pastor from Dallas who owns a small bookshops in the city. The head of the Consulate told me he would be there shortly to interview the refugees and is planning to meet them and likely call on the pastor as well when they pass the visa line. The local newspaper is treating this as an important event and printing an interview with one of the islander leaders. \u00a0\nAbout a mile south of their consulate my driver told me the joint Syrian-Libyan detention center was calling. There are about a hundred or so people there but it's packed. Most people were from the Ilka region to the east and they were looking to leave as soon as possible. Some of the people in the line walked out very quickly but many stayed for hours; it was rather brutal there. A hotel was still offering rent at $150 per person, for which I believe the owner was violating his prerogative due to this confrontation. I paid $60 which is $18 per person and walked south. When I reached the island of Saba a taxi showed up and I told them I would be glad to join them for dinner as soon as possible.\nThe local embassy library is busy with books with names on them from Gulf states, Ireland and the United Kingdom. There are hotels and shops with policies for helping refugees and also temporary visas. I checked into one of the hotels and watched the smugglers with my locals for a couple of days until I got one I thought might work. I asked if there was a way of getting in. He assured me there is but that the laws are not clear on how to fly the refugees in and there isn't really a protected destination. The true beneficiaries would be located in Stuttgart and Hamburg, in Germany. A guy from Hamburg said he was willing to go by boat through the straits and make his way to Germany on a yacht. They were to pay \u20ac500 to the boat people. I can't say I'm a smuggler but I knew what he was getting himself into. \u00a0As we drove in the rain there were some in the sky looking like they might be the devil incarnate. The smugglers had their metal harnesses and even their drawings of a sail on their backs. It went on for many miles with very few stoplights. At one point they stopped talking and I stayed in the car and listened.\nThe men we would then be working for were from two different clans; Sudan and Alawite. Their names were Jalal, Abdirahman and Al-Sharif. They were proud and well-known men of this people in the Northern region of town and played fair in all dealings. They enjoyed what they did as well. What one did never meant more than the other; anyone might be a deceiver as long as they practiced their power wisely, especially such a treacherous trade. The shabbiha from the part of town who helped us, didn't seem suspicious. I even got a friend to introduce me.\nAlthough the smugglers were portrayed as unholy creatures, there were little that would make a person say, \"How could they do this to me?\" I am from one of the tribes but I haven't spoken with any on the whole island for over a week. Part of the oath dictated on the back of the passport requires a pledge to keep it all secret. Yet the local Muslim leader we spoke with said that anyone who stood by them would receive a high death sentence. Others in the village had told me they had trouble sleeping, nightmares and stopped at the camp. I have never heard of such suttee before or in Sudan for that matter. I have heard some saying you are looking for work but the men worked with absolutely no work requirements, only surplus crop (but the pay was lesser than with the government workers).\nI should note that people with family in these areas work in the Salubian region but it is heavily guarded and doesn't go to any poor neighborhoods or minorities. The women and children stayed in their own families but the men, who came on Monday mornings, would pick up odd jobs, rustic carts and fishing boats (once the locals forgot the word for boats). On several occasions I visited some of the shabbiha for small talk or to discuss holidays or some other of that kind of business. They seemed very normal as far as their ways of life; there wasn't an eccentric or violent aspect to them.\nOur latest client at the Hotel Massimo was an eight year old little girl. The long hair, bloodshot eyes, and a leather jacket became so cute at once that I was just sitting there really happy. After she was dressed in the robe a local made my head ring. I found out later she was the daughter of a Bosnian man who had worked as a fisherman for several years to pay off his family.

There were already a few people there waiting on visas including a pastor from Dallas who had come overland from Dakar. The visa was super easy, required a passport photo or passport photocopy + 20k CFA ($33.35). As we were waiting, a tour group of 60-year old American women pulls up. Guinea-Bissau seemed like an odd destination for that demographic! We had our visas in hand by 10AM.We went in search of an ATM, the one I'd used yesterday didn't work. It started drizzling as we walked around. Finally found one that worked, right next to the hotel. There was a line of people waiting and they said usually this is the ATM that didn't work!Got to GB consulate abt 9:30, pastor from Dallas, had come overland from Dakar. Very easy process, just a passport photo or photocopy of passport and 20k CFA ($33.50). Got there just in time as a tourbus full of older American and German ladies arrived to get their visas. Seems an odd demographic going to Guinea-Bissau. We had our visas in hand by 10AM.I had already spent most of my CFA so wandered around town to find a working ATM, and it started drizzling rain. Today the streets were much busier than yesterday (Sunday). Finally found a working ATM right next to the hotel, one of the guys waiting in line said this was the ATM that usually didn't work!Caught a taxi (500 CFA) to the gare routiere where ironmanjt helped negotiate a Guinea-Bissau share taxi all the way to Bissau. 38000 CFA ($63.75) for the whole taxi and we were off. This sept-place had a fabulous purple shag seats. We set off about 11:30AM. The border was only about 15kms away and we were processed through quickly. Another change of language, this time from French to Portuguese.Shag Purple Taxi, Ziguinchor-BissauThe road in Guinea-Bissau was in decent condition most of the way. Local kids were selling peeled oranges alongside the road. Definitely a poorer country than Senegal. The main official economy is peanuts and cashews. The unofficial economy is drug transit between South America and Europe.DanielW buying orangesWe arrived in Bissau about 2:30 and went to the taxi park before asking the driver to take us all the way to the hotel. He didn't know where it was so had to get a local guy to come along with us. At first they took us to the Coimbra Bar, not Coimbra hotel. I used my GPS to direct him the right way. Bissau was the dustiest capital I had seen so far. Even the main street was just bright red dust.The Coimbra hotel was the most expensive so far, $120/nt. Air con was good and wifi worked occasionally. The rain had stopped so DanielW and I decided to go out exploring a bit. The Catholic church was next door to the hotel. One thing I've noticed traveling in countries, in English-speaking countries churches seem to always be open. In Portuguese countries, churches are locked. Not sure of the reason, but all the churches we visited in Angola and Sao Tome were closed as well. The town definitely had a run-down feel. We wandered down to the port area before going into Bissau Velho (Old Bissau), a few square blocks of colorful colonial buildings.As we were wandering, some guys came up to us and asked if we wanted a boat out to the Bijagos islands. The Bijagos archipelago is one of the tourist draws, there is a ferry that is supposed to run on Fridays, returning on Sunday. Otherwise the option is by expensive (and not-so-safe) speedboats or piroges. Then asked where we were from. I said Kazakhstan (my go-to country) and the guy starts speaking to me in Russian! Go figure, he'd spent 8 years in Russia. They kept following us but finally we shook them off.Bissau, Guinea-BissauWandered past the fort (still in use by the military, so no photos!) and up to a church.

{"eta": "When I worked as a scout for the Carolina Panthers in the mid-2000s, then-coach John Fox would break up the season into quarters and set a goal to separate the starters in a month, a week, a day (or a weekend). I'd set mine to week six in March (as if not starting would hurt the team), and all the guys would perform poorly throughout my scouting position. And if I saw trouble coming in the spring, I'd order coaches to have them start the season over with a new starting quarterback, and push the competition onward. The bulk of that was Fox's idea, but it clearly helped cement an established approach.\n\nNow, I know my QB, and in August I went up against him for the Panthers' starting job. I'm going to discuss the full list of the cards the 2nd overall pick at this year's draft possesses, and determine if I agree with Mike McCoy's sentiments about Cam's development so far.\n\nWait, before I dig in, is this a done deal? I just watched Cam put up numbers like Manning did that day. Do you think he's better? And, if not, can a quarterback really teach a team, especially a team like the Seahawks?\n\nFor starters, here are your 5 1/2 card breakdowns, as each player is done with one deck:\n\nAll reviews here are my own, and not necessarily each player's rating. As usual, opinions are mine alone. My ratings are based off observations from extensive NFL training camp practices and games, but a player's overall work ethic and work on the field obviously can't be discounted. I'll also argue that development isn't dependent on NFL camps, and that young quarterbacks (as proven by Cam) are often spot-on, in some cases worse, than their pro peers.\n\nSo, it's the starting rotation and I'll attempt to dissect the cards first. Not every player can be jumped up to a starting position by a 0-3-0 track record - some even can't by a single year - but I'll try my best to address a few issues I have before I move on to discussing what Cam has done so far.\n\nThere's too much to cover here if you're looking for specific results! Rather, I'll give you my thoughts on trends: 1) This is not a lock. 2) They're maybe not - but maybe next year. 3) Maybe they're not next year. Maybe not. 4) Maybe not.\n\nQuarterback Card 1\n\nAs suggested by my review of A.J. McCarron and Johnny Manziel in the card section above, this card is designed to give Cam the QB we want him to be. I understand that it's obviously going to be difficult, but Cam's 2nd overall pick at this year's draft is simply the best receiver in the draft, and can offer this type of assist. I'm happy that the draft was partially associated with great receivers in 2012.\n\nBelow, Cam is able to force the ball out of tight coverage, and consistently adjust to the next defender (depending on positioning and position) before the ball arrives. He can make the play look so simple, it's impressive.\n\nWatch Cam do what his coach and teammates have identified is key to becoming a true #1 QB: get rid of the ball.\n\n\nWatch Cam in the opening cut-back and in the home-run formation, leaving no one to block him and converting 1st downs. He can't do this with the many guys he has to run through in his own backfield. He beats the safety at the line of scrimmage, and leaves little of a cushion to deliver the football to a running lane with guys already positioned, and not running or turning the corner to avoid contact. In addition to his ability to make these big plays at the line of scrimmage, he also is able to make the precise cuts required to be a consistent threat to take the top off a defense - especially when the play is designed for him to deliver the ball on 1st. Here, Cam pounds defensive players at the line of scrimmage, and creates 3 yards of separation as he effortlessly takes it down the field to set up the 1st down.\n\nSituation 1: Cam looks down the field, wants to keep his WR outside, and the defense focuses on DeAndre Hopkins near the 20. Cam buys the quarterback a split second to read the defense and get the ball out. This gives the quarterback time to deliver a pitch, and make the throw if the defense is on their play-side. This shows that the quarterback is willing to take the next defensive step to complete the completion. As noted previously, Cam's attempt at a pitch here is poor on this play, and allows the free rusher into the backfield, where he is able to plant his hands and reach the QB for the interception, which easily would've been intercepted by the CB if left untouched by a defender. For every 2 bad plays,", "topp": "When I worked as a scout for the Carolina Panthers in the mid-2000s, then-coach John Fox would break up the season into quarters and set a goal to make the playoffs. As always, I tried to set myself to it every year. But as it turns out, it always takes a city to get to playoffs. In 2004, Houston's markets got them there. And for many, that's all that matters \u2014 can we make it?\n\nAnd so the Houston Texans (my bosses' favorite team) refused to budge. They stayed together through the ups and downs in the rebuilding process and out of the playoffs for four straight seasons. The Texans finished as the final NFC West participant in 2006, while they ranked 21st, 25th, 31st, and 24th in the NFL in yards from scrimmage from 2008 to 2014. Their averseness has drawn comparisons to Belichick, who told SI's Peter King in 2012 that the result of the Texans situation \u2014 and his draft history \u2014 were comparable to his treatment of the New England Patriots and David Tyree in Jacksonville for years prior.\n\nOf course, comparing yourself to the Patriots, who went 12\u20134 last year, is an interesting proposition. To compliment Belichick, the Texans have Von Miller; Ben Tate; JJ Watt; Kevin Sumlin; and JJ Watt to soften his hits. And despite their roster behemoth, as long as the pass rush can count on the ability of Miller, the Texans are obviously one of the most formidable groups in the league.\n\nStill, while their emergence may be driven in part by the rising and falling on the AFC South table, it's also an expression of their dominance and resilience. And there's not even the sanguine implication of shifting their strategy from built-for-defense to lean-and-bend defenses. The Texans' tape at whatever depth they're at is far more interesting than what Tom Brady has to give.\n\nIn the SEC West, these teams figure to play each other early in the season, which enables fans to think they're in position to make a run. Oh, sure, we know that Nick Saban's Alabama, the best team in football, are 3\u20130 with plenty of confidence going into Georgia, whose impulsive head coach has shaken his team into a sense of comity, and, during Mark Richt's tenure, beat them by 24 points twice. Not to mention, Alabama has better talent to compete than any SEC team that doesn't live in the South.\n\nThere's also the Swoop side of the ledger: the importance of stockpiling 25+ number ones. Don't worry, you'll find more: this, this, and this. And since every SEC team is built up with great name recognition for this reason, there's almost no danger of a heavily competitive team's injury-ravaged roster leaving, even though most of the sides of that ledger imply a (sneaky) tumble. Conversely, we have uncertainty over whether a coaching staff has a problem with a \"likeability\" player. As the number one read below says, expect injuries and excess inventory to roil these teams \u2014 and anyone else that worries about too much on the field.\n\nTHE LAST 8\n\nSouthern Mississippi 0-3 South Alabama 3-1 Georgia 3-1 Auburn 1-3 Ole Miss 2-3 Texas A&M 3-0 Ole Miss State 1-3 Vanderbilt 0-5 Mississippi 2-3 Kentucky 4-0 Ole Miss State 0-5 Arkansas 1-3 Vanderbilt 0-5 Southeastern Louisiana 0-4 UL Lafayette 2-1 Texas State 1-3 Mississippi 0-4 Louisiana Tech 2-2 Missouri 2-2 Georgia Southern 0-3 Louisiana Tech 0-3 Arizona State 0-3 Florida International 0-3 Troy 2-2 East Carolina 1-3 Mississippi State 2-2 Georgia 0-4 Bethune-Cookman 0-3 Louisiana-Monroe 0-4 Rice 0-4 Old Dominion 0-4 Arkansas State 2-2 Ole Miss 0-4 South Carolina 0-4 Army 1-3 Indiana 0-4 Troy 0-4 Western Carolina 0-4 Louisiana-Monroe 0-4 Old Dominion 0-4 UL Lafayette 0-4 Rice 0-4 Towson 0-4 Florida International 0-3 South Alabama 0-3\n\nThe Mullensons, the Carters, the Drews, the Mazocks, the Obamas and the Boatokes took their lumps (which were divinely placed right where they were.)

The first tier through the middle looks like: Arkansas, Louisiana State, East Carolina, LSU, Michigan, North Carolina, Temple, Tennessee and Texas A&M. Game time Sunday at noon at Ole Miss on BTN.\n\nTHE OLD SPURS\n\nBU", "human": "When I worked as a scout for the Carolina Panthers in the mid-2000s, then-coach John Fox would break up the season into quarters and set a goal to achieve a 3-1 record in each to ensure a playoff berth.\n\nWhile it's probably surprising to hear losses factored into a year-long equation, Fox had the perspective to understand that a 12-4 mark would get any team into the postseason. In fact, he frequently suggested that hitting our marks at each checkpoint also would put us in prime position to secure home-field advantage as the top seed in the conference.\n\nOf course, there are a variety of factors that contribute to achieving such goals, but Fox would focus on winning the division, owning our home field (finishing with a home mark of 7-1 or better) and knocking off the top teams in the other divisions. He believed the confidence gained from defeating the heavyweights in the league would pay huge dividends in the playoffs.\n\nTo prepare for some of the challenges on the schedule, Fox routinely would have the team face the schemes of unfamiliar opponents during the offseason. Since we were in the NFC South, we were extremely familiar with Atlanta, New Orleans and Tampa Bay, but we didn't consistently face opponents in other divisions/conferences. Thus, we needed to spend extra time catching up on the playing styles that prevailed elsewhere.\n\nWith the 2014 regular season on the horizon, teams across the league are diligently studying their non-division opponents during training camp, looking to become better acquainted with the schemes and tactics that could present challenges.\n\nWith that in mind, I thought it'd be a great time to get a general feel for how the different divisions stack up -- offensively and defensively -- this season. In this file, I provide a division-by-division offensive pecking order; my defensive divisional hierarchy, of course, shook out quite a bit differently.\n\nWithout further ado, here's the offensive countdown, which I formulated by reviewing rosters and studying the All-22 Coaches Film:\n\n8) AFC South\n\nStellar quarterback play is the common denominator for the most explosive offenses in today's NFL. Therefore, it's no surprise to see the AFC South holding up the rear in these rankings. Outside of Indianapolis (where wunderkind signal-caller Andrew Luck resides), this division is fraught with QB question marks. The Jaguars are looking to tread water with Chad Henne while breaking in No. 3 overall pick Blake Bortles, the Titans are still trying to figure out what they have in injury-prone 26-year-old Jake Locker, and the Texans are planning to open the season with journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick under center. Despite the presence of quality runners on each of those teams, the lack of consistency at quarterback makes it hard to imagine this division producing multiple top-10 offenses in 2014.\n\n7) AFC East\n\nThe Patriots' vise grip on the division -- New England has taken the AFC East crown in 10 of the past 11 seasons -- stems from the excellent play of Tom Brady. The two-time league MVP is one of the few NFL quarterbacks capable of single-handedly carrying an offense while enduring a host of changes to this supporting cast. The Pats' division rivals, however, are waiting on their young quarterbacks to emerge as difference makers in the professional game. The Bills and Dolphins both possess the weapons to field top-10 units, but they need EJ Manuel and Ryan Tannehill, respectively, to make major strides. Meanwhile, the Jets clearly want second-year pro Geno Smith to be the guy, but Michael Vick continues to compete, whether he's getting a fair shake or not. If this actually evolves into a true quarterback controversy, Gang Green's offense could pay the price.\n\n6) AFC North\n\nThe AFC North's reputation for dominant defense frequently overshadows the presence of three quality starting quarterbacks within the division. While each QB has his own issues -- Ben Roethlisberger's spotty pocket discipline, Joe Flacco's inconsistency and Andy Dalton's big-game woes -- the Steelers, Ravens and Bengals all have the potential to boast a top offensive unit in 2014 because of positive quarterback play. This is particularly true in Baltimore and Cincinnati, where new offensive coordinators (Gary Kubiak and Hue Jackson, respectively) are revamping the offensive structure to maximize the talent on the roster. In Cleveland, the arrival of Johnny Manziel should give the offense a boost, but optimism remains tempered by the potential that a lengthy suspension will be handed to All-Pro receiver Josh Gordon.\n\n5) NFC West\n\nThe wild, wild West has produced the NFC's two most recent Super Bowl reps (San Francisco and Seattle), but those teams got there with stifling defenses carrying the load. Now, I know traditionalists will point out that the 49ers and Seahawks both possess potent running games, but the pass-centric nature of today's NFL during the regular season makes it hard to rank \"", "eta_suffix": " step to complete the completion.

{"eta": "Background\n\nAs a result of the Bush years and a neoconservative ideology that disproportionately favored policies curtailing the rights of Muslims domestically and interventionism on the international stage, The West's Shadow is a strong political and sociological reflection of the United Kingdom's repressed Muslim minority, almost all of whom support the establishment of an independent Islamic state.\n\nThe film is an epic in scale: it stretches from the colonial period during which the British established Muslim enclaves in India (both pre- and post-1788) to the medieval Islamic order built during the last century during the reigns of Fatimid, Abbasid, and Muhammedan emirs. A large percentage of Muslims found themselves embroiled in these conflicts. In the nineteenth century, for example, the majority of Muslim poets in Europe contributed to the development of Muslim poetry, and Muslims formed the largest group in Britain during the nineteenth century.\n\nIn this first episode of a ten-part series, Anne Barnard examines the construction of \"The West's Shadow,\" a new documentary covering the history of Muslims in Britain between 1578 and 1792. The film tracks the rise of British colonialism and the role played by European Islamic thinkers in deepening this conflict and fueling its growth into an ideology that enabled the Muslim settler communities to centralize power while minimizing their own human rights violations. It is a way into the closet of Islamic academic and social studies, and that is what makes The West's Shadow fascinating.\n\nAfrican Muslims and the West, the First Muslim State\n\nAlthough the documents that form The West's Shadow largely are from European sources, the author travels across Africa to the continent. Although the documents used to construct The West's Shadow largely exist in British archives, Barnard spent time in Ghana, Mali, Sudan, and Eritrea to investigate the subject, uncovering amazing stories of cooperation and identity that resonate powerfully in Africa. \"The West's Shadow\" will transport you back to the beginning of the twentieth century where all African Muslims, then living in colonial slums, supported the British imperial enterprise:\n\nAt the beginning, the European expatriates were also Muslim, and Muslim communities were growing fast in major European cities. But until the late 1860s, religion had been a secondary part of social life. In the midst of this turmoil, tens of thousands of Europeans migrated in search of work. In this time, millions of Muslims discovered the West and its backwardness and wanted to flee the country, but at the same time were used as tools of the colonial authorities. Many felt disenfranchised, and few were granted freedom of religion as expatriates: the Arabs were treated like foreigners from a Muslim country.\n\nAlthough Muslim communities in the West are diverse, The West's Shadow is not concerned with their \"accidental\" connection to Islam and other cultures, and the primary focus of the film is on their attraction to the British world and their opposition to Islamization.\n\nBarnard encounters well-meaning colonial educators and administrators, but in doing so, she discovers the abject failure of Islamic apologetics, the tendency of these groups to persuade themselves in the face of dire evidence that their opposition to Islamization is totally justified. With the introduction of Islamization as a political ideology in the twentieth century, it becomes clear that the only explanation for the embrace of Western culture, education, and even modernity by the predominantly Muslim, immigrant communities in Britain is that Christianity is a perverse threat that must be quelled by violence. They attempt to attack the \"Hindu agenda,\" while they themselves actively seek to occupy a religious and political space that we define as a \"Western\" space.\n\nNot only is the claim that Europeans were not great Christians made by later British and French \"defence\" historians in The West's Shadow of shallow and false; it is an alibi not only for the colonial achievement of secularizing Europe in the nineteenth century. It is as though the West is somehow on the verge of being infiltrated by an alien race, and the European colonized communities are trying to repel the alien invaders with violence, as if they are resisting an external invader. The notion that Europeans could live peacefully in a Europeanized Muslim world is debunked with this \"evidence,\" along with a slander that Muslim poverty is completely similar to that of Western poor.\n\nBarnard eventually reaches a conclusion that the nature of identity within the Muslim diaspora is not primarily Islam. He notes that \"there are no observations that provide evidence for the claim that any community is a new Christian community,\" whereas \"there are indications that the tradition of subordination and sectarianism between believers is still evident in the Muslim world,\" and that \"the Muslim identity that Muslim leaders express is one of power and privilege rather than one of liberation and freedom.\" However, most of Barnard's analysis is situated in anti-Christian sub-Saharan Africa, and the often-oppressive culture that it adopted as a result of imperialism \u2014 specifically the British colonial system.\n\nNonetheless, Barnard emerges with an encycl", "topp": "Background\n\nAs a result of the Bush years and a neoconservative ideology that disproportionately favored policies curtailing the rights of Muslims domestically and interventionism on the international stage, Muslims were a convenient scapegoat and the Iraq invasion was a necessary step in that process. For him, a Muslim misfortunes that could have been prevented were now to be partially covered up.\n\nKelley Brown writes,\n\nThe machinations against Iraqi troops went beyond justifying deposing Saddam Hussein; they involved triggering a domestic refugee crisis and martial law\u2014an idea championed by Christian and Conservative MPs and journalists\u2014in order to achieve national security goals. They also included deliberating the expulsion of any Iraqi \u2013not to mention many other minority groups, including the Shia Muslims \u2013 who might attack Iraq and thereby threaten to undermine efforts to oust the Bush administration.\n\nFurther, the horror of the 9/11 attacks were used to justify a U.S. invasion while painting Arabs, Muslims and others as suspicious of America. However, this was really a war of theft: The U.S. bought the war and justified the invasion on the grounds that it was justified by al-Qaeda.\n\nIraq's Vast Networks of Darknet Trading\n\nBesides aiding in the terrorist attacks, it is likewise believed by many that the Iraq war was intended to generate revenue for the U.S.\n\nFor example, 9/11 helped sell Iraq (along with Iran and North Korea) to the West, thereby increasing the threat of war and further easing U.S. regulations.\n\nWith a large population of drug trafficking and currency trading locations within Iraq, the countries regularly lose large sums of currency and many more tons of gold due to the criminal networks that thrive within Iraq (via drug trafficking and aggressive economic policies).\n\nMore goods needed by the West (most notably, inexpensive foodstuffs) depend on the usual economic policies of Iraq that is burdened with a difficult political climate due to the insurgency and a lack of access to energy resources. As a result, high dollar markets drive profits in the illegal industries and demand that everyone subscribe to the business \u2013 among them these sectors of Syria and Russia (in order to survive).\n\nWhen people in the West demand prices to rise and will take on tough actions if they cannot, such regimes will have to resort to seemingly brutal measures to push up the price.\n\nOne such policy is imposing high taxes on the oil sector in Libya in order to support its Arab-backed government.\n\nIraq Debt Crisis\n\nAnother war-induced concern of the 9/11 hit was the debt-heavy nation of Iraq, including the $200-billion-plus of debt accumulated before the invasion in 2003. By 2003, the country owed other countries $150 billion ($130 billion at that point), which the U.S. certainly did not care about: It loaned the country funds to secure a position on the international scene so that it could be responsible for ensuring the continuation of the geopolitics that took place in the name of a war with the \"Sheiks of Evil\".\n\nDuring this time, the entire currency of Iraq was severely devalued. This necessitated that the commercial world around Iraq, even the nation-state itself, would charge higher prices because many other countries had stopped lending. For example, Iraq was one of the last countries in the West to approve a swap for Saudi Arabia's Sahu oil, which despite the fact that the rate was reduced to 13 cents a barrel by the start of 2002 is the price charged for Iraqi oil as of the U.S. decision of October 13, 2002. After Saddam had taken advantage of his fate to make Iraq's oil extremely scarce, the country's government spent all the tax money it raised from oil sales on interest payments to Western-dominated banks, which meant the value of the city of Mosul fell to $375 million (C$2.6 billion).\n\nOf course, if one is in need of food, gasoline or goods of all kinds, then it does not really matter how the price increases as the Middle Eastern crisis is forcing other peoples into the same error. Consequently, even if a Sunni Arab in Iraq or Syria is desperate for an explanation, only one can actually blame the United States:\n\nSometimes, when they arrived, it looked like you were the smartest person on the street because the majority of your friends were also strangers. These strangers believed those stranger noises were being made by us.

This affiliation came to the forefront in the 2004 Presidential Election when 76% of American Muslims supported John Kerry while only 7% supported President George W. Bush. Having been a historically Republican voting bloc, the political realignment exhibited by American Muslims was so drastic that John Zogby characterized it as \"virtually unprecedented\" at the time. American Muslim support for the Democratic Party intensified during the 2008 Presidential Campaign, as 89% of American Muslims voted for then-candidate Barack Obama. Four years later, President Obama's re-election campaign was widely supported, again, with a nominally lower 85% support from the American Muslim community, a number nearly identical to those who formally affiliated as ideologically liberal.\n\nThe Muslim community's political realignment has not only been evident in the context of presidential elections, but is also on full display vis-\u00e0-vis contributions and volunteer hours for liberal democrats, Facebook posting and re-tweeting of liberal politician and pundit statements, along with shifting opinions within the American Muslim community on topics such as gay marriage, evolution, abortion, and related topics. This dynamic is what I have termed \"the liberal alliance\" which represents the political, social, and ideological commitment to liberalism, which American Muslims have and continue to make en masse.\n\nAs of late, political discussions in the American Muslim community have placed this relationship under the microscope, with critics centering on President Obama's domestic and foreign policies that have, in large part, not been a significant departure from that of his neoconservative predecessor. In fact, a number of his policies have been systemically worse, engendering a bipartisan consensus around issues that were historically viewed as uniquely conservative. Military interventionism, curtailment of domestic freedoms, and protections for Wall Street executives and firms guilty of fiscal malfeasance stand today as the prevailing positions of both Democrats and Republicans alike, with rare exception.\n\nGiven this reality, the question begs itself as to what American Muslims should reasonably do \u2013 if indeed the best chance for political viability is uncritical support for a party whose platform is virtually identical to its counterparts (at least in regards to core 'Muslim' issues such as domestic surveillance, indefinite detention, Guantanamo Bay, interventionism, Israel/Palestine, etc.) then is it really worth participating at all? Should Muslims 'throw away their vote' and cast ballots for third-party candidates that have no chance for victory?\n\nRed/Blue Dichotomy\n\nPerhaps the first component of this discussion that needs addressing is the simplistic nature of political engagement that has dominated Muslim communities for the better part of the last decade. Though not uniquely Muslim, the tendency to view politics as a blue/red proposition is, without question, problematic. In this framing, Republicans are frequently caricaturized as representing the worst that their party has to offer, whilst Democrats are brandied as 'pro Muslim', in seeming ambivalence to said candidates' public statements and voting record.\n\nMuslims need to realize that the red/blue dichotomy is a false one, and that political debates are little more than theatrics that depend on factors above and beyond substance. Journalists, political pundits, and candidates frequently employ what is termed manufactured outrage by taking a perspective that is nominally different than their opponents but presenting the two sides as being representative of a deep philosophical divide. The utility in doing so is that it provides the illusion of real debate while implicitly structuring what constitutes politically permissive discourse.\n\nLike this? Get more of our great articles. Get more of our great articles.\n\nAccordingly, the strictures of permissive political discourse work to marginalize alternative voices as fringe or otherwise eccentric while yielding a citizenry that is largely obedient, a dynamic Chomsky articulated when he said,\n\nThe smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum \u2013 even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.\"\n\nIn addition, American Muslims need to view politicians for who they are \u2013 politicians, not friends, family, or community members. Politicians are rarely principled enough to be 'pro-Muslim' or 'anti-Muslim', rather they are apt to act on that which is politically expedient at a given point in time. The fact that certain members of the Democratic Party and liberal establishment advocate on behalf of Muslim causes has more to do with a shared political adversary than a common moral/ethical paradigm.\n\nThis is even more so when it comes to political commenters and satirists.

{"eta": "Welcome to the third part of this year's Trade Value series. If you haven't already, read the intro and get yourself acquainted with what question this is trying to answer, before reading.\n\nLast week we took a look at the beginning of the 2017-18 season: who were the winners and losers of trades and who had the highest re-signings ($mil or more) from the past four seasons. Today we will take a closer look at who was the most valuable to their team over the course of the season:\n\n1. Boston Celtics\n\nBoston had the best team salary-wise for the entire season, while being the most expensive team in terms of total value (minus players). Not surprisingly, Boston's 2016 first round Draft pick held a whopping $12,210,927.\n\nThe Celtics' 2015 first round Draft pick held a whopping $6,083,058\n\nJohn Collins will be paid millions on a 5-year deal this summer\n\nThe 2018-19 Celtics Draft pick holds a laughable $13,000,000. The current rightsholder to this contract and its adjustment has been not-for-sale Angel Long. Long's contract on a one year option would pay him $16.5 million. Not bad for a player that comes over to the Celtics with over 3 years of experience and probably is itching to get his salary.\n\nThe 2018-19 Celtics will get 2017-19 All-Star Kelly Olynyk for essentially next to nothing (emphasis on almost-nothing). Boston fans should not be cheering much for Olynyk's success this season, as his per-game average production will be in the mid six figures. Boston did sign Goran Dragic to a five year $97 million free agent extension with the Heat, so who knows if we'll ever see some success for Dragic with his brother in the backcourt?\n\n2. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nThis year's Sixers improved their salary cap situation even more with the addition of Salah Mejri (listed at $6,390,000), who was essentially traded for the rights to Kosta Koufos. Philadelphia also traded away Ben Simmons, but added to that core for the next two seasons, acquiring Nerlens Noel along with the promise of adding Jrue Holiday to a starting unit that already includes Joel Embiid and the young Carter-Williams.\n\nThe Celtics were also able to add cap space in trading for John Collins ($3,980,000) and Lou Williams ($12,749,000). The next time Sixers fans start moaning about \"The Embiid Lineup\" forget about it, as all they're going to be saying about Philadelphia's defense at this year's deadline will come at the expense of their own.\n\nPhiladelphia also made a few additions via free agency, bringing in Nerlens Noel ($20,000,000) and Jahlil Okafor ($11,083,391).\n\nThe Sixers ended up with 2016 1st round draft pick Ben Simmons ($16,104,559) in a trade with the Boston Celtics, who also received the 2016 1st round draft pick that Philadelphia acquired in the Sixers trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n3. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nThe Thunder also finished with nearly double the annual payroll of the next team on this list, with $183,298,285. Even with a big salary increase, Oklahoma City's team salary appears to be taking a hit through this year and the risk of their players being injured or injured suffering injuries as the season progresses is more risky for the Thunder than a lot of other teams.\n\nThe $68,916,834 Thunder's 2017 1st round draft pick held a team salary of $18,305,285, and would be worth $51,000,000 if the Thunder kept it.\n\nThe 2018 1st round draft pick held a team salary of $17,585,825, and would be worth $46,500,000 if the Thunder kept it.\n\nThe team's 2018 1st round draft pick held a team salary of $7,703,351 and would be worth $7,708,500 if the Thunder kept it.\n\nThe pick itself held a team salary of $3,893,161 and was worth only $2,999,402 if you kept it.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder hold the rights to their 2018 first round draft pick, which should be worth $15,000,000, once again taking into account the risk and risk factors relating to the players in OKC's stable.\n\nOklahoma City also traded their 2018 1st round draft pick for Kendrick Perkins, which was effectively worthless. Perkins was an undrafted free agent and will likely be lucky to ever make it past training camp, so that's a high price to pay for a young player with virtually no chance of making it to the NBA.\n\n4. Golden State Warriors\n\nThe Warriors", "topp": "Welcome to the third part of this year's Trade Value series. If you haven't already, read the intro and get yourself acquainted with what question this is trying to answer, what it's trying to get at, and a little about the set we're talking about. Either way, let's get to it.\n\nWhat makes the Legends set great for some is not the creatures, but the fact that it's constructed in such a way to break down all the individual cards and use the values of each to tell the story of each set. If someone as critical to understanding Legends is looking to understand the Value of the set, the Return to Ravnica/Dragon's Maze sets are the perfect place to start.\n\nLet's Get Down to Business\u2026\n\nIt all starts with the Fallen Empires booster, and from there we'll go in many different directions. There are a lot of cards and storyline/plot points within Legends that jump off the page right away. As I mentioned before, we jump straight into the weird universe that the\u2014creepy eyed, reeking monstrosity that is the Dragon Plate\u2014is trying to travel to, but if you know the basics of Fallen Empires, and the other sets that took place in it, you'll be more than able to fill in the gaps. Let's start off with the simplest and simplest plot point\u2014Are we all one big family or are we one main tree?\n\nGood question. As pointed out in the previous article, the putative \"good\" friend who helps head our short twisted journey might be the extended branch, and it's interesting, but it does feel like a lot of filler. Luckily the overarching story helps out tremendously with this. Maybe the whole list is just that we've all got the same problem with the human race, and that we can't all do as good a job and improve it, but moving on.\n\nThat leads us to the one card that differs the most from every other card in the set. This gets a little complicated, but the general gist is that the key about what the history of the world is, both mythic and modern.\n\n\"Don't give me that hippy crap.\"\n\nThat's right, the one card that fights against all the other theing and hatred is here and specifically it's the special item Nissa can only grab when her brother is in combat (the reason why the expansion symbol is actually there). This is of course getting at the tenets of the creation myth. After the redemption of Nissa by Shining Blade, the Zendikari were redeemed and allowed to control this world. That's a prevalent theme in the story, but it's a contradiction to this world that many call the prodigal's rainy day.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Ravnica's Song of Life, Zendikar's dream of balance is also a reinforcement of how the Zendikari are free of inequality, but also more than that, a reminder that in this new world we do not adhere to the ideals and laws of our ancestors, but we strive to be as good as we can be.\n\nPart of that thing's also that, perhaps, the perception is wrong of the Dragons and humans of Progenitus. That's a hard thing to do given their history\u2014getting chosen as Planeswalkers by both beings who also wish to control Progenitus. While this does happen (perhaps unwittingly), while this day might be over, it remains the tradition. That's a theme we've covered a lot in the past and can do so in the context of this list.\n\nThe polar opposite of Revoke Existence is Return to Ravnica's name: National Treasure. In a climate where the old world is feared by outsiders, a series of powerful artifacts that help build communities are known by the rather puny and all but useless National Treasure. This lends itself well to a list of things humans should not do, because why would anyone want to drive an old one so far away from home and to such an old, strange, almighty library?\n\nIt's a theme that borrows a little from Ugin's Cascade, in the sense that it's given a great deal of power and influence to the development of the new world (and even newer) ideals. This lesson needs to apply to this day (last week), too: we all love things for their fair, easy price tag, but once and for all (or at least for a short while), living in this new world requires sacrifices.\n\nThis feeling of giving and taking as the \"greater good\" isn't unique to just Rise of the Eldrazi, but it does aid in the theme of the set. That said, I'll leave it at that because I feel like there's a lot more to digest here.\n\nAnyway\u2026So, that did that. We found out how the world of Progenitus is built and some of what humans have done to it.", "human": "Welcome to the third part of this year's Trade Value series. If you haven't already, read the intro and get yourself acquainted with what question this is trying to answer, as well as an incomplete list of guys who missed the cut for one reason or another. You can see all the posts in the series here.\n\nDue to popular demand \u2014 or maybe unpopular outrage? \u2014 this post and the next two will revert back to the prior year's format of listing each player individually, with a blurb beneath them, rather than the article format that I experimented with in the first two posts. The mob has spoken.\n\nA few quick notes on the columns listed for each player. After the normal biographical information, I've listed Projected WAR, which is essentially a combination of ZIPS and Steamer's current rest-of-season forecasts extrapolated out to a full-season's worth of playing time. For non-catcher position players, this is 600 plate appearances; catchers are extrapolated to 450 PAs. For pitchers, this is extrapolated to 200 innings. It is not their 2014 WAR, or their last calendar year WAR; it is a rough estimate of what we might expect them to do over a full-season, based on the information we have now.\n\nFor contract status, we have two pieces of information. \"Controlled Through\" includes all years before a player accumulates enough time to be eligible for free agency, all guaranteed years of a contract already signed, and any years covered by team options that could be exercised in the future. Player options and mutual options are not included, as the assumption is that players of this caliber will generally opt-out of their current contracts if given the chance.\n\nThe \"Contract Dollars\" column includes the base salaries of each player in the controlled years going forward, starting from 2015 \u2014 the 40% of 2014 salary remaining is not included in the calculation \u2014 including the value of team options, since we're assuming that they will be picked up. In many cases, players have incentives for various accomplishments that affect the base salaries, but those are not accounted for here, simply because of the tedious work of calculating all those incentive prices and the fact that $100,000 for an All-Star appearance or $500,000 for an MVP-finish there aren't going to change the overall calculations. This column is not an exact representation of their future earnings, but should be close enough for our purposes.\n\nFor players who are under team control but not under guaranteed contract, I've listed out which arbitration years they still have remaining. There are a few players who have both guaranteed contracts and arbitration eligibility remaining, but we'll deal with those cases in the article when a simple line in the chart doesn't explain their situation perfectly.\n\nFinally, \"Last Year\" notes where a player was ranked on this list last year, or if he wasn't on the 2013 Trade Value series, then he is denoted as unranked. As you can imagine, there's a lot more turnover at the end of the list than the beginning.\n\nNow, for the middle section of the list.\n\nRank Name Age Team Position Projected WAR Controlled Through Contract Dollars Last Year 30 Gregory Polanco 22 PIT OF 1.5 2020 Pre-Arb \u2013 Arb3 Unranked\n\nPolanco is the kind of player that every team covets; a useful contributor in the big leagues right now with enough upside to dream on what he could become in a few years. The mix of short-term and long-term value, combined with three and a half years of something close to league minimum salaries, make Polanco the kind of player that would generate trade interest from every single team in baseball.\n\nIt has to be noted, though, that Polanco's short-term value was probably overstated in the backlash against the Pirates decision to leave him in the minors in order to avoid Super Two status. His power is still more projection than present day reality, and a 73% contact rate is not a great number for a guy who isn't crushing the ball when he does make contact. History is littered with busted prospects who were supposed to hit for power and never did, and so while Polanco's overall promise is enticing, he does come with a substantial amount of risk.\n\nOf course, Polanco was crushing the ball in Triple-A, and he's young enough that even holding his own at the big league level is an accomplishment. With a few more years of development, he should turn into one of the game's best outfielders. He's just not quite there yet, which is why he's hanging out in the same range as the other prospects on the list, even though he's technically not a prospect anymore.\n\nRank Name Age Team Position Projected WAR Controlled Through Contract Dollars Last Year 29 Kris Bryant 22 CHC 3B 2.8 TBD Pre-Arb \u2013 Arb3 Unranked\n\nSpeaking of prospects that belong in the big", "eta_suffix": " traded their 2018 1st round draft pick for Kendrick Perkins, which was effectively worthless.

{"eta": "By Emma S\n\nIn late 2014, to help a friend, I joined the team of Wander, the non-combat, exploration MMO, volunteering to help with mundane things. I'm not sure if this is because I'm lucky or because my managers allowed it \u2013 but I did it anyway! All I could think was that I couldn't do this alone.\n\nSince the beginning of 2015, we've gained a lot of new players and have developed into a dev team! Unfortunately, because we started with small (simple) features, and worked (solved) time-by-time over the years, we didn't receive much feedback on our project, which is a consequence as much as our ideas! It's rather sad, for sure, but we would rather focus on fixing up our code, and make some improvements there, than go to open beta.\n\nAnyway, in the early weeks, Wander felt more polished than some of the other recent MMORPGs I've played\u2026 I thought it was cute, I was just surprised, not that I really enjoyed it, but also that we are not just waiting for the cash-sales of a few multimillion-dollar-at-last MMO (but the development version will let us!).\n\nYet, after 6 months, it's pretty far advanced from the feedback of the early players. With regards to marketing and key areas, there has been a lot of good feedback from the early players \u2013 I am certain the budget for Wander will enable us to acquire enough press to bring you the game, not just a single huge feature update\u2026\n\nNevertheless, something is not right.\n\nFirst of all, even though we are putting on an amazing marketing and marketing team, we've been waiting for some months, even before I started working with the team at DreamHack Valencia, to be able to actually receive any feedback on our concept. You know, know our big ticket (or one of) features, that will give Wander a huge boost in revenue and will prove its longevity \u2013 and get players in more of an excitement! We got some of them, but no one on the team or the company could offer tangible comments or insight. Not sure what they are or would ever think about the game. I really expected to come across something, to hear one single \"yes\".\n\nAfter DreamHack, we talk again with the managers of Wander to find out everything that needs to be done. We know this one feature that's relevant to the game we are working on today, that's not a filler. While there were other features, that still need refinement, such as party-based melee combat, the ones that were short of time and were unforeseeable was probably some of the delayed features: plot and progression, dungeons, pets. We are not sending these to the dev team to be added to the game, however, so that we can start over. If our chances of success were higher, we would move towards an to-do list, to address as much as possible. In contrast, if we kept playing our cards right then \u2013 it would be a long time until we could actually experience a big feature, let alone run it, solve it or even show it to players!\n\nI could really do another blogpost about this project, so let's look at the structural problem that needs to be fixed: you don't really need to try Wander to understand why it's so important.\n\nThere are several articles on how to go to a fancy part of the town and defeat the Ancient Dungeon Bosses, but they only mention how. They don't mention the core part which is: you have to gain access to an area of ruins. This only matters if you are going to open some kind of dungeon, as much as it would even be useful to ignore the plot.\n\nWhy not tell what that area is? Wander's main character is a tree, he runs around, drops cool weapons if you fight him in that area, if you collect a key (which won't be very easy to come by). Here's the plot of Wander, in an overview; from an inventory screen: \"You must find a key to open this chest. A key will show an Adventurer in it's chest. You can fight him, who will ask you to retrieve his own key and tell the key is necessary\". If you discover three places to run or bypass the chest, you can just jump to a newly discovered location and explore it \u2013 but only if the place has this object/item/object of interest (which,, for example, all dungeon entrances have!)\n\nSo, what if you come across a chest with something to give to the Ancient Dungeon Boss? Try to open it? What if another one arrives? If you try to fight the Ancient Dungeon Boss, what are you doing \u2013 knowing the Plot? What will happen if it's of little importance and the player just needs to steal it? How will he have the Key to open it? Do you know if", "topp": "By Emma S\n\nIn late 2014, to help a friend, I joined the team of Wander, the non-combat, exploration MMO, volunteering to help with mundane things like playing Knights of Pen & Paper and making sure the servers didn't crash. I'd played by then, and liked it. I wanted to try it again, despite the fact that I was broke. In the first days I used some services I'd found online, which involved agreeing to pay the upfront costs for the privilege of being granted an account for free. I had faith I would find some obscure trading exploits and, having lived in Paris for the better part of a decade, knew that one day I'd want to visit the living room of the glorious Georgian city.\n\nSome of those pirated eBay items I possessed were nothing of the sort. The buildings weren't heart-shaped. For the most part, they resembled trees. A few had cafes attached. Some even had beautiful bird-watching. But they weren't like any which I'd ever seen.\n\nThe city was a monumental idea \u2013 the world of a visually arresting and mind-blowingly charming city where justice and obligation lay at the centre of a colonial morality play. There were constant wars, of course,, but they were wholly consistent, more like mindless cock fights than military engagements. Out of the better-established colonial powers, the French had only recently embraced anti-slaves and anti-authoritarian revolution. And yet it felt genuinely new to me. \"A new world indeed,\" lamented a wall-mounted picture of the city in the market square. \"A world where men are free to do anything, whatever their humanity.\"\n\n\"Despite the horrors, San Cristobal was still a haven,\" a Post Adventure guide would recount after travelling to the capital. \"I met scientists and castouts. A hotel girl worked in our city. After a few months I decided to marry her.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Designer Noda Kaneko modelling Los Angeles in Wander. Photograph: Adrian van der Spek\n\nI wasn't alone: leading a tour group from one end of the city to the other we began a conversation about the city's beauty. I asked them what conditions resembled the best parts of the real city, and they laughed. It felt already familiar.\n\nKaneko, the multiplayer designer who helped conceive of Los Angeles, remembered a massively multiplayer game based around street samurai fought over a lava pit being played by a small group of Japanese players in Paris.\n\nBut the abstract representations of parks, trees, buildings, houses and \"maps\" in Los Angeles stung. They made LA feel like a vision, a replication of a fantasy, something only some odd nerds could have hoped for. I'd come to LA a week earlier, after months of searching for spaces within the city and being woken early on the morning of a sunny Saturday to a taste of the Golden Gate Parkway at dawn.\n\nWander's denizens weren't working the streets like that. For me, wandering through Venice was and still is an idealisation of LA, to be learned and understood for its imperfections and brilliance as a city rather than to be celebrated for its pristine beauty. Indeed, the sight of the gleaming city through its pre-dawn, protective darkness\u2013the real light of the city and the coherence of its metropolitan space\u2014would be an event destined to always ring false. I wanted LA to have lived up to that promise.\n\nWell, maybe not. I wandered down Broadway for a while and returned on my bike to friends. This sort of thing is the price of living in LA. Going home in the evening on a Friday evening as the city lights began to flame through Nob Hill, Venice Beach, and Folsom wasn't the usual crime thing to do, or to look like the best-dressed guy in town. But to be in the city as it still is, as the memorial to the larger infrastructure and the public institutions and activities that shape our way of life, and to see the city fresh again, to look at the world around you and wonder how it works, was a thrill. It was a city with the capacity to surprise and delight.\n\nAt the end of my autumn trip to LA, I had a little progress. I still had to make for a hostel, but my initial ideas about Los Angeles as a sandbox had begun to return. I could envisage the game in its present state as a full, bustling urban ecosystem. Like a cross between a pile of thousands of pamphlets on what happened after the letter \"U\" to Japan exploded and a jumble of papers from an entire school programme describing the magical school sanctuary of Oshoboko, Japan, where that bomb exploded. At the centre, here, were all the variations in real LA, built for the purpose of living the city's fantasies, or simply to exist in its milieu.\n\nI returned home somewhat saddled with the knowledge of Tokyo's labyrinth", "human": "By Emma S\n\nIn late 2014, to help a friend, I joined the team of Wander, the non-combat, exploration MMO, volunteering to help with mundane things like filling out paperwork and maybe playing the game a little to check out a few features. Nothing serious, I thought. I didn't know that I'd soon be called in to help more often, to be company during work periods that would run late into the night, to be the in-house tester for the game, and to manage its growing player community.\n\nI also didn't know, then, that Wander would soon (and I hoped briefly) be made notorious by players calling it \"the worst game on PS4 ever.\"\n\nI don't have a background in game development or even public relations, but I am a gamer. I have a long history of playing MMOs, from World of Warcraft to really obscure Korean MMORPGs, and I'm not bad with a sniper rifle in an FPS. But at the time Wander launched, after spending six years at university on multiple science degrees, I was looking to embark on a PhD or medical school. A lot of the other team members weren't from a games background either, which has made the development of Wander more of an adventure, but also at times incredibly tough.\n\nWander is definitely a niche game: it's an MMO without fighting, XP, money, or a quest system, where your task is simply to wander through the landscape and discover the game's world and story at your leisure. My first impression was that it was most definitely beautiful, and also different\u2014not for everyone, but something I believed would find a place in the heart of a certain kind of gamer. Even in extremely early development, when we were still using the Unity engine, Wander was enchanting and incredibly immersive, especially on the Oculus Rift. I helped push for the decision to move Wander to CryEngine, which I think benefited the game immeasurably.\n\nI worked side-by-side with the incredibly small, Melbourne-based Wander team (a core team of less than 10 people, three of whom were full-time) though long nights, getting excited when we made something work, and annoyed when it seemed like we failed Sony's TRC (technical requirements checklist) for silly things like bugs we thought we'd fixed but had appeared again. I often wrangled two or three of our four PS4 devkits simultaneously for testing, and seldom had anyone to help me.\n\nAs the release date approached, nerves kicked in. Having to pass the TRC to meet the release deadline put us under considerable pressure. I started to doubt whether we'd make our deadline. I stressed about how our latest build was going to perform and, more generally, what the future would hold for the game. We were working towards bold, even ludicrous goals. How, I wondered, would a tiny indie studio made up of such a motley crew make a game on par with a AAA title from studios with hundreds of people and money we couldn't even dream of? But I believed in Wander and its principles, so I tried to stay optimistic. I grit my teeth and kept working.\n\nThe Release-Day Hatestorm\n\nThen came release day. At that point, I took over looking after social media, as the person dealing with it was already multitasking like a goddamned boss. Jesus Christ. It was beyond stressful. As I'd never done social media management or PR before, this was insanity for me.\n\nIt always went without saying that Wander would never be a mainstream hit like the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Witcher series. What we didn't anticipate was that its idiosyncrasy would combine with a host of unforeseen launch-day bugs to bring down a storm of hate on the game, and thus the team.\n\nNever underestimate the tremendous wrath of an immeasurable horde of irate gamers. Within half an hour of launch, Facebook and Twitter had exploded with incredibly nasty comments. Though they were horrible, they were also honest. I hit the ground running. I read and answered every single post and comment as it came though. My stomach sank further with each passing notification. I felt was like I was being punched from the inside with every new comment.\n\nWe had an incredible number of error and bug reports, particularly for the PS4 version. We would soon discover that 97% of the crashes players were experiencing on that platform were due to a single line of code that was responsible for logging, which hadn't been seen during the testing phase.\n\nI was shocked by the volume of feedback. My anxiety levels would surge every five minutes as new complaints emerged. On one hand I had disappointed fans, who had been eagerly awaiting Wander's release for months, and on the other, new players (justifiably) demanding refunds or venting their outrage.

Against Boratev in the third cycle, PuMa claimed a 15\u20130 victory. He created some controversy in November 2015 by bowing out against MC in the RO32, with the winner of the event paying his opponent money. Despite his losses, PuMa has returned to form in 2016, becoming a resident force in the Proleague and continuing to produce in Top 3, but notably losing to Life in the Playhem Finals for his third place finish. He was also a 2015 DreamHack champion, where he was 3\u20130 against Life in the Grand Finals.\n\nWings of Liberty [ edit ]\n\nIn December of 2013, PuMa was a sub for Lions, Team Liquid's progamer.[1] PuMa used to play Protoss in Legacy of the Void.[2] He moved over to Zerg in May of 2014, replacing Shakuras in Lions,[3] and participated in the ESET French Open KR Season 1. He was placed in the Winners Bracket, where he lost 0\u20132 to VespAS on the first day, but defeated sosik with an initial evocate and Korok, proving that he could play a macro game while the Brood Lord lurked outside of the game and react quickly.[3] He qualified for GOMTV StarLeague Season 1-4 and would go on to win his first important match in GSL Code A, defeating Life in the winners' match on Day 2. When DreamHack Winter 2015 took place, PuMa was placed in the Winners' Bracket where he lost to Solar and then Neeb, beating them both consecutively on Day 2 to make it into the Round of 16. In the Round of 32, PuMa faced Neeb again and was again sent to Losers' Round 1, where he was dispatched 4\u20131, dropping down to the Round of 16. His chances for a Code S spot were greatly hampered and he was subsequently released from Team Liquid. At the end of August, PuMa had been picked up by the also Korean team, Wings Gaming.[4] The Terran then played for Lions for this season, in a team whose main purpose was to showcase his build-order positioning and call out teammate's mistakes as they made it to the grand finals. However, his run was cut short by Moon in the grand finals.\n\nOne month later, PuMa transferred back to Lions and placed fifth in the 2015 premier league, moving on to play in the 2016 GomTV StarLeague. Like Lions, his team was led by Max by now, although if you look closely, there's a significant difference: PuMa used to play Protoss in Wings, while Max used to play Zerg (or it seems for Max, rather, a Protoss version of Zerg in Wings). Max drew PuMa in the 2011 GSL Playoffs while Sun needed to win the GSL Season 1, where he lost to Neeb in the finals.\n\nPuMa participated in the GOMTV A-League season 1 but lost 1\u20133 against unknown teammate HoeJJa. A month later, he took part in the 2015 SPOTV MOBA Cup. He came in ninth place on the Dutch team whereas his teammate HoeJJa lost to GuMiho in the first round. PuMa's record in the HOBA Cup will never be broken, but one of his strengths is his ability to out-macro players; he defeated a number of players that had top handicap 10s, especially HoeJJa. He dropped to second place by the end of March, losing 0\u20133 in the group stages against then weak opponents such as Denial eSports and Beyond the Summit, thus qualifying for Code S.\n\nOn July 24, 2017, PuMa was announced as one of the finalists for the 1st ever 23+ Player World Tournament; he was invited by Drunkenboi to represent his country of South Korea.

I called my dad and we took him to the hospital, which is where his death was brought to our attention. We brought him some ashes and saved his life through our efforts to take some of the scrap iron into the mountains.\n\nThe boys came to us to tell us that after they fell, they knew exactly where and how their bodies had been found.

His mother eventually returned to a state of mind that is called \"sober.\"\n\nSeymour writes that the family doesn't feel any connection to the community.

I graduated from high school and went back home for a few months in the fall. We were both the junior in high school, and we were actually in the very early stages of developing good friendship. It was a good time to have friendship.\n\nI was one of just 2 or 3 young people in high school out of 50 in our class living on our own. It was odd to me that everyone else in school was the \"fucky ones\" just like me. Our case was unusual: we made two payments to the Salvation Army while living off of charity donations from our parents. We were good students.

Photos by Ryan Grace, on behalf of Conservation Canadian.\n\nIn 1978, a similar event occurred at Don Creek, Colorado. An eighteen-acre landfill was built there and an oil refinery to feed that landfill was built adjacent to it, which has since been decommissioned.\n\nIn addition, Calgary, Alberta also had a huge methane mine within its boundaries that was proposed to be the source of the largest ballast oil spill in the history of the world. That mine has never been commercially opened.\n\nIn recent years, the deep methane emissions from the mining of coal tar has begun to affect the northern Rockies. But only a small portion of that emissions has reached the surface.\n\nThe area where the Don Creek landfill was situated is known as the Deep Green Shale. The coal tar is a carbon compound composed of carbon carbons and boron carbons. Both carbon and boron are increasingly used up in the production of carbonates that are highly valuable in oil and natural gas. They are also found in a major part of oil sands production, and other parts of the tar deposit. Carbonates, in general, have a very short shelf-life compared to traditional oil sands.\n\nBecause the Don Creek landfill is in a shale, the \"transmutation temperature\" of the coal tar is very high. That means that at any given time, radioactive and toxic chemicals emitted during extraction will eventually leach from the shales and into the aquifers that feed the aquifers in this area.\n\nSome of the pollutants migrating into aquifers within the Deep Green Shale include brine,\n\nsolvents (such as butane, propane, ether, and conventional butane)\n\na mixture of acids, acids-layers, and acids-lies\n\nferrofluids\n\nAerial view of Don Creek Waste Transfer Facility, Don Creek Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado., Track 777, 1967, courtesy Don Creek Ranch.\n\n\nPicture from Unknown Location. courtesy Don Creek Ranch.\n\nThe World's Largest Underground Rainforest Remains Protected from World Falsification\n\n\nDon Creek, situated to the north of Denver, Colorado, sits on a vast expanse of steaming, virgin coal tar sands that were developed during the nineteenth century, as coal tars at El Paso, Texas, began their upward trajectory into the currently tropical atmosphere.\n\nIn the late 1930s, coal tars were then being removed from all across the United States in which Denver remained the largest municipal coal mining centre. Most of the tars being cleaned and purified were sent for storage and cleaning in underground holds at the Don Creek Waste Transfer Facility in Estes Park, Colorado.\n\nSome sixteen acres of area now comprise the world's largest underground rainforest called the Western Slope of the Great Basin.\n\nFirst discovered by Dutch explorers Lewis and Clark on March 1, 1805, the western slope of the Great Basin consists of a combination of deltas and banks of ancient basalt. It extends to 2,134 m below sea level and has an altitude of 900 m above sea level. The western slope of the Great Basin has emerged from rainforests of the Alaska Range that made up a quilt of tundra that stretched from Canadian Rockies to Yosemite Valley, California.\n\nMost of this tundra and its ecosystem of primeval and formed living rock soil - also known as shale rock in the geologic sense - would have been toxic to previous human occupants of the Earth. It would have been a barren land full of organic matter and hard mineral structures. Water would have been an enormous problem and the fireballs that would have dispersed charred debris over distances as high as 700 km, along with heat and water, would have made life as we know it impossible.\n\nAnd yet the region remains untouched to this day, and has probably ever been again, for all the billions of years that humankind's existence on Earth has known.\n\nThere are very few commercial basins left available in such a level of planetary reach and scientific skill that they can be mined. There are probably thousands of permanently frozen beds of shale rock from the past, giving a superficial and illusory solidity. But, as civilizations develop beyond their ability to harness the power of lightning, cold and pollution, the basement rock under some of these basins undergoes protracted softening, like that of the ancient megacities we discover in most of our exploration - usually those located at the equator or near the poles.\n\nLand Whither Cultures of Mesoamerican Origins?\n\nLand of Dunes is a collection of modern satellites that was built by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and is a series of remote controlled traps that launch towards the stratosphere after", "human": "The Harsh Realities of Recycling in the Rockies\n\nLifting the lid on waste removal in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.\n\n\nThis article originally ran as \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\" in the Winter 2014 issue of Highline Magazine.\n\n\"What's in the bag?\" I whisper, watching the hairs on my buddy's neck stand on end. My accusatory heckle hisses through the shadowy night in a quiet residential neighbourhood in Jasper. I'm taking out the trash from a post-housewarming soiree. My friend, who didn't see me coming, is disposing of what looks to be his dog's fecal matter.\n\nMeeting someone at the garbage is always a social occasion.\n\nI'm slinking to the bins in the dead of night to dump a salmon carcass. I'm not sure if the remnants should go in compost or garbage, and frankly, I'll use the cloak of darkness to conceal my confusion. As for my buddy, he's just being a responsible dog walker.\n\nIs he going to compost that? I wonder.\n\nAfter seeing the unsorted mess that several inconsiderate \"recyclers\" have left in the cardboard, compost and garbage disposal containers lately, I have become wary of midnight dumpers. Over the last few weeks, with barely-repressed rage, I have discovered that, when it comes to properly sorting their refuse, some people in Jasper's newest housing development have not been pulling their weight. Smugly protective of my new neighbourhood's image (and known to rant when it comes to individual laziness that disrupts the collective harmony), tonight I am en guard. I am on self-appointed sanitary sentinel duty. I am a citizen on patrol.\n\nUntil it starts to feel weird.\n\nIt's easy for righteous writers, promise-prone politicians and naive neighbourhood watchers to make pronouncements appealing to our inner environmentalist, but managing our waste in Jasper, Banff and Canmore is like Oscar the Grouch's hoarding complex: it's complicated. Our increased awareness of the natural world is colliding with our ever-constant quandary of convenience over cost. And while there are lots of ways to tackle waste management, there is consensus that the consequences of managing it poorly will sell our future short, both environmentally and economically. In the Rockies, because of our communities' isolation, our close quarters with wildlife and the unique inputs and outputs of a high-volume tourism sector, the Three R's quickly turn into the Three C's: complexity, costliness and contradictions. Where to put the salmon bones is one thing; how to improve our waste diversion efforts is another kettle of fish altogether.\n\nBear proof = Blame proof\n\nAfter I realize it's my friend in the shadows and not a hungry grizzly bear, a machete-wielding serial killer, or a gaggle of wine-cooler-drinking 16-year-olds (my worst fears, not necessarily in that order), I remember it wasn't so long ago in Jasper that the fear of bumping into a four-legged dumpster diver was a legitimate concern. Before the community had locking, ursine proof bins installed, black bears and even the occasional grizzly roamed Jasper backyards in search of tasty rewards.\n\n\"There was a time when bears were as common as dogs,\" remembers 87-year-old Jasperite, Wanda Garford. \"You couldn't go down an alley without running into a bear.\"\n\nInevitably, human-wildlife conflicts were regular occurrences. As such, when locking-lidded infrastructure was installed in Canada's mountain parks in the 1980s, it was heralded as a great leap forward in managing how humans could live amongst wild animals.\n\nBut sealing the garbage off had another effect, although it would be years before it was identified as somewhat counter-intuitive to environmental best practices. In 2007, when the Municipality of Jasper conducted a waste audit, they learned that despite having implemented a residential recycling and compost program, the amount of materials which could have been diverted from the waste stream was more or less the same as when their recycling programs were nascent: somewhere around 30 per cent. And it hasn't improved much since. Those who were historically more inclined to sorting their waste \u2014 long-term residents who lived in single family dwellings \u2014 continued to do so, while those who were typically poor recyclers and composters \u2014 young people living in staff accommodations \u2014 remained negligent.\n\n\"[The diversion rate] has flat-lined.

{"eta": "Professor Quirrell threw away his wand as though it had caught fire, lurched away from Harry, and blurred down into his Animagus form.\n\nHarry pressed his wand to his lips, the terrifying implications of his encounter with a man's most feared and most deadly curse letting him know only that he should not say a word about what he had just heard, lest it be turned into a small tin can with liquid inside that \"would make a sickly Halloween corpse think it had eaten someone\". With a close sweep of Harry's wand, the curse burned down to nothing before vanishing completely. \"That didn't work, was it, boy?\"\n\n\"Yes, Headmaster,\" he replied weakly. \"However, even if it hadn't, we couldn't have destroyed the statue of Azkaban's supreme arch-enemy if it hadn't been for you.\" He paused, and stilled his voice. \"And I didn't think you were prepared to do that yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I am no professor of the subject, Harry,\" the dark-haired man admitted.\n\n\"Even if I am,\" Harry retorted curtly. His intent was clear: get to the bottom of why the Death Eaters kept being able to conjure the enemy and still outmaneuver Voldemort for thirty-six minutes, and destroy the evil plant all while meeting, at last, in mid-air, his greatest adversary.\n\n\"Then,\" the man pointed out, \"You must depart with the object of your revenge.\"\n\nThe instant the statement had left Harry's lips, he had been swept backwards by the force of the Spell-Hardening Potion. He broke the spell and fled down the winding staircase in the opposite direction, lost in a light display of Aurors. With the comfort of their presence, Harry found he could immediately detect the presence of a strong, demanding presence on his behalf, like a commander-in-chief ordering his subordinates to act quickly. He seized the opportunity to check the room again. Even in Death Eater-occupied lands, the Dark Lord's presence often lurked at the periphery.\n\nIt was in the minutes that followed that Harry began to grow worried for Malfoy. Harry knew he was in trouble \u2013 he had to know \u2013 but there was no one he could trust, he told himself as he felt his blood begin to boil. But then, Harry had seen Dumbledore's dark expression, the same greyish, without a trace of humor his friend seemed to be lost in. But how could Lucius Malfoy be in such danger? Surely he was far, far worse off than he was in Azkaban.\n\nHarry ran around the room, counting the dead and panicking as he did so. The other Aurors weren't idiots, he knew, and the wizards of Voldemort's previous puppet government often did no more than nod their heads in acknowledgment of a request to interrogate a fugitive. But, for as long as he could remember, Lucius Malfoy had always been the most criminal sort of Muggle.\n\nPotter, he thought, to all of the Muggles in the room, and especially to Lucius Malfoy. No, this is serious, you have to help me.\n\nWhat about Harry?\n\nThe Ravenclaw Professor wasn't speaking. She was disinterested, but as he descended the stairs to see his beloved friend, his mind swam with questions. What do you do when a body is found? Why is it that you hadn't been looking for him? And had you not meant to do that in the first place? To what end?\n\nTall and green, glaring at Harry from the darkened corridor of the condemned manor, Lucius Malfoy snarled, \"I wish it were you, Harry.\" Then he walked off into the shadows, leaving Harry and a third fellow Auror with the startled silence of their sudden discovery.\n\nThe rest of the building was surrounded by terrified Muggles, and both Malfoy and Dumbledore looked torn, as though they had just heard the secret talk of a dying wizard.\n\nA silent moment had passed. Then that silence was broken for all the world about by a loud gasp, which only confirmed that Malfoy was alive. It was a screeching voice that was recognized when the shock faded.\n\n\"Albus! Something's wrong!\" the frantic cry for help from the crying child demanded.\n\n\"What is it, Malfoy? What's happened?\" yelled the wand-carrying adult who had also been in the infirmary when those strange sounds had begun.\n\n\"That's Voldemort, boy. He's standing over you!\" the worried voice said. The sound of a wand and a knife flashed up and Harry and the other two ran into the room, yelling for the Aurors to show themselves.\n\n\"Yeah! Harry, can you run with me?\" yelled Malfoy, pointing to the ceiling. \"Don't do anything!\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Harry", "topp": "Professor Quirrell threw away his wand as though it had caught fire, lurched away from Harry, and blurred down into his Animagus form.\n\nHarry pressed his arm against the hand of his dying friend, and the world came alive around him. He bit down on his bottom lip and sighed.\n\nHe did not want to take this further.\n\nHarry knew the fight that Hagrid had aced him to win, but he could not assume that it meant the same as he knew it meant. He had won and now Sirius was completely unresponsive, but the man's body was still in a considerable condition. Without Hagrid's magic, and struggling to even open his eyes, Harry tumbled to the ground, his legs dragging over the floor like traces of pebbles in a shallow grave.\n\nHe lurched onto his hands and knees and sat up, scrabbling to find his glasses.\n\nSirius Belladonna lay on the ground. He had lost his glasses in his fight, and was blind in one eye from the process. He smelled, liked, and felt horrible. He breathed with difficulty. He repeated the motions of Falling Forward, before falling further, his hand curled into a fist, and burying his face in his hands.\n\nHarry pulled himself up and, screaming over a loud noise in the cave, flew out the cave exit to the streets of London. He scanned London, and although he was not able to see or speak, the streets looked familiar. The Ministry took him under their wing a long while ago, so now that he saw more of London, he could relate with him. He recognized it as a familiar street, a considerable distance away from the one he had fought in.\n\nHe paused at the Well of Records; he looked across to Diagon Alley, and the Fat Lady.\n\nHarry went over to the Met Police. There were left-handed wizards. Other disfigured wizards. He found Sirius, and introduced himself, checking to see his name was the same. Harry could not distinguish features; he had been accustom to that fact as the recipient of both Mr. Hagrid's wand and the Stone, a powerful wand possessing magic for visible forms. He had tried to never give his wand away without a slight risk of facing permanent destruction.\n\nSirius recognized Harry. Apparently, at least, he recognized him as 'Sirius Grey.' Sirius held up his wrist and Harry opened his Healing Potion-store. Harry frowned as the door dropped off it's hinges to a dull clang, reflecting old magic, in Professor Snape's hand, which was empty and trembling.\n\n\"I will give you the vial of elixir potion,\" Harry whispered.\n\nSirius nodded.\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"And I will bind my mouth shut.\"\n\n\"What do you want to do?\"\n\n\"Take two ingredients. Salt and orange juice.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" the voice said.\n\n\"Know whomever I bind shall not prove mentally unfriendly to anyone during their stay at all times. My wands shall be my power.\"\n\nSirius took a chubby envelope from his pocket, ripped off its heart-shaped envelope, and handed it to Harry. He set it in front of Harry. He looked closely at the formula printed inside; Dumbledore's Mind Perfecting Potion.\n\nAble to predict how Harry would react in this situation, Sirius explained that over half of what he had read about that potion worked on faster, faster wizards. Harry looked at him curiously.\n\n\"I can read minds?\"\n\n\"Not fully. I am almost, if not entirely, the same as Voldemort, with only one thing for the other half.\"\n\n\"But don't get me wrong, I just don't feel anything yet!\"\n\nSirius looked at Harry, smiling.\n\n\"What I do to ya make you pass out and wet yourself. Excessive euphoria makes you fall into one of these. But this will be the one that binds you to me.\"\n\nHarry grinned as he ruffled his feathers.\n\n\"What about all this bonding, then?\"\n\n\"Right now we do nothing but work together to subdue the enemies that threaten our very existence. And the great ally I have gained? We never work together, unless you want me to.\"\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\"I don't agree. With that man's actions\u2014\"\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" Sirius asked lightly.\n\n\"As you see fit. We have only got much to get on with. Keep him confined, unless you mind. He was bound to me before. Your thu\u2014\"\n\n\"Don't, no!\"\n\nSirius held a leg up to Harry to make his have the rest of the feathery appendage (which Draco had long gone this time) to either side of his torso, and Harry could not find it.", "human": "Professor Quirrell threw away his wand as though it had caught fire, lurched away from Harry, and blurred down into his Animagus form.\n\nHarry pressed his hands over his eyes, waiting for the pain to fade.\n\nWe did it. Professor Quirrell has the Stone.\n\nHarry exhaled slowly. Transfiguration was powerful enough already, and now they had the power to make it permanent.\n\nYou couldn't Transfigure specific people, of course, and nor could you Transfigure lost books, but bizarrely enough you didn't need perfect knowledge of what you were making to Transfigure it - Professor McGonagall didn't have an encyclopaedic knowledge of porcine biology, and Harry didn't know the precise specifics of a rocket. In fact, even steel was complicated: there were different sorts of steel with different amounts of carbon and other additives. Transfiguration could clearly get information from somewhere that wasn't the caster's brain.\n\nHarry opened his eyes and saw for the first time his surroundings.\n\nThe floor was worn and grey with dust, stained oddly brown in places. A slashed painting hung crookedly above a ruined fireplace, cold ashes spilling out over the floor. Nearby was a chair with three legs torn off. The room looked like it had been shredded. The whole place felt uneasy, like the quiet aftermath of a storm.\n\nHarry suppressed a shiver. Ahem, said Hufflepuff, it might actually be a good idea to be afraid of magical haunted houses.\n\nThe snake lay unconscious on the dusty floor, a sealed silver pouch behind it. Harry couldn't Innervate Professor Quirrell, and he wasn't sure that it was possible to shake a snake awake. Absently, Harry wondered how the rules for Animagus transformations worked - if you touched the Stone to an Animagus, were they trapped forever? What happened if you turned into an Animagus while holding an indestructible magical artefact, then died?\n\nIt was probably a good idea to start planning the best applications of the Stone, so Harry closed his eyes and thought.\n\nTransfiguration seemed even more strange the more that Harry considered it. The universe, or the Source of Magic, or whatever, would obligingly fill in all the necessary information about nerve configurations and biochemistry and such if you said give me a working pig from scratch, but not if you said give me a working Hermione Granger from scratch. It would give you all the information you needed, and which you absolutely didn't already know, to Transfigure a computer, but not to Transfigure a nanofactory. That didn't necessarily mean that nanofactories were impossible - Harry had tried to Transfigure a computer slightly more powerful than modern-day technology, and it hadn't worked either.\n\nHarry had been slightly disturbed by the idea that a fully living pig had popped into being, then vanished. He had wondered what would happen if you tried to Transfigure a generic human like McGonagall had Transfigured a generic pig, but had dismissed the experiment as hideously unethical.\n\nThat pig had known how to stand up, so its brain had worked perfectly well. Could it have just been some sort of Platonic ideal pig? Probably not, since it would be perfectly possible to Transfigure, say, a pig with five legs... Had Harry been too dismissive of the idea that souls existed? The existence of Voldemort's Horcruxes was at least weak evidence for them, and it would at least explain why you couldn't Transfigure specific people.\n\nYou couldn't Transfigure magical objects, but you could Transfigure something magical into something mundane, so the Stone should cure things like lycanthropy. If magic was based on a marker gene, that probably wouldn't make the wizard into a Muggle.\n\nThat was when Harry made the obvious connection.\n\nWizards were essentially Muggles with magic. They counted as magical creatures, but that was only a genetic thing. It would be entirely theoretically possible to use gene therapy to make a Muggle magical.\n\nYou couldn't Transfigure the mundane into the arcane. You could Transfigure all of a Muggle's genes into the exact same boring old chemical DNA, but with the genetic marker for magic - the Blood of Atlantis.\n\nThat would at a stroke extend people's lives massively, make them much, much safer... There were bound to be problems, but the number of lives saved would be enormous.\n\nThere was no reason the Universe couldn't contain \"I-win\" buttons like the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nHarry began to grin as the enormity of what had just happened hit him. He'd need to talk it over with Professor Quirrell, but things were looking good for world optimisation.\n\nHarry opened his eyes and looked up.\n\nHe was looking at the tip of an outstretched wand.\n\nThe wand fell away. \"Harry", "eta_suffix": " worried voice said.

{"eta": "In every respect but one, Iowa's Republican caucuses delivered a conventional result on Tuesday. In 2008, Iowan churchgoers laid hands on an affable rock guitarist, Mike Huckabee, who deftly learned to swim the national waters with his message of fear of immigrants, the \"Muslim Mafia,\" and a strong military. Mr. Huckabee, who finishes second in his native state, lives, as his campaign calls him, on \"Christianity.\" \"Nothing is more important to me then to see the marriage licenses in my state issued,\" he said at the time. \"Our country's charter is based on God and the Bible and the Constitution.\"\n\nIn 2012, the former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, a Republican, proved an expert in coming out on the wrong side of evangelicals. By his own estimation this year is going to be a closer call. \"He's going to want to be seen as a more serious candidate,\" said Matt Kibbe, a former Iowa GOP chairman. \"With him, they're looking for some soul.\"\n\nAlmost half of the voters in Iowa, and more than a third of Republican primary voters, said they are open to Mr. Rubio's candidacy, according to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg News poll released last week. Fifty-one percent of those voters, who don't belong to the traditional Tea Party movement, said that as a result.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Cruz\u2014or whoever it's they're supporting in New Hampshire next week\u2014spent much of last week calling out Mr. Rubio's all-too-familiar mistakes. \"Rubio is a frightened man who believes everything his mother tells him,\" said Ted Cruz, the Texas senator and son of Rafael Cruz, the senator and son of Rafael Cruz.\n\nIn Iowa, they are turning on Mr. Christie. Two weeks ago, their campaign said Mr. Christie was in big trouble with the conservative base, but this week his fortunes turned. All that polling says he is the favorite to win the endorsement of the state's organization of tea party activists who reject everything Mr. Rubio stands for.\n\nMr. Christie has not been on the national stage since the scandal that will haunt him for the rest of his candidacy: an admission in a 2005 book about his trip to the Dominican Republic that he had used state resources to pay for the sex-toy sales of teenagers in his wife's office. Mr. Christie has also defended himself in the wake of his remarks to a group of major Wall Street banks in 2012 in which he said Mr. Romney's Mormon faith and strong economic record was not a good \"cover story\" for his candidacy.\n\nMr. Perry's progress in Iowa has also been less dramatic. After announcing in late February last year that he was leaving to run for president, Mr. Perry touched a nerve. His stump speech made frequent reference to \"Satanists, sadists, murderers and monsters that are happy to engage in\u2014you want to call it a religious tradition\u2014Satan's fantasies, his lust, his abuse of the innocent.\"\n\nAnd there was the more serious question, pointed at Mr. Perry's long record of opposition to Obamacare. His Iowa campaign was billed as \"an evangelical counterweight\" to Mr. Christie, who told the Des Moines Register last week that he is \"not sympathetic\" to the tea party's problems and that Mr. Perry was the former governor \"I like best.\" Mr. Perry, a Presbyterian, said a trip home to South Carolina for the evangelicals there earlier this month didn't alter how he would vote.\n\nOn the Republican side, Mr. Rubio has made it clear that he is a different sort of candidate than the rest of the field. Asked by an Iowa voter Sunday about the effectiveness of his Spanish-language speeches, Mr. Rubio told a group at Iowa State University: \"They are effective when they are well-received and when they are well-disguised.\"\n\nMr. Rubio is here today, anyway, as a kind of last-chance stop for Iowa voters to see if they prefer his brand of conservatism to Mr. Christie or to another prospective 2016 candidate. Mr. Rubio has embraced the spotlight that came with his days at the governor's mansion and has even thrown in a bit of dynamism at a moment when his GOP rivals are being hit hard and perhaps most dearly by the grilling over past statements. \"They made me in the past look ridiculous,\" he has said in response to one recent attempt to pressure a controversial video of him commenting inappropriately on a female reporter.\n\nAt this stage, Iowa voters are searching for something familiar about Mr. Rubio's campaign. \"I can tell, in his stump speech, that he is not one to make comments about other people's wives,\" said lawyer Dora McCullough, 53, a Republican from Gilbert. \"He is not one to be picking on people.\"\n\nWhat they want, for now, is a candidate who can resonate on a state with a traditionally more liberal approach. Mr. Perry", "topp": "In every respect but one, Iowa's Republican caucuses delivered a conventional result on Tuesday. In 2008, Iowan churchgoers laid hands on an affable rock guitarist, Mike Huckabee, a former governor, an ecclesiastical leader, and a likely Democratic nominee. Bush secured the nomination with 58 percent of the vote, according to the final results. So he cannot be blamed for hoping that the outcome of the caucuses would prove the scenario that he feared just seven years ago\u2014of having the Republicans nominate Paul Ryan, who, if elected president, would leave the House in 2013, a mere year after the last caucuses in Iowa. Such polling has apparently been rigged to ensure the Republicans' eventual nominee being a noted Republican icon like Romney or Gingrich.\n\nIn Iowa in 2008, by contrast, a favorite son\u2014a religionman with no political experience but who was charismatic and enticing to pastors of all political persuasions\u2014striked an ominous tone about Washington, meek former governors, conservative religious leaders, and modernized government. Bush must know.\n\nIllustrating his electability, he suddenly caught fire in caucus goers' minds. In February 2007, Huckabee declared that \"elites like the tax code and the government control our economy\"\u2014public figures who flatter heaping satisfaction on nations and making profit possible, or just reminders about current problems\u2014are \"unborn\" enemies of \"the principles of America.\" Jeb Bush, soon thereafter, stepped out of the brief and isolated isolation of that year to endorse the current ruling elite and her beliefs. Bush's trouble is that a candidate that foolishly picks up on his weirdness is no longer electable. In the 2008 caucus, as in 2008, it mattered not a whit what a candidate thought or said about God and Mormonism.\n\nThe day Bush made his visit, even the crowd was anxious; some prayed as he walked through a gas station parking lot. One woman yelled that \"He had a really good speech.\"\n\nWithin the next month, Bush conceded defeat and announced that he had returned to private life. Perhaps those invisible vast swaths of voters were drawn to a musing about the \"law of gravity\" and cold hard realities. But the idea of a tubthumping combination of candidates being best suited to society seemed a dream. The Republican Party has become a radically different party in 2008 than the one a half century earlier, when expanding jobs and incomes were considered victories against jobs and incomes that were never there. Here was evidence of where the party was headed.\n\nA candidate that fails to demonstrate that now falls prey to the more invasive and dangerous strategy of psychology that seeks to turn conservatives against any possibility of another Bush. Here is where Republicans need to reconnect with the unifying \u2014 and vital \u2014 aspect of the conservative movement that was wrong in 2008: beliefs in limited government, a post-Reagan conservative coalition, and a certain amount of personal responsibility. As Ross Perot told voters in the 2008 presidential primary: Republicans need to send their presidential nominee \"on a fast-pace pickup truck toward the conservative spirit\" because \"I am so far from either party.\" That's where Romney also lies.\n\nAll that has left Republicans in denial. The \"can-do\" cool that prevailed the last few years was baked into the base in the 2004-08 election cycle. Democrats, who maneuvered to keep Bush out of the first round of debates and unchallenged, were able to outmaneuver the conservative movement by advertising ill-will toward itself in the form of the humble commentariat, an unconvincing bit of a bullhorn of its own. If the GOP was captivated by a candidate with impossible skin, a spoof by Rachel Maddow, a restless group of consultants and social conservatives, a steady flow of consultants, and the fear of a young woman's voice too malleable to last, what did that suggest?\n\nThe Republican candidates have applied\n\nthe same type of \"can-do\" franchise to the Democrats; after settling on a theology of \"anticipatory control,\" a dose of hauling, and a dose of platitudes, they have then begun to press-publish soundbites. The tone that one hears in Obama's stump speech, and that of the candidates' rhetoric, is now partisan, self-serving, so familiar that the whole party aspires to imitate it. That corporate-friendly message is packaged by Michael Gerson, the conservative spokesman for George W. Bush, as \"a repulsive outgrowth of a genteel faith.\" \"There's a decent argument for making President Obama a different sort of candidate,\" he said, \"one that holds people accountable, instead of pandering to them.\"\n\nPolitically, Republican leaders' response was parochial. Jeb Bush blamed an attack during the 2012 primary on Soros, too. The old adage that if a joke gets you laughs, so much the better, is still true, as every stump speech and interview, from this point forward, shows. But as Karl", "human": "In every respect but one, Iowa's Republican caucuses delivered a conventional result on Tuesday. In 2008, Iowan churchgoers laid hands on an affable rock guitarist, Mike Huckabee. This time, they have lifted up the much less likable Rick Santorum. In any event, the corporate-funded wing of the Party will now muster its financing, polling, and ad-making machine to assure the nomination of its candidate, Mitt Romney. It would be very surprising if it failed.\n\nThe unconventional aspect was the vote for Ron Paul. After raising expectations high, Paul finished a close-run third in Iowa, so his media momentum may slip. And yet never before has a candidate running on such a radical, and specifically libertarian platform\u2014abolish the Federal Reserve, withdraw from all foreign entanglements, end the war on drugs\u2014done so well. The size and character of his vote suggest his candidacy will matter right until November. His supporters included many young people, out-of-state volunteers, and cyber-activists. They are not going to melt away. Yet they are not going to secure the Republican nomination for their man, either. What, then?\n\nThis looks like an election cycle ripe for small-party or third-party candidates. The bases of both main parties include unusually large numbers of disillusioned voters. Movements like the Tea Party and the Occupy groups have already constructed networks that small-party candidates could adapt and synthesize with sections of Ron Paul's base.\n\nIn this post-Citizens United era, in which corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals are free to spend unlimited amounts of money to support their mainstream candidates, it would be hard for such candidates to do anywhere near as well nationally in November as Paul did on Tuesday in Iowa. But they could nonetheless tip the election, most likely in favor of President Obama, by drawing off votes in swing states that might otherwise go to Romney.\n\nObama versus Romney looks, from this admittedly great and unpredictable distance, like it will be a close-run thing. Ralph Nader's vote in Florida in 2000, which arguably cost Al Gore the Presidency, is a reminder that even relatively small numbers of disenfranchised-feeling but mobilized voters can decide close Presidential races\u2014and it's not the only one.\n\nIn 2008, Obama's margin of victory over John McCain in North Carolina was 14,177 votes. The Libertarian Party won 25,722 votes in North Carolina that year. In Colorado, where small-party candidates can access the ballot relatively easily, the Libertarians, the Constitution Party, the Greens, and others took just under two per cent of the vote altogether. In Florida, Obama's margin over McCain in 2008 was 236,450 votes\u2014and that was in an election with maximally favorable conditions for Obama. The total small-party vote\u2014pre-Occupy, pre-Tea Party\u2014was 63,046.\n\nThere are two nominating conventions scheduled before the end of June that will help determine how Ron Paul's followers, as well as other disenchanted voters, might make themselves felt in November. The first is the Libertarian Party's convention, to be held in Las Vegas in May. Paul ran for President as a Libertarian in 1988, in between his stints as a Republican member of Congress. He told CNN recently, \"I have no intention of doing that. No plans, and no desire. Flat out, I don't want to.\" That sounds pretty clear, but he will come under pressure to reconsider, especially if the Republican establishment angers him or his followers by, say, refusing to provide him with a prime-time speaking slot at the Party's convention, in Tampa.\n\nIf Paul did run again as a Libertarian, he would surely exceed the Party's best-ever performance in a Presidential election of about a million votes nationally, in 1980, another year of discontent. (The candidate was Ed Clark.) Carla Howell, the Party's executive director, told me this week that Libertarian Party will qualify for the general-election ballot in virtually all states\u2014\"the high forties, if not fifty\"\u2014and there is good reason to think it could.\n\nEven if Paul demurs, the Party is likely to nominate in Vegas a more appealing candidate, and to muster a more effective organizing effort online and in the field, than it did in 2008, when the Libertarians brought forward, on the convention's sixth ballot, Bob Barr, the right-wing former Republican congressman from Georgia, whose distinctions include wearing what may be the least attractive mustache in American politics. Gary Johnson, a two-term Republican governor of New Mexico (another prospective battleground state in an Obama-Romney contest), has already declared he will compete for the Libertarian nomination in 2012.

The situation is as follows:\n\nAverage rent: $150 a mth (9.5% of retail sales)\n\n10% of retail sales: $150 per month (9.25% of retail sales)\n\n14.5% of retail sales: $180 per month (9.75% of retail sales)\n\n35% of retail sales: $240 per month (9.75% of retail sales)\n\n75% of retail sales: $300 per month (10% of retail sales)\n\n100% of retail sales: $350 per month (10.25% of retail sales)\n\nThere are reports of extra-long leases where merchants can pay for rent up to 10 times longer than the advertised rent.\n\nThis report details the increasing difficulties which experienced businesses will face in filling on-demand purchases with the regular supply of luxury goods. The prices on the store fronts are now super-high for the electronics, clothes, jewellery and furniture stores.\n\nHong Kong luxury goods and status symbols are highly coveted right now. People will leave a store with high demand for luxury goods with a low price tag and will demand more. This has contributed to a three-fold increase in store rent by about 2% by April.\n\nThe authorities are attempting to reduce the rents in the price-sensitive items (gifts, watches etc.) but this only helps to slow the supply to meet the high demand. The mainland still owns more than 100% of Hong Kong's jewelry market.\n\nThe resulting power play means that anyone wishing to run a retailer in any of these expensive items must struggle against the conflicting interests of high end traders, retailers who want to convert the surplus into higher profits and the mainland whose profit margins are often hit by the 'globalization' of shopping.\n\nIf we think about the situation in the US retail industry, this is not a new problem. Only recently did we see a huge increase in supply of discount chains for hardware and also electronics but still today the actual volume of retail is still being over supplied. The current reality might be a longer term shift towards more consolidation and selling under the roof of the chip assembly facilities.\n\nNow those of you worried about the effect of this change must be worried, as the government of China is trying to jumpstart the retail market. One of the officials the government has promised to work with is Huang Zhongzen, China's President of Industry and Commerce; the last time these two met was six months ago when Huang was given a gold medal to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic; this meeting was also aimed at possibly recruiting more big-name retailers to the Chinese market.\n\nThe current trend of consolidating retailers, who in the past would have been fighting with a wide assortment of small sellers and sellers, is giving way to smaller, more focused and competitive stores. This is how we see these practices in action. For example, I can still remember the awkward stage at the annual Soho Leather fair in 1997 when an owner of a \"restaurant\" closed abruptly and left the whole shopping floor of Soho was once again filled with competing providers of retail goods.\n\nChina's health minister will be visiting the US later this year to bring some good news on the market: he plans to release a study about the effect of mall development on China's retail sector.\n\nSource: Business Insider.com\n\nThe direct involvement of the Chinese government in Hong Kong was not the only issue which was met with outcry by the industry \u2013 the acceptance of a number of monopolies were mentioned throughout the article. If new regulations (of a kind that are discussed from time to time here) are imposed on luxury goods, everyone will begin to fear an all-out struggle for market share. The commission report refers to such a potential situation as: \"a power struggle in Hong Kong's luxury retail sector\".\n\nConsidering the commercial decision made by the current Government of China to maintain their \"Pro-Market\" stance on nearly all issues has also failed to quell the existing unrest in Hong Kong. And this attitude is becoming stronger; the 2013 elections have seen a strong shift in direction.\n\nSource: hongkongstandard.com\n\nA late night purge from the ranks of Hong Kong's luxury industry was announced by the current HK Chief Secretary CY Leung where nearly 4 of their number are out; almost 6 would have been in.

As the Standard reports:\n\nBusiness is getting tougher for Hong Kong's retailers with the value of total retail sales dipping 1.6 percent in the first half of 2015 from a year back, according to the Census and Statistics Department's latest data. Valuable gifts, including jewelry, watches and luxury goods, were hardest hit, with sales falling for 10 consecutive months. Sales value slumped 10.4 percent in June compared with a year earlier, despite efforts by several luxury brands \u2013 including Italian fashion house Prada \u2013 to boost sales by cutting prices. Squeezed by slimmer pickings in Hong Kong and the mainland market, top global luxury brands are looking to renegotiate store rents to cut costs. The latest to plead for landlords' mercy was French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. Revenue from its signature brand Louis Vuitton slumped 10 percent year- on-year in Hong Kong, Macau and China for the first half while Europe and the United States saw stronger sales of fashion and leather goods. It is also planning to close a directly operated shop of its biggest watch brand, Tag Heuer, in Causeway Bay. [\u2026] British high-end fashion house Burberry, which has 16 shops in the SAR, said it may trim its local store network and negotiate for lower rents after the Hong Kong market, which accounts for about one-tenth of the brand's total sales, saw a double-digit percentage fall in sales over the period. Meanwhile, Gucci owner Kering said it will consider closing its Hong Kong and Macau outlets if rents stay high. [\u2026] Waning sales and whopping rents have sent Italian fashion label Baldinini packing. It shut its first and only flagship boutique in Hong Kong after just four months in operation, ending its three- year contract. In June, visitor arrivals from the mainland were down 1.8 percent year- on-year. Adding to the woes of luxury goods vendors are the changing spending patterns of mainland visitors, who are now looking for more mid-priced products.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nWe don't believe this is happening because prospective clients can no longer afford these goods. While Chinese consumers of ostentatious luxury items have probably taken a hit from China's economic weakness and its wobbling real estate and stock market bubbles, they can surely still afford to buy Gucci bags and Tag Heuer watches. We believe that they rather no longer want to be seen adorned with such items.\n\nThe Dow Jones Luxury Index has actually peaked in May 2014 already \u2013 click to enlarge.\n\nTypically a decline in the desire to own products conferring and announcing one's high social status happens close to, or hand in hand with fairly severe economic downturns. People no longer want to stand out as rich when times are getting tough. This effect can be observed in numerous areas, even in the colors and shapes people choose when buying cars. The colors tend to change from loud ones such as red, to inconspicuous/conservative ones such as gray and brown. Car shapes tend to go from sportive and sleek to boxy and inconspicuous.\n\nOf course there is an additional reason for this development in China as our friend reminded us:\n\n\"Your point they no longer want to be seen with them is especially acute today with mainland Chinese, who are (were) the big buyers of luxury goods, property and services here. [\u2026] The mainland's corruption clampdown is deterring a lot of PRC citizens from exhibiting any wealth these days, a continuing crackdown that has lasted far longer than any Hong Kong businesses suspected and which has changed the dynamics of mainlander's inward and outward spending.\"\n\nTo this we would point out that China's relentless crackdown on corruption is informed by the same \"social mood\" that is driving the reluctance to buy luxury items, and is driving capital outflows from China as well as the increasing unwillingness of businesses to invest. These developments are simply manifestations of an environment that has soured: They signal that China's entire society is increasingly infested with a bearish outlook.\n\nRecently China's government has managed to halt the decline in the Shanghai stock market at what has reportedly been a huge cost. Zerohedge has published an article on a Goldman Sachs estimate of the amounts of money thrown at the market through government intervention.

Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nThe newest restrictions were made behind closed doors Thursday during a meeting at the State Corrections Department. They are aimed at shortening the state's stay-behind-the-grid jail population, which some have called a prison contagion that's damaging the state's image and endangering inmates and corrections officers.\n\nGov. Dennis Daugaard, a Democrat, vowed at Friday's hearing to examine whether C-Dorm will stay open permanently next year, although he did not give any timeline. But his deputy, Joseph Davidge, said the changes have provided a \"second chance to the women.\"\n\nThe questions arose in 2013 after a female inmate, Sara Way, starved to death at Gadsden's halfway house, leaving behind a 1-year-old child. C-dorm is in the corner of the prison complex, closest to the beach. It's filled with matrons and other inmates from the Women on Wheels program, and the limited length of stay, people who study the state's corrections system say, signals the low quality of its inmates.\n\n\"A safe lockup would not be reached without residents who are dependable, respectful, and not repeat offenders,\" said Justin Barnard, a member of the Massachusetts Commission on Jail Standards who gave a presentation at Thursday's hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the new terms, Gadsden will charge residents a $89 a month fee for stays of less than 24 hours. Beyond that, the state would pay for clean and safe living quarters, including a 9-foot-by-5-foot dormitory and a 25-square-foot floor-to-ceiling microwave where women can read books or use a digital camera.\n\nWomen can stay in a C-dorm bed, the cost of which will be directly correlated to the woman's income, with 2.3 square feet spread for each person. The payment will be \"flat-rate,\" meaning it covers both the cost and the fixed electricity and water costs for electricity.\n\nDozens of women, many of them with young children, jammed into a single room in Gadsden's C-dorm last fall after the South Carolina Department of Public Safety swept into the facility. Some placed unwanted toys in the hallway. Prison officials eventually removed the security personnel and incarcerated several women there for roughly six weeks.\n\nWearing sweats and flip-flops, other women made phone calls or watched DVDs from a phone with a mirrored surface, to prevent ghosts from haunting their beds.\n\n\"When they read the notices, they are amazed that the government should do that,\" said Jamie Brodsky, who recently returned to Gadsden after a year at Cape Breton Regional Correctional Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who are new to prison, they will be eligible for Gadsden's property-management program, which costs up to $900 a month and includes cleaning services, meals, and even haircuts. A prison spokesman said the residents will be switched to HSHBs, though he didn't have details.\n\nSome who worked for years in the local corrections department told lawmakers that they don't want to leave \u2014 even if they don't fit the current population. They say Gadsden is an affordable option for women who are hurting financially because of bad divorces or difficult pasts, and are looking to move past their troubled pasts.\n\nThey also want to keep C-dorm as their base of operations if they're given the option next year.\n\nWith the loosening of occupancy, advocates hope Gadsden will attract people from the Boston area for jobs, get more kids involved in school, and, more broadly, make the community hospitable and more interesting, Gadsden's own corrections director said.\n\nPamela Downing contributed to this report.", "topp": "By Mary Ellen Klas\n\nMiami Herald\n\nQUINCY, Fla. \u2014 The 284 women housed in C-dorm at Gadsden Correctional Institution lived for years in squalid conditions, including a hallway where inmates fell prey to rats, dormitories where prisoners could be violently beaten by their own, and daily meal and shower drags where nude prisoners were whipped, stabbed or flogged with a towel.\n\nBut all those times when rape and other assaults were nearly routine forced inmates to draw strength, integrity and tolerance from an unlikely friend \u2014 Pinellas County Judge Alan Johnson, who in 1984 determined that C-dorm had a moral obligation to provide more dignity, basic care and cleanliness to potential victims of abuse.\n\nPinellas County Executive Warren Evans unveiled the county's $16.4 million to relocate the inmates to four jails in 2009 and, soon, take new precautions to reduce violence, such as enlisting the assistance of private training groups at C-dorm to teach inmates skills such as care of hungry, sick or injured inmates.\n\nJohnson said in December that C-dorm's relatively benign reputation made its psychological impact on inmates and their jailers \"disturbing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a decade-long program to teach self-defense and use-of-force training is now focused on safety, Johnson said in October at an update of a 2006 program, dubbed the batterer-recovery program. It requires all staff to carry training on appropriate use of deadly force by licensed community practitioners.\n\nOfficials with North Miami Correctional Facility and the Florida Department of Corrections said female inmates elected not to wear their prison uniforms this month because of the rape-inflicted conditions.\n\n\"These are first-time offenders,\" said Dyall Johnson, a representative for Gadsden Correctional Institution who oversees inmate welfare and training. \"We need to hold them accountable for the conditions that put them in these situations. Those are the best choices if we have victims.\"\n\nThe reforms were one of six parts of a package of jail improvements likely to be unveiled Monday by Gadsden Correctional Attorney Sidney Jay.\n\nHe said prison officials wanted to set a precedent for the improvement of services and measures as part of a broader effort to combat what he sees as a growing threat of sexual assault and violence in the county's overcrowded jails. He said that essentially was the plan, until court-ordered reforms ceased the removal of women inmates last year.\n\n\"I don't expect the existing jail policies to change,\" Jay said. \"It's unfortunate that they've had to do it.\"\n\nBut Johnson, who also is C-dorm's operations manager, said inmates on his weekly suicide watch detail don't usually have the voices and qualities inmates now believe were used against them.\n\n\"It's just too small and too isolated to be a threat,\" he said.\n\nJoseph Cox\n\nFor example, a recent program as part of a three-part innovative plan focused on programming for prisoners suffering from mental illness, included segregated groups from elementary school through high school that included inmates making a complete mental correction to previous feelings of isolation and loneliness.\n\nOne group, led by inmate Thomas Morris, was made up of teenagers from high school, some wearing T-shirts with the words \"Let's Be Real\" written in Italian, an initialism that most inmates agree translates to \"Let's be real.\"\n\n\"I never had such a choir before,\" said Morris, who hails from Miami-Dade's south central district.\n\nFew advocates shared those sentiments with me. Among others interviewed for this article, several said their suspicions were overblown.\n\n\"I never had to sit quietly and listen to them whispering thoughts. I once sat for hours and listened to them tell me stories,\" said Tamara Olson, 79, a registered nurse who is serving a 70-year prison sentence for burglary.\n\nIn her case, Allen Mack, a 32-year-old web developer, had fantasized about sex with teenagers and had long wanted to treat rape as anything more than a physical offense, avoiding the militarized thinking that many male inmates receive.\n\nMack's realization that he would not get out of jail, with his crime expunged, prompted him to secretly record videos that ultimately resulted in his conviction and he is appealing his conviction. The potential victims were protective of each other in the video.\n\nOlson said she recalls inmates swearing. And in the minutes before a stepwise series of raping, which she described with disgust, she heard Morris curse, yell \"Save me\" and scream in pain. The only person who remained calm, she said, was Johnson.\n\n\"I definitely respect him because he saw me being abused and he did what he could,\" Olson said, adding the male inmates made no attempts to change proceedings.\n\n\"The things that are being experienced are different,\" Olson said. \"Some people really didn't appreciate (being attacked", "human": "By Mary Ellen Klas\n\nMiami Herald\n\nQUINCY, Fla. \u2014 The 284 women housed in C-dorm at Gadsden Correctional Institution lived for months without hot water or heat, faced flooded bathrooms daily and endured water rations when the septic tanks were jammed with food waste.\n\nAfter state Rep. David Richardson demanded action following a series of surprise visits over the past 18 months, the private prison operator that runs the facility \u2014 Management Training Corp. of Centerville, Utah \u2014 received approval from the state to repair and replace the water heater, at a cost to taxpayers of nearly $10,000. But Warden Shelly Sonberg never authorized the work.\n\nGadsden Correctional Institution (Photo/Gadsden Correctional)\n\nRichardson, a Miami Beach Democrat, announced another inspection this month, this time with Chad Poppell, the head of the Department of Management Services, the state agency that oversees private prisons, and two other state legislators.\n\nIn the two days before they arrived, four work crews descended on the prison and made many of the repairs. The vice president of the private prison operator, Management Training Corp., also arrived in town to meet with state officials. The state's chief inspector general, Melinda Miguel, dispatched inspectors to assess the safety and welfare of the inmates.\n\nFor Richardson, who has been on a one-man mission to force change in Florida's troubled prison system, it's another frustrating example of the failure of the state to monitor and hold accountable its prison operators.\n\n\"I'm a policymaker. I'm not a monitor. I'm not their auditor. Why is it that I'm out there fixing water heaters?\" he said.\n\nIn a letter to Richardson Thursday, Poppell said he has since removed the state-paid official in charge of monitoring conditions at the prison and has also launched his own investigation.\n\nHe said the 22-year-old prison, like other private prisons built by the state, are \"now beginning to show their age and present problems associated with older buildings.\" He said he has asked the Legislature to fund a full-time staff person to monitor \"evolving infrastructure issues.\"\n\nA note from an inmate at Gadsden Correctional to Rep.

They learned that there are 495 open work orders for repairs. Inmates said they had been pressured not to speak to inspectors and feared retaliation.\n\nRichardson, a retired forensic auditor, has had success in calling attention to the problems he has uncovered at state-run prisons. He has revealed evidence of officer-on-inmate violence at youthful offender facilities, uncovered how gangs evaded officers, caught officers withholding food from inmates, and persuaded the Department of Corrections to close down Lancaster Correctional Institution, a youthful offender prison. He uncovered \"horrific\" conditions at Columbia Correctional, where toilets wouldn't flush, showers didn't work, a heating system didn't heat and deafening sounds came from an exhaust fan.\n\nHe also dug deep into the finances at Lake City Correctional Institution, another one of the state's seven privately operated prisons and discovered Corrections Corporations of America, now known as CoreCivic of Tennessee, had overcharged the state at least $16 million over the past seven years.\n\nMost of his reports have been welcomed by Corrections Secretary Julie Jones but resulted in silence from Republican lawmakers and Gov. Rick Scott, who last year recommended directing more money into improving the facilities at the state-run system for the first time, after years of shifting more state-run prison programs to private operators.\n\nRichardson made his first unannounced trip to Gadsden Correctional on Oct. 7, 2015, he said. Then, he found no teachers in many of the classrooms \u2014 and made a mental note to return.\n\nOn his next visit, on March 6, 2016, he spent nearly two hours with inmates in the recreation yard and heard then about the problems with the hot water.

{"eta": "Italian Marxist Raniero Panzieri on the capitalist use of technology and machines.\n\nIntroduction to Panzieri\n\nIt is well known that, for Marx, the machines used by capitalist industry are just as much instruments of the bourgeoisie as land, and thus, according to him, are worthy of being taken up and used by the bourgeoisie itself to achieve the socialist revolution. The precise manner in which Marx developed his own use of technologies is debated.\n\nPanzieri's text is extremely important for its insights into the relationship between technology and the market as a whole. He provides very advanced considerations on the political and ideological implications of what he calls the modern atomist process of capitalist technological development, and he extends his original argument into the present day political sphere, as well as into many other fields such as the administration of the state. This important text is primarily a discussion on the question of how technology influences society in general. Panzieri begins the discussion by introducing himself and his ideas with an explanation of his own peculiar intellectual position: his involvement with revolutionary Marxists, his background in philosophy, his sense of'specialness', and, perhaps most of all, his attraction to the philosophers of antiquity, including Plato and Aristotle. He then gives a history of the modern atomism and its relation to capitalism and the other major social and political systems under the Roman Empire (Italy in particular), and moves to the formulation of a theoretical position which he describes as \"To Disregard the Modern Atomism\". Later, he sets forth a practical program which he envisages that capitalism would follow shortly after the French Revolution, in that then the feudal remnants would be decisively thrown out as a source of support for capitalist development, while then a secularised society would take over as the embodiment of the Protestant Enlightenment. Panzieri begins the use of technology in this way:\n\nThe modern atom has two forms: either it is revolutionary, like democracy, or it is conservative, like the feudal system, or it is hybrid, like the capitalist system. The first of these is the revolution, the second of these is the counter-revolution, and that is why we should particularly remember to take the modern atom as the constructive counter-revolution: either it is successful, or it is not. The modern atom is either revolutionary or it is not; it does not dare to be either; it is the big revolution or the little revolution, because one of them must die.\n\nIn his formulation of this conception, Panzieri begins by pointing out that, historically, there has been a class struggle between two sets of technological developments and the traditional elite class in the service of one set of advances (the feudal system). He also warns against'religious concepts' in attempting a prescription of how history can go from one set to the other:\n\nThe so-called modern concepts of progress which at present we find so common and so easy to understand cannot be adduced from the here and now because each one is but the product of the experience of an individual of the privileged class; but this, at least, is no reason to reject them. For if we not only tolerate the commoner ideas of progress but really seek to integrate them we shall find that in fact, although they are in one way or another connected in the end with one another, or are fully compatible with one another, yet they do not in themselves indicate any particular path to the future; some are dominant at one time, others in another, and they necessarily have something to do with some others. In other words, we are not provided with such perfect ideas of the future when, and if, these progressions continue in a hierarchical fashion, and when this is no longer the case all the sudden it ceases to be a problem of the future but a question of the past. There is then no reason to mourn because they have died in one way or another.\n\nAfter this section is completed, Panzieri maintains that, even if it is possible, a limited type of evolution will still be necessary for the creation of a stable and harmonious society. The final section deals with the problem of how technology, the medium through which society is to be represented and reproduced, will be allocated during the transitional period after the revolution, and briefly, post-empire period. In his discussion on this, Panzieri begins by discussing the problems involved in a time of transition:\n\nThe capitalist system is already opposed by the evolution already found in itself; the Western form of human society presents all sorts of limits, not to say contradictions. Its origin is a by-product of the history, is perhaps even its most obvious obstacle; and if there is any social machine to be put into motion, it has to be one in which the formerly almost indeterminate development would no longer be the decisive factor. Hence the complete constancy and complexity of capitalist technology and the quickness of the disposes of men, to say the least. The programmatic course of such a process is clear.\n\nThe political implications", "topp": "Italian Marxist Raniero Panzieri on the capitalist use of technology and machines.\n\nIntroduction to Panzieri\n\nIt is well known that, for Marx, the capitalist mode of production is an economic system in general, an elementary form, as opposed to the complex economic sphere of the economy as a whole, and a further development into the complex division of labour under capitalism is only to be discovered in so far as this complex division of labour has metamorphosed into \"extension of production\" and taken over the application of the same principles of technical work, the formulation, as we shall see. It is in this wide field of operations, under the supervision of co-operation between the worker and machine, that the little stage of the capitalist mode of production (insofar as it is an economic system) ends and the all-encompassing (and especially the free) mode of production begins. Marx's remark will be applicable, also, to the fact that industry extended itself into all spheres of production under the signal of capitalism and that it is this industrial aspect of the present-day capitalist mode of production which the modern proletarian can thus understand to be \"the workplace\" in which the \"being with the fingers\" turns out to be the most characteristic and peculiar element of the capitalist economic system. In addition to the major theoretical analysis of modern industry, Marx developed a rich theoretical outlook on and references to the history of economic crises which can be useful in describing the phenomena of capitalist production, especially those that he discusses in relation to the relation between capitalism and feudalism.\n\nThis study has to do with Panzieri's note on co-operation in a system of industrial culture. Panzieri's contributions in this field were among his most important contributions to Marxist economic theory and during his time was the main intellectual influence on him and the natural agent through which he extended the philosophical work of Capital.\n\nPanzieri in his short book, Political Economy, gives his treatment of this with admirable brevity; in this volume he treats the matter of co-operation in a capitalist economy, detailing the economic basis of this co-operation, and enumerates the beginnings, the ideal conditions of development, and the actual functions of the various states of the economy.\n\nPanzieri first gives his account of co-operation in fact, seeing in this the first requisite for the connection of work, the communication of the group to the skill or power of another. It is both simple and obvious that for a worker to see the work performed by another person, one must be able to see them and know them to a certain extent, namely, not only their names, not only their place of origin, but their family connection as well.\n\nWhat is it then about the capitalist that makes his workers co-operate?\n\nThe importance of this other person has been chiefly evidenced in mathematical natural sciences, where the possibilities of even isolated individuals for analysis of the effects and development of a scientific theory are maintained by the participation of the cooperators in the general development of the world of concrete work and by the special knowledge about their own workplace. This is the basis of the co-operation between the worker and the worker's tool.\n\nIf co-operation were the result of the absence of competition and when production and consumption were defined as exclusively co-operatives, this would be enough to make the co-operation of the worker and the worker's tool possible. But. Panzieri's meaning is actually different, it is precisely those conditions which make co-operation possible which does not occur without co-operation.\n\nWe all know the connection between moral and physical feelings. If one believes in God, what one wants depends on that one, for both the moral and the physical side are linked. This is also the case for the worker. He who does not satisfy himself mentally. or physically or mentally requires external stimulus. This is not to say that the worker does not want any stimulus, it's just that he knows what is necessary for him to produce and for his co-operative work to make endurable.\n\nPanzieri explains in detail the general process, that is to say, of production of the various goods and institutions which are necessary for co-operative work. But he chooses not to separate this analysis into the necessary process of production and the moral-physical side.\n\nPanzieri then deals with the first stage of production, the material process, more particularly his treatment of machines and machinery as the tools of the co-operative labour and why they are given the broadest use.\n\nPanzieri's belief in their eventual specialisation is also a fundamental part of his theory. How the whole of production forms the generic form is a matter which does not concern us here, nor does it concern Panzieri. These are merely practical questions. But we have already had a glimpse of it here, for we have also seen that, according to his theory, capitalism will, from this point of view, develop itself into", "human": "Italian Marxist Raniero Panzieri on the capitalist use of technology and machines.\n\nIntroduction to Panzieri\n\nIt is well known that, for Marx, capitalism revolutionizes both \"the groupings into which society is divided\" and \"the technical processes of labour\". What is less well known is that Marx theorizes the unity of these two moments (social groupings and technical processes) as constituting \"a specifically capitalist mode of production\" (our emphasis). Taken in isolation from the technical processes of labour the social groupings (i.e. wage-labourers and capitalists) constitute what Marx calls a formal subsumption of labour under capital; but on the basis of this formal subsumption there is erected a set of \"methods,means and conditions\" of production which Marx terms the real subsumption of labour under capital. This is elaborated at length in Marx's recently published Results of the Immediate Process of Production (the so-called 'lost chapter' of Capital) - but the same perspective is abundantly clear in Capital itself, as was demonstrated nearly twenty years ago in the article by Raniero Panzieri printed below.\n\nBorn in Italy in 1921, Panzieri's adult life (tragically cut short by his sudden and unexpected death in 1964, at the age of forty-three) was that of a theoretical and practical Marxist militant. His formal affiliation was to the Socialist Party (PSI), of which he became a Central Committee member and Spokesman on Cultural Affairs in the 1950s. However, Panzieri broke with the strategy common to the PSI, PCI (Communist Party) and left-wing Trade Unions, of a corporate alliance aimed 'developing' Italy through a 'planned' consolidation at national level of the 'rationality' that capitalism established at plant level. To ground his rejection of this Strategy theoretically, Panzieri turned in earnest to Marx. On the one hand, Panzieri made his own contribution to extending the Italian corpus of Marxian texts, himself translating Volume Two of Capital (which proved central to his understanding of capitalism); on the other hand, he supplemented the primary texts with a series of theoretical elaborations, at first in the PSI journal Mondo Operaio, and subsequently, when these articles created a tension with the PSI leadership that obliged him to leave Rome for Turin, in the epoch-making Quaderni Rossi, of which Panzieri was cofounder and chief editor Panzieri's most articulate, but far from definitive exposition of his attempt to grasp the laws of motion of capitalist society was published in Quaderni Rossi in 1964, the year of his death. Focusing on the labour movement's favourite categories, namely, 'anarchy' and 'planning', Panzieri's concern to undercut the dominant reformist version produced a dual thesis: first, at the social level, capital is not simply 'anarchy', but social capital; as such, capital was capable of planning, and while this in no sense negated the contradictory laws of capitalist accumulation, it should be abundantly clear that there was nothing inherently 'transitional' about 'planning' in the abstract. The complementary proposition of Panzieri's argument was that, just as at the social level capitalist planning remains capitalist planning, so too does capitalist planning at plant level. To the dominant Marxist view of productive forces as the autonomous moving-force of history, Panzieri counter-posed the view that \" the relations of production are within the productive forces\" And to the equally prevalent idea of the inherent 'rationality' of technology, Panzieri counterposed the \"capitalist objectivity of the productive mechanism with respect to the workers\".\n\nFortunately, the article in question has been available in English for some time now, so there is no need for further details. However, the reader may well find the discussion of technology too condensed; this is because Panzieri had already, in the very first issue of Quaderni Rossi (1961), devoted an entire article to this question: it is this article which is printed below. Its significance in the present context is threefold: first, it establishes the basis on which machinery is theorized in Capital; second, it contrasts the latter with the orthodox Marxist perspective that Panzieri labels 'objectivism' (his term for 'technicism'); and third, it specifies the political dimension to the problem in terms of class consciousness, strategy and revolutionary transition.\n\nIn the two decades since the article first appeared, Panzieri's pioneering work has been developed considerably, largely by others due to his early death. First in line came Mario Tronti, whose involvement with Quaderni Rossi led to the single most important book of the revolutionary Italian left of the 1960s, Workers and Capital. Following Panzieri's view of the \"capitalist objectivity of the productive mechanism with respect to the workers\", Tronti argued that a revolutionary class consciousness presupposed \"The Strategy Of the Refusal\"?

{"eta": "Most Americans think that miles of machine-planted row crops and crowded feedlots are required to feed everyone\u2014that without large-scale, industrial agriculture, with its chemical fertilizers and industrial-scale animal feedlots, people and the Earth would starve. But the truth is that the average American overconsume more than the average Brit overconsume. And in the face of these massive, connected agricultural and energy systems, we have political inertia, wasteful corruption, and the illusion that we can be libertarian eaters\u2014or feed-the-poor eaters\u2014forgoing fossil fuels and unsightly animal feed. \"Everyone\" eating high-protein, local, organic, local produce now includes's Carl Nolte, who says that he can eat whatever junk he likes on the cheap, but cannot tell you what his very low cost eats are. Also, the various developments in food science and the growing knowledge of our dependence on molecules that don't require energy to grow or move around, including soybeans and corn and wheat, are best understood as a product of the Far-Right's yearnings for an economic apocalypse.\n\nAs the antidote to the apocalypses, our ruling classes are grasping for new ways to restore the economy. The offshoot of this is privatization: the breaking up of national or regional industries. (The successful privatization of dams in the early 21st century and the rolling back of the regulatory state are exemplary. The end of the Dodd-Frank law is still pending, and the most significant, and controversial, parts of the law are what protect the banks at the expense of the rest of the rest of the free market.) More recent privatization plans have the rise to power of Wall Street, particularly Goldman Sachs, once the establishment target of progressive efforts to break up the financial sector. Another attempt to privatize the economy, now proposed by the hedge-fund tycoon Michael Bloomberg for the American public, is to sell off major energy projects.\n\nCapitalists seek to restore the economy to a position of supremacy by buying up the majority of the land, removing productive workers and living workers (and cultural communities), and pulling the economic cycle back down to the level of pre-modern society, when production led to a state of abundance and communal life. Most obviously\u2014that's how capitalist apologists portray the instability of capitalist economies\u2014what happens is that producers of products and services will switch from working at small scale to selling their goods primarily in large quantity (retail) to large corporations. This creates another class of \"offshorable\" workers, who are nevertheless supplemented by low-wage workers, the very old and the sick, who have to keep up with the demands of a bustling economy, and who produce for those companies that refuse to pay them enough to survive the day. In the Great Depression, in fact, middle-class wage-earning workers were forced to sell their own houses to earn a living. As the historian of corporate social relations, Robert D. Kaplan points out, the continuation of capitalism produces \"three or four or five hundred thousand Americans in a couple of years, the equivalent of an industrial economy that was once the same size as a large country today.\" Many of these \"non-working-class\" people, Kaplan argues, will never join the working class, and will find ways around the systems of wage labor and wage discrimination that prevent their transition from being in the Third World to being American. By focusing on big, organized corporations or families of bosses, even the desperate, many of these worker \"unions\" are excluded from having to battle these systems of exploitation and survival on the shopfloor.\n\nLiberal policy-makers \u2014 from President Obama and the Democrats to the League of Conservation Voters and Ralph Nader's Green Party \u2014 have made the commitment to fully abolish the economy and carry out the transition to something radically different, in which workers and residents of towns and neighborhoods lose their livelihoods to privately owned commerce and capital, while the world's crises and disasters rest on an unwilling capitalist class. This position puts liberal Democrats at the forefront of the opponents of libertarian policies.\n\nAlmost since the beginning of the 20th century, politicians and journalists have dismissed progressive grassroots movements as utopia fantasies, and conservatives have been all too happy to emphasize the shortcomings. But the vision that some of the most powerful political leaders of the past century, including the then president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, and the 18th century governor Thomas Jefferson, have hailed from the right (for example, that the head of state and head of the government be called \"the greatest magistrates\" and that no \"person whatever without humble regard for the dignity of his office,\" including even the president, should be above the law) has somehow yet to materialize. This was precisely what Roosevelt and the others meant by, say, \"the compelling need of every American to have a secure and remunerative livelihood.\"\n\nOf course, Roosevelt's vision is not \"an utopia.\" He had to negotiate it with the major industrial", "topp": "Most Americans think that miles of machine-planted row crops and crowded feedlots are required to feed everyone\u2014that without large-scale, industrial agriculture, with its chemical pollution and greenhouse gases and pathologically over-dependence on seeds from the American West, what would America look like, and how would the rest of the world view us?\n\nOn the big scale of a small and local farm, yet, artificial insemination and fertilization and widespread irrigation\u2014that is all. And GM technology has just progressed past that, having been embedded in food commodities not long ago.\n\nAs a type of long-term growth, it may make sense to ask what our environment is not the place to be growing our food. Instead of creating a new industry, or new corners of the economy, we can simply raise the land and reduce irrigation inputs in search of yields. And although most farmers could produce better yields in the years ahead, those optimists will be better placed to demonstrate how they can.\n\nThink about it: As our species multiplies rapidly, we are now feeding our livestock not with ordinary feed, as we did before, but with a cocktail of GMO ingredients, with a compendium of inputs, mostly of non-kosher origin that we couldn't call ordinary or diet-appropriate. That cocktail goes much further than conventional feed, should are you to believe.\n\nAnd in fact, this model of food production gets the inputs right: feeding livestock entirely on grain they own. The rest of the products in their diet are composed of simple sugars, corn and so on, and fat, dairy, protein, and other \"obesogens\". And unlike (a.k.a.) traditional agriculture, they pay\u2014taxpayers, non-farmers, and, for this publication, some farmers\u2014by property rights.\n\nYes, it is true that this scheme could lead to the traditional weeds becoming dominant, but because it is based on a system of property rights, it is not American\u2014it is the land society.\n\nAs Americans fill their Facebook feeds with rancher soul-searching about whether or not wheat or soybeans or corn or rice should be feeding the cows to improve their souls or their beef wallets, why not look around the world and ponder how in their minds they're the ones failing? If they fail to innovate, neither can we, nor can we continue the merry way to billions of people. But instead of taking any great risk to rollback GMOs, why not submit to the idea of expanding our food landscape even further\u2014by vernacularizing livestock, and agriculture, and food.\n\nFortunately, healthful, nutritious food is beginning to be standardized, notably under the so-called \"nutritious grains\" label. Those two can come together:\n\nIf we want to continue to feed a future population that is becoming more as a part of and dependent upon the land, then the future of the foods we eat is beginning to look brighter than ever before.\n\nAnd that while the richest countries are becoming far wealthier, thanks to increased agricultural productivity, rates of health have begun to die down among the poor in developing countries, and the rich countries aren't moving faster. The issue is class, and because poverty is rich. The agreement reached by the United Nations, World Bank, and UNFPA in 2013 is emblematic of a general trend.\n\nThe United Nations Global Status Report 2012 reported that malnutrition was 12 percent lower in 2012 than it was 25 years earlier. It showed clearly that malnutrition continues to be the biggest killer of children. The report said that it is still possible to do much to reduce levels of child mortality, yet we are cutting both the interventions and the action needed.\n\nWe are the longest-serving professional shot-callers. We have not been particularly good at making sure those who fail at the young age of five, lose the most of their capacities, and might as well not have anything; we have been \u2014and still are\u2014poor at identifying, and intervening early, to the damage to the most fragile children. The IPCC report said that in countries most in need of food, the policy gap is larger than at any time in at least the last century. How will we ever leapfrog to where the world is?\n\nOne might think of the people suffering, and the children in their care, as starving children on the streets, any more than they might see themselves as struggling, but we all, of course, are struggling. The tragedy of the commons we are warned about so often\u2014the problem of hoarding and runaway shopping\u2014is compounded by the suffering of our neighbours who have plenty, but cannot order themselves into the modern way of life. The suffering of our most vulnerable neighbours is not a problem to be expressed within the natural world we observe without much thought or nuance.\n\nIt is necessary that we break through the logic of our culture of poverty, and it is our duty to figure out how.

Here's why this is totally false\u2026\n\nHow Much Land is Enough?\n\nAs any of the millions of subsistence farmers and smallholders around the world will tell you, depending on the quality of your land and the size of your family, you can grow all the food you need in a very small space.\n\nIt simply requires designing a food production system that works with natural processes to make the most of what you have.

{"eta": "There is an image from the yesterday's nightmare in Boston which I cannot get out of my mind, probably because it's at once both horrific and holy. As first responders ran toward the scene, I wasn't necessarily aware of this anti-Semitic message found at the scene. It's a banner with a red star and the words \"Yarva Omori.\" The group's statement describes a historical incident of anti-Semitism; their call to \"fight the satanic powers that be\" is the Jewish equivalent to \"fill the shtetl with ofzera\" (nicknames of holy centers) - a reference to the idea of Hebrew Zionists who moved in to run the \"kosher\" country from the lands of their forefathers. It's hard to imagine a \"Yarva Omori\" banner as anything but a Holocaust denial book in its own right.\n\nHaving taken a look at some of the crazy things that people (Jews included) said about Jews in America right from the outset, and as I saw with my eye opened wide to the bigotry that seemed to be kindling in Boston, I decided to do a little research and speak about it on Facebook. After all, it's what people are talking about when their noses go up when something can't be confirmed. The same thing happens in any organization that uses a racial epithet as a slur or attacks Jews from its ranks. The European nazi movement was led by people who were still truly racist; they still existed. The men who carried the swastika in World War II were not the same Nazis as those we have been trained to view today. But they still hated Jews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've seen this bigotry a lot over the years. My children know it not only in the name of political correctness, but in the name of cultural sensitivity. In Europe in many, if not all, of the issues in their lives, I've seen the same logic once again. These young people wouldn't dream of associating with Jews in any way, shape, or form, even if it meant they had to work with other Jews who were racist and anti-Semitic.\n\nI also received a large amount of hate mail from people, the vast majority anonymous, arguing for a \"Jude Law Reform.\" When you look at the historical context of this radical practice - as the actual law of the land is always expounded upon by the Zionist movement to the exclusion of anyone else - the Jude Law Reform was no different. And because the country that considered itself the State of Israel is settler-colonialist, rather than open-minded about immigration, immigration reform is a foreign import. The historical context of the anti-immigration movement makes it impossible for Jews, who comprise the majority of those who are entering Israel today, to believe they are part of an existing continuum of history in which they are not at the heart of it.\n\nMost recently I had a very unsettling visit from somebody, I'm not gonna mention his last name, who is a well-known scholar and an outspoken defender of the BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) movement. He sent me an email just this morning \u2013 and it's a pretty good read. He interviewed some leading American intellectuals about BDS and the dynamics of what it means for people \"outside\" the movement. I'll spare you his pictures of ex-inmates screaming and urine-stained Israeli soldiers, but he has an excellent point about the BDS process taking an arbitrary but painful and obnoxious stance on Israel, not unlike the one I saw last year when I appeared on the Israel Democracy Institute's News With Views program (CBL) to discuss the subject of public spending in the United States for Gaza.\n\nDuring our discussion of what it means to ask a question about democracy in the United States, or that is in their and Americans' interests if Israel has every right to exist, he urged everyone to take on those Jews who don't want to see Israel undermined, even on its own terms. The ultimate \"queer\" people. \"Many Jews aren't willing to accept the possibility that a viable Palestine cannot be achieved - and that kind of an act of surrender is the ultimate substitute for anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the United States.\"\n\nI can't tell you what it's like to be in this frame - and I've never actually held a \"Jude Law Reform\" banner - but I sure can relate to this man's thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to ask - should I have known not to put \"Jude Law Reform\" in my Facebook profile picture?\n\nBDS is a plague on humanity, much of it a provocation. That's a very tough line to walk - which brings me to my next point. How can I possibly say that Judaism can't be a component or a subtext in BDS campaigns?

Then, leaving no doubt that he was going to die, he quietly stepped down from the podium and, with the concussive force of a bomb barrel, rushed at a crowd of innocents, pausing only to pick up another placard and whisper \"we're safe now\". This memorial tends to be prominently named and remembered \u2013 this week will see the second of two memorial events at the Boston Medical Center.\n\nThe words are chilling; \"the people of Boston have suffered too much and now so does the nation\". The murder of 22 Americans is a tragedy, surely, but sadly it doesn't mark the end of any battle. It's not an end, for some, it may never be the end but at least it brings a painful clarity to the pain inflicted upon a people by yet another \"worst kind of attack\". It is heartbreaking, to think that, in a matter of moments, so much has been lost but that we have as yet refrained from drawing attention to the US's long history of exporting terrorism.\n\nFor such an act of mass killing it seems sufficient to mention so often that \"America is a righteous nation\", though such talk misses the larger point. The US has made itself a target for terrorists for centuries. There is no doubt about it and, given that 77% of its citizens view terrorism as a threat against them or their property as a third, the US holds the greatest number of potential terrorist cells in the world.\n\nWe have been stockpiling weapons to disarm ourselves for some time. On the day of the historic Tet Offensive against the Americans in 1968, the US was said to have stocks of bombs equal to one million hand grenades, 23,000 grenade launchers and 750,000 M249 Nightsticks. Our weapons are being assembled in obsolete WWII-era factories. Our aim is to be virtually undefended from strikes and external attacks. But, lacking military might, we can no longer rely on the UN Security Council to save us. There is a lonely hope that a couple of tired dictators may intervene, perhaps not allowing specific attacks but certainly complicit in pursuing policies which will fuel terrorism. All of this is already happening in the Middle East. It was not too long ago when, following the Irish Democratic Alliance's electoral victory in April 1990, Lebanon expelled several of the old Shia nationalist leaders while their Baath party was regarded by the people of Lebanon as the most reliable supporters of Saddam.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that successive US administrations have refused to significantly intensify all forms of defence against terrorism, including the creation of global networks of spies, couriers, saboteurs and foreign individuals. True, during the Cold War all forms of covert action were intensified and attempted to destroy the Soviet Union and, if required, to depose Muammar Gaddafi. But as George Bush Sr's assistant secretary of state Lewis Lukens said: \"The new covert arms dealer now promises to hide the missiles that carry them, to turn off the eavesdropping and computer systems, and to run a Red line through the White House.\"\n\nIn a brutally complex and networked world, the subterfuge of grand paranoia is one of the most effective tools used to keep themselves hidden. Since 2008, the US has become increasingly reliant on its unelected allies. Germany had already received a lot of woe from the world as the current Isis invasions of Iraq, Libya and Yemen were apprehended despite the military's support being demonstrably miserable. These allies have repositioned themselves at the Chinese, the Iranians, Russia, Qatar and Turkey's behest. In November 2014, Turkey sent five special forces soldiers to Iraq after being asked to do so by the US and Britain. It is encouraging to hear that this effort is scheduled to continue as it did during the chaos of 2014-15, when thousands of volunteers made themselves combat suitable by fighting in both the US-led coalition and the lesser threat groups under its command.\n\nBut it's worth noting that we are seeing increasing numbers of people, of all countries and ethnicities, seeking to join Isis in Syria and Iraq. Among the new recruits are Iraqi nationals found to have fought with Iraqi militias, while reportedly elsewhere, particularly in Lebanon and Syria, we are seeing representatives of Palestinian and Israeli ethnic minorities. In July 2014, the UK Foreign Office circulated a report exhorting foreign fighters to \"consider the positive benefits of emigrating\" while in May 2015 we learnt of a network of conservative owners of suspicious hardware found in Beersheba promoting preparation for a jihad in the Levant. The most famous of them was Mark Duggan, who was radicalised by the howls of Isis gunmen: \"Duggan was in the first wave of foreign fighters to join Isis", "human": "There is an image from the yesterday's nightmare in Boston which I cannot get out of my mind, probably because it's at once both horrific and holy. As first responders ran towards the victims of the bombing, the \"cruel irony,\" as reporter Charles Pierce put it, was that \"the barricades meant to protect the spectators briefly prevented the EMTs from reaching the injured.\" I see the footage, and I can almost sense their desperation, knowing that people need help, and that mere seconds can be the difference between life and death. And yet I'm filled with awe. Just who are these people, doing the holiest thing a human being can do: running towards the injured and dead instead of running away from them.\n\nThere is something about seeing first responders going about their work that restores our hope in humanity. Just as importantly, there is something about seeing them that can teach us a lesson in theology.\n\nIn Jewish theology, the highest human ideal is to \"walk in God's ways.\" The Book of Deuteronomy mentions this lofty mandate five times, but curiously, it never spells out what it means. Modern Bible scholars tend to think that \"walking in God's ways\" is just another way of talking about obeying God's commandments, but the Talmudic Sages understood it differently. Their interpretation is something I suspect many first responders understand in an intuitive, almost visceral way\u2014which is why, from a Jewish perspective, they are theological heroes.\n\nWhat does being godly consist of, according to the rabbis? A well-known Talmudic text puts it this way: \"Just as God clothes the naked, so should you; just as God visited the sick, so should you; just as God comforted the mourners, so should you; and just as God buried the dead, so should you\" (Sotah 14a). To walk in God's ways, in other words, is to act in the ways that the Torah describes God as acting. Just as God is present when people are vulnerable and suffering, so should we be.\n\nYes, for religious people, study is important, prayer is important, and ritual, too. But what this text, and others like it, suggests is this: If you want to really serve God, and not just go through the motions, then learn to care for people in moments of profound pain. In many ways, it is easier to study, or pray, or build a sukkah\u2014or whatever. In telling us that offering care and comfort to people in pain is the very highest human ideal, Judaism alerts us to the fact that it can be intensely hard work. But it is also the heart of authentic religion and spirituality: To bring a little bit of God's love and compassion to the widow, the orphan, the Alzheimer's patient, and the bombing victim.\n\nNotice something about the Talmud's list. The naked are vulnerable, but their situation is reversible; the sick are vulnerable, but at least sometimes they can heal. Mourners have sustained an immense loss; nothing can bring back their loved ones. And the dead are\u2026 dead, and never coming back. Their situation is the very paradigm of irreversibility. Each situation the Talmud invokes is more irreversible than the one before, and hence, I think, also more frightening. Yes, the Talmud appears to be saying, these people's circumstances are scary. Stay with them instead of fleeing.\n\nFaced with a situation that makes us stare the depth and extent of out vulnerability in the face, most of us want to flee. Here, then, is Judaism's message: You want to serve God? Run towards the very people and places you most want to run away from. You want to be religious? Learn to be present for other people when they are in pain. All the rest is commentary.\n\nThis is what first responders do. Without calling attention to themselves or congratulating themselves, they run towards human suffering instead of running away from it. To walk in God's ways is to walk in their ways, too\u2014towards people in pain and not away from them.\n\nIn the days ahead, let's appreciate and thank the first responders\u2014yes. But let's also ask: How can we internalize something of their ethos, and their capacity for courage and compassion and care? We can pay them no greater tribute than that. And we can offer God no greater service either.\n\nRabbi Shai Held is co-founder, dean and chair in Jewish thought at Mechon Hadar.

A forest fire or volcanic eruption can fill the air with tiny particles that partially obscure light from the Sun and Moon. Once again, these particles tend to scatter blue and green light away, while permitting red light to pass through more easily. When you see a red moon, high up in the sky, it's probably because there's a large amount of dust in the air. Incidentally, Mount Zion was probably a volcano in a place called Jerusalem other than the Jerusalem we know of today. There may have been two Jerusalems ...the original one maybe in Saudi Arabia and the one we now believe is the original one in Israel. \u00a0\nAdded later.....\nThey believe that when it expels hot lava, Merapi is really sending golden carriages to the South Sea, the kingdom of Nyai Ratu Kidul (Queen of the South Sea), for the feast.

Jim also named the Dewar's No. 2 second best wine bar Distillers' Choice Award.\n\nJim won all three prizes with distilling assistance. \"Jim is easily the most well-known, admired in the industry, revered by the press,\" said Jim Murray in a released statement. \"He shares my view that the whisky market is now in turmoil and that much of the traditional private label sales will be broken. But Jim's wisdom is not about what to do \u2014 it's about what to do not to do. If we do not operate better than they do, we will also be in trouble.\"\n\n\"No single malt spirit should not only be tasty but also interesting,\" said Jim for his achievements and advice. \"Distilling your best single malt whisky doesn't mean you want to slam it down in the glass.\"\n\nThe two other winners to win the Distillers' Choice Award were Oceanus Whiskies, makers of The Skipper, an American blancmange and a day-old blend of Southern light whisky and spicy Tennessee spiced whiskey.

There were no winners\" according to Jim. At the press conference Jim said that \"we have got to beat (distilling equipment manufacturers) and I can tell you it sounds like there was no 'no' vote. In fact, there was a suggestion of 'bring in the wrong candidate.'\"\n\nJim Murray has been giving whisky judging for more than 20 years, having started at Glenmorangie before heading to a pot still at Glenmorangie. He has been influenced by aging and blending all his own spirits, including a was originally a cider maker, which he acquired from his son. For the Jameson 2016 competition, the Dewar's team used a similar setup as those used last year to judge a variety of traditional spirits, including gin, vodka, whiskey, port, kirsch, sweet, cordials and mixers. They awarded $1,400 each to three different blind tastings.\n\nAccording to Jim, the third and final round of voting came down on the first-past-the-post voting system with three to four people from each of the five age ranges participating in a range of tasting sessions with the different whisky as each reviewer broke them down into their desired whiskies and then told them which were outdistilling. The voters then added in their personal ratings of the whisky to determine the top finisher of each age range. With the help of an outside advisor Jim traveled to Canada last week to vote and met with judges at Whiskey Express Bar in Thunder Bay, then returned to Canada again to go for a full-throttle tasting of 12 of the 22 whiskies in all. At that point the six whisky will be selected and won by the number of votes that come in. The video available at DistillersChoice.org has Jim Murray telling the distillery industry why not to become the Aberdeen Beverage Association's Bottled-In-Canada.\n\n\nThe Dewar's team will then begin testing the whiskies this December. The final round of judging will feature a gill, match, five bottles each from seven different whisky makers. Four whiskies will be awarded the Dewar's Single Malt Whisky of the Year Award by Distillers' Choice 2017, an award usually given to the best single malt of that particular year\n\nFor more information please see DistillersChoice.org and a list of the awards for previous years.", "topp": "Today, whisk(e)y writer Jim Murray, the most well-known name in the judging of brown spirits, announced the winning whiskies among those judged for his annual Chalice Journals test.

They started with 10 brands, in chronological order of age, then went on to three bottles from each category (steward, Exchanged, and New Releases), with cut-off dates of 12/12/09-15/12/09 and those in the reserved category onwards, the bottlings which haven't been, nor yet are due to be, entered into the flava of competition. Jameson, Jameson Laphroaig and Laphroaig 90 Minute, for instance, won the jury award in the Reserve category and the Scotch Advocate's richest bottling of Jim Murray's finest made foils, Murray's New World Port, was selected as one of the \"Ladies' Choice\" selected bottles. These allowed the jury to judge from a range of different sensory impressions.\n\nAccording to Scottish whisky journalist Martin Robertson, the 32 judging whiskies were shaken by a unique lottery-like apparatus, with an automatic whisky sifter coming along too, in three locations. After blending the whisky, everyone downed their bottle until a final amount was reached.\n\nScots whiskey lover and British-born Oap Woodcock of Oapsfied in Queen's Whisky Festival, observed from the stands that, \"\u2026every part of the tasting went like clockwork\". People who were surprised (that's especially true, after the first event, where nobody ever reviewed a Scotch for 15-20 years) indeed had well-deserved experience judging whisky, said Murray. What he found most interesting was the way in which the \"bottom\" of the tasting structure was changed each time. In different years, the panel would vary \"matching\" the sets of different bottles.\n\nOn this occasion, handpicked, from the top down, \"feelers\" were sent by his family, and then a whisky writer, in Scotland. The jury then looked at the responses from tastemakers. Don't miss it: watch the video demo from 1:30-4:15.\n\nPhoto credit: Jim Murray\n\nAs additional shots of Jim Murray presiding over this literary event showed, he makes no secret of his greatness.\n\nThe prize of Best Scottish Whisky \u2013 which he won \u2013 was dished out by small independent producers Jim Murray and Craig Falconer, well-known in the UK for \"Colonel Collingwood\" whiskies. Jim's can't compete with the major distilleries but he does win some neat money for his family's contributions to whisky production. It's a bit funny to consider, but there he is in the distance, with the young whiskys and ham being transported from space in a Russian rocket and the Brownie getting hyperblasted, threw together together and sizzling, happy while it was done. At least with whiskey, the thirst for whisky is ameliorated when it's in, and occasionally the atmospheric chilly that is outer space makes it warmer.\n\nJim's passion for whisky was deeply etched in his youth. \"I was born in 1963 and almost died on Star Trek. That was a wakeup call for my mum and grandma. In there we went and looked at old films. They took us through Enterprise, Trillium, The Original Series, look at. We were always telling our parents that... I had a love for whiskies from an early age. I remember when I was four, my dad had the Highland Sun and some Angus whiskies. We went to a festival and I thought whisky was the wrong word there. But by seven or eight I had a drinking habit. Eventually I did it. What I can remember is cutting my middle finger off and dashing about a little bit. There's no way about it, there are few people today who would have done that.\"\n\nHis father, Harry of Glenlivet, also looked after his passion: \"That fondness and expectation for what [Heineken] offered on the back of it was a big, big force in the original Scots psyche, which we very much take into the present-day.\" We see the same appreciation of scotch but with the addition of Glenfarclas, a demonstration of what he would later declare this whisky has to offer that Scotch doesn't; the scotch tasting film from 1954 is a", "human": "Today, whisk(e)y writer Jim Murray, the most well-known name in the judging of brown spirits, announced the winning whiskies among those judged for his annual release of the Whiskey Bible (available November 24), his guide to every whiskey (over 1,000 of them) that he graded over the course of 2015. The guide is always controversial: last year Murray gave the top award to Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2013, marking the first time that a Japanese whisky took the title; he didn't include a single bottle from Scotland on the shortlist. This year, however, marks the high-water mark for Murray's controversy. The 2016 World Whisky of the Year is an offering from Crown Royal, a company that was second in US whiskey sales only to Jack Daniels in 2014. The distillery's new release, Northern Harvest Rye, scored 97.5 points on Murray's 100-point scale to take home the title. The runner-up is another rye; third place goes to an Irish whiskey, a first for the island nation; and again, no Scottish bottles made the top five.\n\n\"This year, doubtless there will be many more eyebrows raised because rarely is Canada mentioned when it come to the world's top whiskies. But, again, I have no doubt people finding the bottling I tasted will be blown away with this whisky's uncompromising and unique beauty,\" writes Murray. \"It certainly puts the rye into Canadian rye.\"\n\nThis last line hits hardest when you taste the Northern Harvest Rye yourself. It's no doubt a fantastic rye, but it's also a conservative one. It doesn't try to be anything but a pure expression of the grain, a benchmark for what rye should be, and a re-establishment of Canada as a contender in the spirit they are most known for.\n\nMurray is known for his no-bullshit approach to whiskey. He won't be bought (he now retains full copyright on any articles he publishes), and he won't follow trends, making for very controversial, and extremely influential, rankings. This year's top two whiskeys are both ryes, an unusual choice given that this type of whiskey trails far behind single malt, Irish whiskey and bourbon sales in America, but one that has been gaining intense popularity. Since 2009, rye sales have increased 536 percent, reaching over half a million cases in 2014, according to the industry group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, as reported by Fortune. The top two winners are not limited releases, sport no age statements and are relatively widely available \u2014 far from the exclusivity of typical spirits-competition winners and of Murray's picks in years' past. Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye can be purchased here and shipped to most states, and the runner-up Pikesville Straight Rye is a dressed-up re-imagining of Pikesville Rye, once a bottom-shelf rye from the Potomac region. Heaven Hill purchased the brand and put out a premium version of whiskey this summer, abandoning the old $11 bottles.\n\nThose who have followed the trajectory of Murray's Whiskey Bible, now in its 13th year, know that Murray has elevated discussion around whisk(e)y from America, Canada and Japan when offerings from those nations were considered inferior to the legacy brands of Scotland. He's pushed aside institutions and judged based on the merit of the dram alone, contributing to craft distillers' ability to be taken seriously in an industry once dominated by 20-year-old stocks of liquid from Scottish giants. But Canadian whisky is a different beast entirely, considered the \"Wild West\" of distilling. The bottles can contain both caramel color and additive flavoring, and there's no regulations that address the quality of the barrels, which can be new or used, charred or un-charred. World Whisky of the Year is an award he once gave to a 21-year-old bottle from Old Pulteney, a very traditional and regarded expression of single malt. Now the award has gone to something from a brand known for purple felt drawstring bags, owned by the liquor giant Diageo.\n\nAnd maybe that's the point. Fuck pretension. Fuck branding, backstories and who you know. If it's good enough, it'll win. And when it wins with Jim Murray, the whole world hears about it. Below are the top five winners from this year's Whisky Bible.

{"eta": "The Air Force is losing training time, experienced teachers, and its combat edge.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said the service would need to have more than 360,000 flying hours by 2025 \u2014 in contrast to today's 120,000. He cited the Navy and Marine Corps in a letter to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.):\n\n\"By 2025, our Air Force will need more than 838,000 flight hours \u2014 nearly 1,000 more hours of training than we have today \u2014 to maintain the world's most capable military aircraft fleet,\" the general said.\n\nThe problem, he said, was primarily part of a youth shortfall of commanders.\n\n\"We know over the next four to five years the military is about to add 90,000 male officers and enlisted men to our active-duty forces, which will be our key to maintain readiness,\" he said.\n\n\"This is going to require a significant increase in recruiting from our academy and officer corps \u2014 a very considerable increase in all departments \u2014 and we will not hit the speedline until we also increase pilot flying hours, flying student pilot hours, and adding the many additional positions that require training for a specialty,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the service faces an overarching infrastructure deficit that will cost it hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.\n\n\"If we don't address these funding concerns in the U.S. homeland security budget, both in terms of personnel \u2014 which is what's raising the most alarm \u2014 but also in terms of technology \u2014 which is going to be a big expense with security,\" the Air Force chief of staff warned.\n\nAt a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Tuesday, several key defense spending bills \u2014 Senate Bill 2224 and House Resolution 876 \u2014 propose $586 billion in cuts between them.\n\nThe House version cuts more than $19 billion from the Air Force's current, $542 billion budget. It also cuts $35 billion from Navy aircraft programs, and some $32 billion from Army programs. The House cuts the Army's global strike forces by a total of 75 percent, and the Army's, Navy's and Air Force's fighter aircraft programs in the same amount.\n\nThe House language also includes $1.6 billion to develop a new bomber, which would be its fifth bomber, and another $569 million to boost research and development of a missile-defense network.\n\n\"We should recognize that there are programs that are helping our Air Force not perform as well as it could perform and help our people at the fighter, bomber, avionics, radar, but also the tracking and analyzing software, the AIM-9X air-to-air, AIM-120 engine,\" Goldfein said.\n\nThe Air Force predicts it will have to cut at least 55,000 flights annually, or more than one aircraft per day, to keep its active-duty budget in line with its operational needs by 2022, according to an Air Force document that the Armed Services Committee reviewed.\n\nNo one is arguing that planes are going to crash, fly into one another, or that stealth technology may never be developed properly.\n\n\"We're talking about different eras of aircraft, particularly the F-35, which is a massively complex design,\" Goldfein said.\n\nThe Air Force said in its defense bill request that it would be able to keep some bases open in a fiscal 2016 budget deal that was approved by Congress on Monday.\n\n\"We will continue to maintain our close-in-area reconnaissance and protection capabilities despite our reductions in U.S. defense operations,\" the Air Force stated in its draft version of the bill.\n\nThe Department of Defense had plans to close or transfer more than 50 B-52 bases because of the continued lack of budget certainty for the past three years, the Army told Military.com in August 2015.\n\n\"It's a very uncertain period,\" an anonymous Army source told Military.com at the time.\n\nDespite the risk, the Air Force officials cited a small but growing number of Americans who are applying to military jobs that involve airlift, air refueling and cloud-based intelligence-gathering.\n\n\"It's new people coming in,\" Goldfein said. \"There's a hard turn coming in there.\"\n\nThe Air Force wants to have enough pilots to maintain its old fleet of 109 vintage jets, and it's looking to become self-sustaining and make other major changes to preserve or increase its capabilities as it faces a declining funding stream and increased competition.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon's top official said on Tuesday that the U.S. military was accelerating efforts to outfit the planes on the ground.\n\n\"Right now we're going to put quite a bit of new talent on the ground,\" Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in remarks delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said more than 400 personnel were designated to", "topp": "The Air Force is losing training time, experienced teachers, and its combat edge.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said that large U.S. forces, both in the air and on the ground, must have the tools needed to be prepared for possible operations. He also noted that U.S. military forces are deployed more and are at greater risk of attacks than nearly every other major country.\n\n\"You can't do the job of protecting against every foreign threat with just five or six forces. So we put more than 50,000 people in American airspace on the echelon to pick up the slack.\"\n\nDave Lapan, a retired Air Force officer, agrees.\n\n\"We have a global army of personnel on the ground that is both large and capable and able to swing from one mission to another,\" Lapan told the Spectator. \"We can probably kill half of the people in Iraq with air force and navy assets alone.\"\n\nFrom Iraq to Ukraine, a sense of urgency\n\nA major factor in this is the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where U.S. forces have largely withdrawn from their forward operating base and units are now being withdrawn from key central areas. The Kiev government accuses Russia of arming and directing the insurgency against the pro-Moscow government in Kiev and wants U.S. military aid to save the country from Russia.\n\nU.S. forces also face longstanding pressure from the Trump administration and its Defense Secretary Mattis to ramp up their troop presence in Iraq and help Iraq's army take more control of Iraqi airspace.\n\nYet the international coalition fighting Islamic State (IS) militants in the Middle East is unable to deliver a rapid decisive victory or turn the tide against IS over the long term, experts say.\n\n\"We also have to push the limits of what the UN can deal with quickly. It needs to be done with a great degree of professionalism, so the Iraqi military does not deploy foreign forces that will be hostile to them. It needs the back up, and air power, of the coalition as much as is done in this country. We have to expect this difficult talk and the stress of this long war to produce internal dynamics that are difficult to manage.\"\n\nMichael Knights, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and adjunct professor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, puts it this way:\n\n\"The United States may have hundreds of trainers, but of course there is no one prime minister or chief of army in Iraq to keep that training process going. That is a recipe for further delays in getting Iraqi forces the equipment they need, and therefore a broader global picture more complicated than is usually envisioned.\"\n\nKates is also concerned that the White House may use withdrawal of U.S. forces as an excuse to substantially cut back the NATO coalition's presence in Afghanistan.\n\n\"A potential analogy I often use is that now they get about 30% of their fire support for Afghan air force operations from about 30,000-35,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A very simple analogy is to how the tanks in World War Two became the armored division but did not add as much firepower at the same time that the Marines and the Army advanced in that same war. It was costly in time and material to provide more firepower,\" Knights told the Spectator.\n\nBoots on the ground and airpower\n\nIn 2009, the United States lowered the number of troops that could be stationed on the ground in Iraq from about 34,000 to 9,400 to help the Iraqi government take the lead in the fight against Islamic State militants.\n\nThe tension between Washington and Baghdad is often based on the question of how much ground American forces can retain inside Iraq. It is questionable, and in many cases dangerous, for the U.S. forces to simply retreat into the country, according to Lapan.\n\n\"For the past five or six years, I've been advocating the need for at least an ongoing U.S. presence in Iraq \u2014 we need to do everything we can to preserve what are people call de facto permanent bases. That's the best and strongest force in Iraq to deter and keep al Qaeda from succeeding. If we need additional forces, we need to deploy them as soon as we have a realistic possibility of protecting those bases.\"\n\nThis year, President Trump's administration has been more open about its desire to retrench, saying that the U.S. military may ultimately have to \"carpet-bomb\" more moderate factions.\n\nAnd there are people who say in addition to airpower and ground forces, the United States needs to step up its boots on the ground in the Middle East. One highly respected senior military source told the Spectator: \"We also have to push the limits of what the UN can deal with quickly. It needs to be done with a great degree of professionalism, so the Iraqi military does not", "human": "The Air Force is losing training time, experienced teachers, and its combat edge.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said his service could not surge enough combat-ready forces to conduct a single major regional contingency operation without stripping other regions of the airmen and aircraft needed to meet their basic security needs. He further noted that less than half of Air Force combat units are ready for \"full-spectrum\" (high threat, high intensity) combat. This lack of readiness could jeopardize the lives of aircrews and other service members who depend upon them in combat, and put mission-essential tasks at greater risk.\n\nHow did it come to this? Fighter force readiness has been declining since 2003, but it took a big dive in fiscal 2013, when funding cuts forced the Air Force to temporarily ground half of its active-duty, combat-coded squadrons and reduce overall flying hours by 18 percent.\n\nIt got worse. In 2014, additional cuts led to shortages of spare parts and aircraft maintenance workers. Fighter pilots, who once averaged over 200 flying hours a year, struggled to get 120 hours that year.\n\nLast year, the average rose to 150 hours with a slight uptick in funding and by rolling in the surge of flying time accumulated during combat deployments. Flying in a combat environment may sound like an incredible opportunity to employ and refine high-end skillsets, but it isn't. The vast majority of a fighter pilot's time in a cockpit over Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria is spent holding (loitering), waiting to be employed in that low-threat environment. While they fly much more frequently, the opportunity to actually drop munitions comes infrequently. And after they return home, those pilots often average less than one sortie a week.\n\nFly three sorties a week, and pilots are just able to sustain their baseline faculties. Fly four sorties a week \u2013 at least 200 hours a year\u2014and they get better at everything.\n\nTo put this into context, in the 1980s and '90s, Air Force fighter pilots averaged three to four sorties a week, flying over 200 hours a year in order to achieve \"full spectrum capable\" readiness. It enabled them not just to sustain proficiency, but to improve their skills.\n\nThere's a pretty well-accepted formula for this. When pilots fly only two sorties per week (averaging slightly over 100 hours per year), their skills decrease with every passing week and the likelihood they will be effective or even survive in combat drops precipitously. Fly three sorties a week, and they sustain their baseline faculties. Fly four sorties a week \u2013 at least 200 hours a year\u2014and they get better at everything.\n\nSimulators have improved significantly over the years and the fidelity, threat array, and contact ranges of fifth-generation sims overcome the challenges of limited range space and physical assets available in the continental U.S. However, the fidelity of F-16, F-15, and A-10 sims will never measure up to those available for the F-22 and the F-35. No pilot interviewed believed any simulator could replace the need for time in the air \u2013 it could only be used as a supplement.\n\nThe current state of Air Force fighter unreadiness is one we haven't witnessed since the Carter Administration.\n\nSo last year's average of 150 flight hours per year, just under three a week, means that most pilots are training to a level the Air Force considered not ready for combat in the '80s and '90s . Moreover, units currently deployed to (or spinning up for) the fight in the Middle East, are training for low-threat, close-air-support missions\u2014and that training doesn't sharpen full-spectrum skill sets. Once in the Persian Gulf region, whatever high-threat, high-intensity faculties they possess will continue to fade for the duration of their deployment. Upon their return home, they will fly as little as one sortie a week\u2014a rate that allows even mundane/administrative flying skills to become rusty.\n\nThe current state of Air Force fighter unreadiness is one we haven't witnessed since the Carter Administration. And the long-term impact of a 13-year starvation diet on the faculties, retention, and mindset of our fighter force should be setting off klaxons. But we aren't hearing any.\n\nWe can further note the effects on three specific areas:\n\nFaculties. Learning the ins and outs of executing fighter tactics, techniques and procedures requires hands-on knowledge/instruction which is handed down by ever-cascading generations of fighter pilots.

{"eta": "The Churnwalker\n\nThe Churn is a destructive, cyclical force in the Vainglory universe. When it grows out of control, no human can live long enough to escape its destructive cycles. The Churnwalker is the ultimate weapon of vengeance for those who have served the Lich King. The Churnwalker is a half skeleton half creature, with enormous claws capable of ripping holes through the earth.\n\nThe Churnwalker, like all power corrupts, wants nothing more than destruction. For a long time he has fought his enemies in secret with no fear, after all, the Churnwalker, and by proxy any unfulfilled servitude of his, can always be restored with the right item and the right event. With time and patience it is possible to work your way deeper and deeper in the depths of the world until the Lich King's inner circle is slowly erased of its corruptions.\n\nHow to play\n\nThe Churnwalker fights mainly with the Combustible Staff and Hammer. His most dangerous attacks are rapid footfalls, which keep you from standing still, and lots of melee attacks. You must be proactive and keep in your head the fog of war, allowing your teammates to see what happens.\n\nWhile leveling in the Azir Challenger League, the Gauntlet, you should build as much defensive gear as possible. For example when you are playing against the Terror, upgrade your Wristguard to Manareg and the Hiltguard to Cleaver. The Bandit, you can upgrade your Cyclops to Wristguard to keep him from being pushed across the map.\n\nYou will need these defensive stats in later matches. Try to pick the Barbarian so that you have them equipped at all times:\n\n10 MR/10 LCR/8 MR/8 LCR/8 MR/8 MR/8 HP\n\nSince the combined single target damage output is fantastic, you can trade more efficiently with the Cyclops by upgrading your Bladedancer.\n\nDon't miss the extra passive gold from the Gauntlet.\n\nAdvanced Usage\n\nThe Elemental Lord has a big choice when it comes to picking his Adept line. The first option, the\n\n\nEven though, you are a ganking potential juggernaut, you won't need to gank in many games. Since the Churn is a team oriented summoner, it's important to coordinate with your allies to balance out your team and ensure you get the benefits you need.\n\nThis usually requires an accomplice and a long push to bypass the field of vision the Churn offers. Since the Churn is capable of one kill in an extended teamfight, it often requires the carries to clear the area quickly. You should try and do this if you don't have an elemental carry or if the enemy team lacks a tank. Otherwise, your teammates should remain as close to each other as possible to avoid being caged. With the help of a good New Merit, a good kill tool and good positioning, you should ensure your team can safely emerge from a choke point or other secured area.\n\nIf they still have an aggressive jungler roaming, try to smooth out their paths before they reach you. You can set up a chokepoint, level your Hurricane Slice, and attack the enemy jungler in lane. That way, you'll gain CS from their enemy's minion wave while taking none of their damage.\n\nSince the Elemental Lord is a better support than a solo lane champion, you should consider increasing your burst based on the opportunities presented. For example, if the enemy is going for an early dragon, you can split push to bait out his positioning and get a kill.\n\nAlternatively, if you have both-stone here, be sure to approach the enemy lane with a minion wave. Use your high burst for pushing more aggressively with your cheap adrenaline boosts. Since the Churn has the largest amount of range in the game and has more active spell casting, you can back off to collect your blows.\n\nIn a team fight, your team should focus on clearing their own minions and stacking vision to funnel the enemy back to safety. If you are close enough, you can escape by using W or Banshee's Veil and quickly kill the Lich King with Lich's Gaze, Death Pact or Eye of Skadi.\n\nSkill Sequence\n\nAdvanced Usage\n\nThe Churn is not required to be able to solo queue so that he will have a high win rate when he reaches higher levels. So I advise that everyone begin their game off with their Combustible Staff to manage the mana, and only after the Churn is buffed should he begin his power.\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 Thornwood Sword + $5,000.00 \u2013 For Hitting something.\n\nLevel 3 \u2013 Hurricane Slice + $2,000.00 - For Preparing a Chain Gaze. + $750.00 \u2013 For Looting minions and Drakes. + $400.00 - For Tracking.", "topp": "The Churnwalker\n\nThe Churn is a destructive, cyclical force in the Vainglory universe.

When it grows out of control, no human can live inside it. It kills or infects anyone who comes into contact with it. One enterprising explorer entered the Churn wearing an environmentally-sealed suit and charted this unknown world \u2013 but became a monster in the process.\n\nThe Churnwalker is a horror straight from your nightmares. Early in his development, we decided that any words he spoke in-game would diminish his scariness. We thought about just having him make scary noises, but I grabbed the opportunity to construct a new language.\n\nThe Churn language needed to be a workable language, because I wanted to use it in the Churnwalker's written story, but also to be accessible in some way to our players. I began by choosing sounds and rhythms that sounded frightening to me, then decided on a conjugation structure. From there it was mostly a matter of following the verbs. I spent a few weeks muttering this creepy language to myself at my desk, freaking out the unfortunate people who sit near me at work.\n\nFrom the beginning, I wanted Roger Jackson for the role. I knew he'd take what I'd constructed and make it his own. I went into the recording with trepidation that quickly diminished when Roger entered the booth. My weird language rolled out of him as though he'd been speaking it forever! The Dehumaniser added a whole new layer of fun and inspiration to the process, allowing Roger to hear his voice transformed in real time.\n\n\u2013 Sarah Arellano\n\nIntro\n\nTeaser Trailers\n\nA series or trailers were created to tease the release of the much anticipated new character.

Normally, we would send out a new character to dozens of actors (via their agencies) to read for this part. However, we know that Roger was perfect for this role, so we sent it to him directly. We never looked back. Here is a video interview with Roger:\n\nSome will recognize Roger as the voice on the phone in the Scream movies. Others will recognize him as the voice of Mojo Jojo of Powerpuff fame. Roger has been the voice of some of your favorite characters over the years, and you may not even realize it.

Sarah Arellano and Jason Osipa from SuperEvilMegeCorp, produced, Dale Crowley, of Somatone, directed, and Michael Brinkman, of Somatone, was the Recording Engineer.\n\nWhile Roger Jackson was in the booth, we ran the Krotos Dehumaniser2 plugin on an aux bus so that everyone in the studio, including the actor, could hear the effect the plugin was creating, and the actor could work with it in real-time. This gave Roger total control over the final product, by allowing him to play off of the effected voice, and create the sounds that he felt worked for this character.

Last week, U.S. marshals shot and killed them, while passengers cheered.\n\nTo many, it's an about-face on Alaska's conservation role. The bear population, small in the past but increasing again thanks to outdoor recreation, is sustainable.\n\nSo does Giono, an alluring stuffed figure, full of dreams.\n\nOn the two large wooden supports he keeps on the platform, Giono blinks at the light and does his best to be inconspicuous. (Don McMurry/Alaska Dispatch News)\n\nThe bold movements are like his daily recreation and pose for polar bears as if for a selfie. Or, well, like many of Anchorage's would-be photo subjects.\n\n\"We want to sell tickets,\" said Josh Wood, whose 8-year-old daughter, Nicci, wants to take him for a summer shot. \"That kind of money is there for our family to splurge on vacations.\"\n\nThe welfare of polar bears has been a persistent question in Alaska. In March, a survey found 29 bears were killed because they were threatened.\n\nAs the father of three young kids, Wood is counting on the publicity and trade to keep him in Alaska. One business owner told Alaska Dispatch News that they're earning more each day from travel bookings.\n\nAlaska U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has spearheaded the fight to maintain federal funding.\n\nLast week, two polar bears \u2014 near the infamous Seymour Point harbor \u2014 were shot in two separate incidents. A pair of bearded seals also was killed because of concerns they were eyeing bobcats and black bears.\n\n\"What concerns me is what they're doing when a cub gets on the ice?\" Sullivan said Friday.\n\nStill, there are reasons to resist. For one, there's concern that making polar bears bear movie props might reduce the range for bears on the Arctic sea ice, because others will compete over who can pose in their presence.\n\nAnd with Arctic ice numbers melting fast, those stuffed figures are becoming scarce, with customers paying between $25 and $40 for a paper bag with two bears in it.\n\nIt's not surprising that the bears are becoming polar-bear problem. They're following a 30-year trend in which the plants they eat start dying. They're followed by a depletion of sea life that tamps down food for orcas and other predators, and by a loss of ice in which the bears travel.\n\nBut while the bears are lured by tourism, they won't be moving further north.\n\nIt's their fate to do so by at least 2019, when Arctic ice levels should be at their longest peak in 60 years, with bear summers here far longer than they've been. Polar bear numbers are decreasing on average per year, and white-handed bears are decreasing by the tens of thousands.\n\n\"There are times when there have been bear sightings, there have been grizzlies, but in general speaking it's a constant decline,\" said Cody Nash, a Northern Alaska Sea Grant program administrator, noting that temperatures as far north as Svalbard have reached a record low.\n\nSvalbard is the most northern sea on the planet; when it's an ocean, one for weeks at a time, the surface is clear of ice and the sea is open.\n\n\"A bear of that size can't get from Svalbard to Anchorage in the time frame they do now,\" Nash said.\n\nThe state was angered by the Governor's visit and the killings at sea because of the initial attack.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking,\" said Alaskan Trustee Dan Gilmour who has worked with the governor on polar bear issues. \"This is what can happen when the US Navy can't do its job, when U.S. marshals can't guard people.\"\n\nKilling polar bears on federal land is illegal, but Mr. Benson said the federal government has jurisdiction.\n\n\"In Alaska, bears belong on federal land,\" he said. \"To state control, that's not going to happen. I just don't see how these kids \u2014 who are raising the bears in Anchorage \u2014 can get better.\"\n\nWalker isn't appeased.\n\n\"It's almost like our federal government is abandoning us,\" he said. \"That's why people are coming to Alaska, so there's action at the state level that will continue to ensure the safety of these animals.\"\n\nThe two bears were killed both in separate incidents last month.\n\nThe president of the Alaska Wildlife Federation, Hil", "topp": "article\n\nAlaska brothers James and Giono Barrett have a dream: that some of the scores of cruise ship passengers who crowd the streets of the state capital each summer will be stuck with huge bills for the donations they give.\n\nThey approached Independence Deep as a way of handling the problem. They vowed not to follow the nation's \"donate, paywall\" practice, in which donations from individuals must be turned into a receipt by either the Internet provider or the credit card company. To do that, individuals would have to write a check for a nonprofit \u2014 Independence Deep \u2014 that then sends the check to a charity account of the nonprofit's choice.\n\nThat means that when thousands of people pour into the streets of Alaska for crowded boat launches or make evening stops at an at-risk shelter, instead of playing the waiting game in barbershops and flea markets, they can directly support new and existing charities instead.\n\nAs the idea took shape, activists and community groups were pushing for that problem to become a statewide matter. An Anchorage non-profit called Save Alaska in 2012 asked Alderman John Stirton to support making gift cards available free of charge for donations to 501(c)(3) nonprofits \u2014 including Independence Deep.\n\nBackers pitched the idea as a way to lure big-ticket travelers aboard a cruise ship or a homeless shelter and help help them make hefty donations to these organizations, otherwise at-risk or neglected in the state. The idea caught on. In August, Stirton and a community organization set up an account under the name \"Commit Alaska,\" and in October the first donation under that account went to \"Believe Alaska,\" a nonprofit that helps with outreach and business development for food deserts. The other first donation went to Alaska Energy, which was awarded $200,000 last year for repairs at its gas plant.\n\nShake a bottle to get steam\n\nJames, 26, and Giono, 24, from San Diego, and several members of their \"save Alaska\" organization have recently started investing some of the donations they pay to get aboard.\n\nThey paid $200 for three bottle tops and three silver plaques \u2014 about $5,600 in total. They paid a processing fee of $5 \u2014 and even went so far as to teach themselves a practice from visiting the ports of boats in the United States \u2014 putting a couple of teaspoons of soda in each bottle and then waiting about 30 seconds, Shakea said. The increased volume of fluid they are gulping enables the bottles to hold more bottle tops and plaques, he said.\n\nThe bottles and plaques were paid for by his car battery fund, which runs for about $2,000 a year. Since April, he has dipped into it about $1,000 through a brand-new car battery, he said. He says the performance has been incredible, he said.\n\nIn addition to the high-end booze, they got a copy of \"Prepare to Win: Winning at Life\" by Brad Sanders, and some other fancy snacks.\n\nShakea said they plan to continue to invest in better tools, not just the efficient bottle tops and plaques, but also new shipping containers so they can transport their consignments to Anchorage at \"less than 200 miles per gallon.\" That should increase the velocity and efficiency of their shipments to one every five minutes or less, from 40 minutes or less, he said.\n\nWorking and developing\n\nSistere Nora May of the Levittown-based Tindall Migrant Shelter, the landmark shelter for homeless youth on Long Island, said \"independent vessels\" were a natural fit for serving her clients.\n\nSalome Chaparro of Levittown, N.Y., is serving 75 percent of her clientele on boats.

At a meeting Thursday in Juneau, they will consider allowing marijuana retail stores statewide to provide separate areas of their businesses for onsite consumption.\n\nIt's the first time the matter has been addressed at the state level in the U.S., said Chris Lindsey, a senior legislative counsel with the Marijuana Policy Project. Recreational marijuana is legal in eight states and the District of Columbia. Denver is considering licenses for marijuana social clubs.\n\nEven if the Alaska board approves onsite consumption, don't expect to walk into a store on Friday for a sit-and-smoke. Retail stores must file applications for such a lounge, which includes how it will be separated from the retail operation and ventilated and what is the security plan. Many retail stores will also have to get waivers on local ordinances banning smoking.\n\nCritics fear an Amsterdam-like scene and pot spilling out of the retail stores onto streets and trails. They hope the state pot board on puts in place restrictions to keep onsite consumption from happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Barrett brothers in December opened Rainforest Farms, where Gorilla Glue \u2014 with a THC level of 23.8 percent \u2014 is their best seller.

{"eta": "University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison\n\nIn late 1998, a UW-Madison group led by James Thomson was the first to isolate and culture human embryonic stem cells, master undifferentiated cells formed during embryonic development in vitro or in vivo.\n\nThe technique, known as induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells, has the potential to become a tool for a wide range of uses, from studying diseases to treating diseases of the heart and brain and potentially helping to treat disease during or after fetal development.\n\nThomson's group quickly pioneered research on mouse embryonic stem cells, finding that these pluripotent cells could be as easily reprogrammed into pluripotent embryonic stem cells as embryonic stem cells. With the technique being developed in vitro by Thomson and his coworkers, the team was able to show that these cells could develop into normal brain, muscle and blood cells in a dish.\n\nThe U-M team has conducted experiments with mouse embryonic stem cells that have yielded important insight into early embryo development, the range of cell types available in embryonic development and new potential methods for studying cells and disease that may arise from them.\n\nAn international team of researchers, including students from U-M, has been developing techniques to engineer embryonic stem cells for use in these and other biomedical research. One of the newest approaches to iPS cell engineering has been to use a \"boilerplate\" design to engineer stem cells that can be further personalized.\n\nBy using a standardized boilerplate design and following a series of steps designed to process each step, scientists can significantly advance the efficiency of getting stem cells from a mouse embryo into the bloodstream of a mammal. This research is leading researchers to create a patient treatment for a disease called meningoencephalitis, a severe and debilitating inflammatory disorder caused by the infection of the Meningoencephalitis virus, also known as mononucleosis.\n\nStudent Work of Distinction\n\nKevin Swindle is a 2005 graduate of the Biomedical Engineering program.

Now, thanks to a National Institutes of Health\u2013funded Human Tissue Program research grant, the same mouse embryos used by UC Irvine researchers to create these stem cells now can be used to grow human cells in the lab, too. The research could lead to improved treatments for age-related diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, a mission the center is taking on in collaboration with the Parkinson and Age-Related Development Program at the University of California, San Francisco. While the UCSF researchers are developing iPS cells that can become neurons in the lab, the U-M scientists, using the mouse's original precursor cells, have found ways to engineer these cells into more flexible cells that can be differentiated into any tissue to provide stem cells that would be useful for scientific studies, including those looking at the development of brains and other organs.\n\nHarper Stearns was born in New York in 1938 and in 1963 went to college at Columbia University. During college he", "topp": "University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison\n\nIn late 1998, a UW-Madison group led by James Thomson was the first to isolate and culture human embryonic stem cells, master undifferentiated neural stem cells (NSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or mouse embryonic stem cells (MESCs) isolated from human and mouse embryos and extract them for further research. Thomson's system allows scientists to determine exactly when a cell has stopped growing, how long it has been isolated, and what stage in the cell cycle it is.\n\nAfter successfully isolated cells, scientists can then put them back together using workflows and cell modeling tools to explore how brain cells grow and differentiate.\n\nScientists started investigating GYM cells using a combination of techniques. The biggest challenges were research land mines: like finding the exact timing when cells start growing, or figuring out what chemical compounds work in turning off cell growth, Thomson offers lessons that come from experience and what scientists can learn from examples like human POMC, which was first isolated from a pregnancy.\n\nThe work also used different techniques: the \"enormous work\" was done with cell culture (which was technically challenging because it was done entirely by hand and involved developing several sets of reprogramming lines on mice). The bottom line:\n\n\"Using the best equipment available to us at the time was really critical to us,\" says C. Peter Chen, PhD, Ph.D., an associate professor in the UW Microbiology Laboratory (MIL) and the senior author of the research that formed GYM Cell.\n\n\"Now that we have the advantage of computer science and instrumentation for generating T3d and continuous flow cultures, we can make many more runs of these diverse systems in greater comprehensiveness,\" adds Chen.\n\nScientists hope the technology will give them new tools and insights into the development and aging process. \"We now have a greater understanding of how we grow these stem cells, and this allows us to understand how POMC and its precursor cells grow,\" says Chen.\n\nThe UW-Madison Group is one of the most collaborative groups of cellular biologists in the world. They formed the group in 2008 with the community being approached by Ted Ferguson, PhD, head of the CRETE project, which provides cell therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, MS and multiple sclerosis.\n\nTeam members have discovered a unique way to transition to cell culture. First, the cell is switched off so that cells for making cell therapies from it cannot be taken into consideration. In addition, the cells themselves can remain dormant and are treated as frozen and contain a load of sand.\n\nEnter students. More than 200 participants in a pilot study, invited by Ferguson, volunteered to engage in the project.\n\n\"We had seen something surprising when they were doing this experiment on the GYM team, so we agreed that we wanted to try it ourselves,\" says Richard Gabbert, Ph.D., a member of the UW-Madison GYM Cell team, adding that he chose to commit to the project after hearing of it through a social networking site.\n\nChen says that he discovered the project at its conception in 2008 after offering to help collaborators from his lab who lived in Louisiana. While doing research, Chen found that GYM cells were a welcome change to the cell culture that he had been previously conducting in a way that did not involve the use of nutrients.\n\n\"In Louisiana, we could never maintain those cells, or isolate them. So we donated our facility and provided the cells for them to do their experiment, for free,\" Chen says.\n\nUsing patient-controlled cell culture, Harris has been able to attain and maintain the signatures of the 17 cells from a patient's blood (retained via in vitro direct deposition), compared with those of just four stem cells chosen for extraction and cells use.\n\nHarris has also obtained the distinct signatures of cells which have become dormant such as 12 GYM cells taken from a woman who had melanoma for transplantation into her body. Cells from dormant cells developed into melanoma cells after transplantation. Harris's work unlocks a potential cure for melanoma in patients in the midst of the disease.\n\nTheir work would improve even more if they could obtain the cells from immortalized human stem cells so that their examination could be repeated to determine their origins (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2.

Access to human ES cells promises significant opportunities to study early development and could one day provide a near limitless supply of cells for transplant therapy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, UW-Madison atmospheric scientist Verner Suomi began to lay the technological foundation for the modern weather satellite through invention and ingenuity in the use of technology in space. His invention of the spin-scan camera enabled development of the geostationary weather satellite and gave us the first pictures of weather from space. Subsequently, Suomi invented technology for the processing and manipulation of satellite imagery providing scientists and others with powerful new tools for weather analysis and forecasting. The technology invented by Suomi underpins the weather images that appear on the 6 O'clock news and that we routinely take for granted.\n\nIn the 1960s, UW-Madison biochemist Hector DeLuca made the fundamental discovery that vitamin D is biologically inactive and must be modified by the liver and kidney to assume its active, hormonal form. Since, DeLuca has designed and synthesized a family of metabolites and derivatives of the vitamin D hormone. Drugs based on these compounds have been used worldwide to treat diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency, including osteoporosis and psoriasis. Most recently, this line of work has led to two drugs used to treat secondary hyperthyroidism, a complication of chronic kidney failure that can lead to heart diseases, bone deterioration and other life-threatening illnesses.\n\nDigital subtraction angiography (DSA), a technique developed by UW-Madison medical physicist Charles Mistretta, provides the capability to subtract the screening effects of bone and soft tissue in X-ray images and allows physicians to more clearly visualize the cardiovascular system. DSA has been the dominant X-ray technique for imaging blood vessels ever since its introduction to the marketplace in 1981, and doctors worldwide have used it to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Equally significant was UW-Madison professor Paul Moran's development of a method and device that greatly enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing much improved diagnosis of various disease states and trauma-induced injury.\n\nIn 1986, UW-Madison researchers Folkert Belzer and James Southard developed a synthetic solution, dubbed the UW Solution, for cold storage of organs to be transplanted from one person to another. Before the UW Solution, organs were kept alive with a blood-based solution that consisted of natural products. But because these solutions were natural, they could only store livers for six hours and kidneys for up to three days. A frequent result was organ damage, which could lead to chronic rejection or a recipient's need for dialysis. The UW Solution increased storage times for organs such the liver and pancreas from six to 36 hours, and up to 84 hours for the kidney. Longer storage times led to more organs being transported between transplant centers, more rigorous tissue matches and, ultimately, more life-saving transplant surgeries.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, UW-Madison researcher Dale E. Wurster developed an air-suspension method and device for coating pharmaceutical tablets. His work resulted in a widely used method for applying various coatings to pharmaceutical tablets to mask tastes and control the release of drugs in the human body. Wurster's technique is still widely used today to prepare granular preparations of pharmaceuticals for compression into tablets.\n\nUW-Madison researchers Mark Cook and Michael Pariza identified conjugated linoleic, or CLA, in the late 1980s as a potential anti-cancer agent. Because CLA is safe for people to eat, being naturally produced in cow's milk and red meat, it was designated as a potential nutraceutical. CLA is now widely used as dietary supplement, food ingredient and animal feed ingredient. Since CLA's discovery as a possible anti-cancer agent, on-going research has revealed a number of additional benefits, including CLA's ability to control body fat and enhance immune function. Other uses are now being studied worldwide in laboratories and clinical trials, and CLA has become one of the bigger nutraceuticals on the market.\n\nBuilding on work he began as a graduate student at Yale, Joshua Lederberg as a young UW-Madison professor in the late 1940s and early 1950s helped reveal the sexual reproductive capabilities of bacteria, and why bacteria such as tuberculosis become resistant to antibiotics.\n\nFor 400 years, mapmakers struggled to portray a spherical world on a flat map.

After a media circus for decades, President Obama will face two wars in Afghanistan, a legislative fight over gun laws, and a litany of issues that could cost him politically. In his first major address to Congress, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney laid out his agenda, seeking to cast, in a twist on his previous tone, to stand for simple government and lower taxes on the middle class. Obama was expected to stay in touch with the re-election campaign, as he did during the 2007 campaign. But this time, more of a presidential campaign would be at hand.\n\nSpinal Tap\n\nThe anthemic band released its now-iconic video \"Back in Time,\" this year. the website of the company's record label says it was created for political purposes.

However, a new album \"Novacane\" was produced and it should give enough of a boost to the metal legend, which includes classic songs like \"If I'm Not Kidding.\" It's been a while since the band put out quality metal, and could make them a metal hit in 2016.\n\nI hate myself for waiting\n\nGeorge Strait\n\n\"I hate myself for waiting,\" Strait said on the Grammy cover \"for a moment.\" The 25-year-old singer and comedian went back and forth about how he felt about his fourth album 'There's a Darkness' before the call from HBO. The wordplay in the cover image was particularly brilliant: \"I hate myself for waiting,\" he said. \"I didn't have the time to make it, so they found some other cover for it.\"\n\nEscape the Fate\n\nOne of these days, the Powerpoint presentation slide with this quote from Jay-Z and Beyonce is going to become an obsession at your workplace. As the slideshow explains: \"These two lassitudes - 'the fate of the human race' and 'all your shadows are worth as much as the stars' - express deep truths on the inner landscape of time, the history, and the destiny of individual life. Through a series of bold and meditative statements of purpose and the inescapable inevitability of some kind of error in the future, these authors can channel your own fears or doubt in the desperate quest to find the truth about the essence and destinies of their own soul.\"\n\nNew Orleans style\n\nA visit to New Orleans wouldn't be complete without a trip to the \"Stade de la Jeune Francis Marion\" (St. Joseph's Cathedral).

Unfortunately the insurgents on the Republican side are the extremists who, while right in finding fault in the establishment, seek to paralyze the political system rather than improve it. Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race for Speaker, and at this point it is difficult to predict how the Republicans will get out of this mess. It is even possible that Boehner will be around a lot longer than he intended.\n\nIt is likley that anybody in the Republican leadership would fail to receive enough Tea Party support to become Speaker, but McCarthy sure did not do himself any favors with his comment on the Benghazi hearings in late September. His statement will probably be quoted quite frequently by Hillary Clinton, who has a strong case in criticizing that witch hunt.\n\nUnfortunately for Clinton, she is also guilty herself of quite a bit of unethical and foolish behavior, along with violation of multiple government regulations. There is another quote mentioned in The Hill which Clinton will hope does not get repeated very often (emphasis mine):\n\nPerhaps Clinton has learned the value of distraction from Donald Trump; fresh off her comedy skit on \"Saturday Night Live\" she mailed copies of her book \"Hard Choices\" to the entire GOP presidential field with a cheeky note about them starting a book club together. She also spoofed McCarthy's blunder in an online video and her surrogates continue to rage about it on Twitter. But a Senate investigation has now revealed a second company that backed up Clinton's emails, and it has turned over its data to the FBI investigation into whether she mishandled classified information. Documents also show the first company is now concerned it may have deleted emails following the initial request the State Department made for her work records. One employee of Platte River Networks, which turned the server over to the FBI in August, wrote to another of concern that \"this whole thing is really covering up some shaddy [sic] shit,\" according to documents.\n\nNext week's debate has the potential to further shake up the Democratic race. The trend so far has been that the more people see of Bernie Sanders, the more they like him, and the opposite for Hillary Clinton. Politico reports on Sanders' unorthodox debate preparation:\n\nHillary Clinton has had aides lined up to run her debate prep for months. A Washington super lawyer is mimicking Bernie Sanders, and her top policy staffer is acting as Martin O'Malley. Sanders started studying for next Tuesday's event not even a full week ago. And that's because his two top aides sat him down in Burlington on Friday and asked whether he had a plan. Sanders has briefing books, a couple of meetings with policy experts and an abiding aversion to the idea of acting out a debate before it happens. He knows the stakes are high, his staff says. But the candidate, whose New Hampshire polling and fundraising prowess have put a scare into Clinton, is uninterested in going through the motions of typical debate practice. The Vermont senator's debate preparations, in other words, don't look a ton like debate preparations. While CNN is billing the event as a showdown, Sanders' team sees the first Democratic debate as a chance to introduce a fairly niche candidate to a national audience. So his team intends to let him do what he's been doing. Far from preparing lines to deploy against Clinton \u2014 let alone O'Malley, Lincoln Chafee or Jim Webb \u2014 Sanders plans to dish policy details, learned through a handful of briefings with experts brought in by his campaign. He won't attack Clinton personally but will instead identify where their positions differ \u2014 on foreign policy, for example \u2014 and try to leave an impression with viewers of the substantive differences between the party's two front-runners. \"You're looking at a candidate who has run in many, many elections who has never run a negative political ad in my life \u2014 and hopes never to have to run one. You're looking at a candidate who does not go about attacking personally, I just don't do that,\" Sanders said Wednesday. He's working to be prepared to stand his ground if Clinton \u2014 or O'Malley \u2014 comes after him. His team contends, though, that those defenses won't come through as pre-written one-liners. \"The one thing Bernie's not going to do is be a politician that delivers canned soundbites. That would be a disaster,\" said Tad Devine, the campaign's chief strategist, who met with Sanders and campaign manager Jeff Weaver last week to kick off the debate planning. \"And one of the reasons to not do formal debate prep sessions is it gets rehearsed.\"\n\nThis is quite a contrast from how Joe Biden has decided that, even should he announce that he is running, he does not plan to participate in the debate because of not having time to prepare his \"canned soundbites.\"\n\nUnlike Clinton, Sanders has been saying the same things throughout his career, and perhaps this has served as sufficient", "eta_suffix": " life put on a happy expression of scholastic achievement.

{"eta": "Extreme Competition Controls CDS\n\nUsually, reviews about sim racing controllers cover controllers that can be bought new and are being produced at the time of writing of the review. Not so with the Acer Aspire VX26-7440 and ASUS ROG Maximus VII Hero. Both are VR controllers that I have used for more than a year now.\n\nThe Acer Aspire VX26-7440 for example was released only a few months ago, whilst the ASUS ROG Maximus VII Hero was released several months ago. For a controller that has been around a year it is not surprising that these devices have finished their development and are now ready for use. The only difference with the Asus ROG Maximus VII Hero and the Acer Aspire VX26-7440 is that the Acer Aspire VX26-7440 does not support desktop mode. That may change, however, in time.\n\nKey Features of the Aspire VX26-7440\n\nController design and weight\n\nThe main design of the Aspire VX26-7440 is pretty much identical to the Aspire VX22-7440 and the Acer Aspire VX24-7510. In fact, the only difference between the two games' designs are the buttons located to the left of the base (as opposed to the right on the ROG Maximus VII Hero). The controllers are constructed using metal, as is the case for all controllers made by ASUS, such as the Zenbook Pro UX31A.\n\nThe only other notable difference is the size and weight of the controller, which is just 2.2 kg. Overall, however, the weight seems around the same as the Aspire VX24-7510, so it does not seem that large or heavier than an Aspire VX22-7440 without the corresponding backpack, but the high quality and innovative design of the model proves to be quite a positive attribute and a big achievement by ASUS.\n\nInnovation\n\nThe gaming aspect of the Aspire VX26-7440 is very interesting. Even though many other controllers also run on a keyboard/mouse and allow you to control many action in the game, the only controller that comes close to the control of Assassin's Creed Syndicate on a PC gaming system is a controller.\n\nThe Acer Aspire VX26-7440 is definitely more comfortable in my hands than other VR controllers, because its wide surface area is bigger and the tips of the buttons are much lower than those found on other controllers have. The case is constructed with the same modular design as the other ASUS VR controllers. The key switches on the top and bottom are interchangeable and act as the opposite grips for typing and playing in landscape mode in VR.\n\nMore important to note is that the game functionality on both the keyboard and the gamepad is pretty much the same. Because most people prefer to use keyboard and mouse over VR, what does change is in the way the camera of Assassin's Creed Syndicate is utilized. Instead that model is now positioned under the left thumb and presses down the A button for two seconds in landscape mode to find the target.\n\nHowever, if you find yourself playing with your hands in a tight space and press down more often than two seconds, then you might need to use the pad on your gaming controller to aim your shots because the mouse and gamepad on your PC simply cannot handle what I set one finger on the left pad of the gaming controller to do. You will need to use the buttons found on the right side of the keyboard instead.\n\nSound and noise\n\nYou can take a look at the audio quality of all VR controllers at the Audiometer review. In this test, the Aspire VX26-7440 was able to show impressive low and high range performance at 200 Hz and 20 kHz. Surprisingly enough, it was also able to handle the bass and treble of Sniper Elite VR to an exceptional level.\n\nThis controller has a decent sound quality for audio on a fast mouse or two.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn some scenarios, the Aspire VX26-7440 does do very good. However, it will still depend on your exact configuration and your usage preferences. When you have decided to use it in the console world, it should be able to do full performance in the resolution you put on it, regardless of your gaming device.\n\nIn other situations, the Aspire VX26-7440 certainly does a very good job on the controller, especially using the tiled layout. The accuracy and control in rotation has to be near perfect at all times by using the 6 axis wheel. It is only in the very worst case setting that you might loose the sensitivity of the joystick that is perfect for left, right and middle button presses.\n\nIn my opinion, that is a tough task for the Acer Aspire VX26-7440. This is due to how much you need to set up your control buttons, stick axis,", "topp": "Extreme Competition Controls CDS\n\nUsually, reviews about sim racing controllers cover controllers that can be bought new and are being produced at the time of writing of the review.

But $20 is a huge price discount compared to, say, this BattlEye Grid Microshark. Or, if you are a minimalist robot racer, the $10 RaceCAD module.

Not this review. This review covers a controller that hasn't been produced for about six years now. One that has only been sold new in 1995 and 1996. A controller that, after being used or having gathered dust for six years, is still miles ahead of almost anything you can buy new today. The controller that opened up the market for high end sim racing equipment. This review is about a sim racing controller that just doesn't wear, and that you will occasionally be able to buy through Ebay or sim racing discussion forums. I'm going to talk about Extreme Competition Controls' (ECCI) first controller, the Competition Driving System (CDS).\n\nI bought an ECCI CDS4000 myself in 1999, and ever since that day I'm trying to convince friends of mine to get on the high quality controller path as well. When I noticed a used ECCI CDS for sale last year, it didn't take long before I had convinced my friend Wouter van Geffen that he really should buy that wheel. To my utter surprise and joy, he did! My evil plan had succeeded: finally I could put this wheel to the test, and he seemed to be pretty happy with it as well. So, let's take a look at this six-year-old controller\u2026\n\nTHE WHEEL UNIT - OUTSIDE\n\nThe housing of the wheel is an almost round cylinder, made of a stainless steel construction. It's pretty large, but 'cute' at the same time and it just breaths quality all over. The 28 cm (11 inch for you weird measuring folks) wheel itself is covered with black suede leather and hand-stitched with a red wire. An instant \"I need to touch this NOW\" sensation overwhelmed me when I first saw the wheel on my friend's desk. The wheel unit just looks terrific, and like Steve Smith once wrote in his Indycar Racing II Strategy Guide: it should be part of the New York Museum of Modern Art permanent collection.\n\nThe unit is not equipped with shifter paddles or a shifter stick. Instead, the wheel sports four buttons facing the driver. These buttons function as ordinary joystick buttons and can be used as such. Usually you will use them for shifting and looking left and right, but of course you can assign them to any function, if supported by the sim.\n\nThe unit is weighing in at a massive 16 pounds and doesn't need a clamping mechanism to stay put. Therefore, it doesn't have one, which makes it very easy to put the wheel aside when you need your pc for other things than controlling your virtual race car. As if you would ever want to put this controller aside\u2026 what a ridiculous thought!\n\nThe wheel unit rests on two 'feet': one at the front, one at the back. The height of the foot at the back can be adjusted. This enables you to change the wheel angle, increasing steering comfort for different seating positions.\n\nTHE WHEEL UNIT - INSIDE\n\nThe beauty of this controller doesn't end on the outside: the outside is just a starting point. When opening up the unit and revealing the inside, it's getting even more impressive. A massive shaft is connected to the steering wheel on one side, and to a rubber tube (which is connected to the high-quality Clarostat potentiometer) on the other side. This is not your usual plastic crap: it's a 0.75\" massive stainless steel shaft. This thing won't break, nor will it bend. A block of ball barings ensures the steering will stay smooth longer than most of us will live. Just about everything in this controller is made of steel or aluminium. The construction is way overdone and doesn't look like it could ever break or fall apart.\n\nThe steering unit contains two springs: one is wound up when steering to the left, the other is wound up when steering to the right. These springs are sure not to break either: they're very thick, and winding them up instead of stretching them (what's done on most other controllers) is much better for the lifespan of the spring and guarantees it will never start producing annoying creaking sounds.\n\nMore beauty lies in the way the springs are used. The springs are not wound up in a linear way. The thing driving the springs is ECCI's copyrighted cam system. This is a plate, of which the curved edges wind up the springs when turning the wheel. Through this system, ECCI has been able to finetune the steering characteristics of the unit. The result is that the increase of counter pressure you experience is not linear to the increase of the turning ratio of the wheel. This is something that is pretty hard to describe, you'll have to try it to know that it really, really makes a huge", "eta_suffix": " is only in the very worst case setting that you might loose the sensitivity of the joystick that is perfect for left, right and middle button presses.\n\nIn my opinion, that is a tough task for the Acer Aspire VX26-7440.

{"eta": "I'm glad Jonathan Chait told us that his poorly argued, slightly paranoid New York magazine cover story, \"Why Race Has Been the Real Story of Obama's Presidency All Along,\" is now set to go away. I have not, however, been able to buy into the idea that these incorrect statistical claims are part of a wider conspiracy against Barack Obama. My eyes have been taken off the ball\u2014and to an extent that is increasingly fitting.\n\nLet's start with two paragraphs worth of my previous post, The Black Elite's New Black Superstars Are Just Not You, President Obama. You can't keep saying that the problem with Obama is his race and then turn your back on the number-one radio play of that song.\n\nA month ago, I said that because of the long and unfortunate trajectory of the \"Obama Derangement Syndrome\" narrative in mainstream rightwing circles, it is unlikely that it will ever be resolved. My former colleague Jim Geraghty wrote at the New York Daily News that even if we did find a \"silver bullet,\" it might never work:\n\nThe Obama quagmire is kind of like a perpetual tennis match, where he's always a forerunner, never a full partner. He's just too far behind everyone else, even his own foot soldiers, even if he's getting the same useful facts about his opponents that the others aren't. I asked why it wasn't enough to criticize him while he's doing this to get the right-wing media to at least take him at his word. \"Because if he insists that racism is not going on, then he's just not doing his job,\" says David Frum, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (a Reagan-era tax-cut crusader) and the author of the new book The True Believer: How Obama Became the New 'Partisan Devil'\n\nJoe Scarborough echoed that concern a day later: \"I feel that there is some truth in what he was saying, and that is part of why I think he may be such a candidate.\" I agree, and I agree completely. It is probably reasonable to assume that these Obama Derangement Syndrome stories will re-emerge as the 2012 campaign progresses.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that, despite the chatter and the false reports, the country is now becoming aware of racism far, far more quickly than it used to. In 2005, when we launched the Obama Derangement Syndrome project as a collaboration on the four-and-a-half-year anniversary of Obama's election, we declared the first one a big success, and then doubled that to four years after the election in 2012, by which time the following year was upon us. It was then possible to show that we had uncovered something positive on the political far right that had persisted for years.\n\nAnd so the Obama Derangement Syndrome narrative became only ever more vulnerable to skepticism. Why are there still people who think that the story about black criminality in the black neighborhoods that Obama built is somehow suspect? Why is that connection a dealbreaker for people in places like Milwaukee and Detroit? Why isn't it just as hard to prove that something not-so-subtly racist is going on in Indiana? How can we explain why there is still such confusion on the issue of economic mismanagement, even after that of the federal government, which now produces (albeit slightly better-than-average) economic figures?\n\nAnd I have a few more questions of my own: What, exactly, has happened to the bad-faith reporting, complete with inane conspiracies on behalf of those who don't think like conservatives? I recognize it's all partisan, by and large, but it has never seemed like what the left thinks of as good journalism. It isn't real journalism, either; it's selective, balanced and mendacious, and it has tended to feed the forces of distrust for the left. When I saw the script for the latest episode of This American Life, the viewer was immediately encouraged to support the platform to promote their own political beliefs, both true and otherwise. Do I have to tell you how good this was for leftwing advocacy in 2013?\n\nNone of which is to say that Obama Derangement Syndrome is gone. It's just gone. But it has enough zany flavors without being entirely unbelievable that it's hard for a world gone by to notice this. Now that Romney is supposedly a repudiation of a broad swath of Republican philosophy, Obama Derangement Syndrome is an entirely necessary narrative that would be unimportant were it not for Romney's divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail. His new ad was a smart and effective answer to Obama Derangement Syndrome, but Romney's debate strategy at the Republican National Convention in Tampa had been a gratuitous reiteration of all the caricatures and clich\u00e9s of the left, from the trickle-down theories of trickle-down economics and the trickle-down theory that Obama himself was a liberal elitist, the concept", "topp": "I'm glad Jonathan Chait told us that his poorly argued, slightly paranoid New York magazine cover story, \"Why Race Has Been the Real Story of Obama's Presidency All Along,\" was worthy of a start to the past season. It may sound awful, but the whole thing can be read in one sentence, complete with upshot of what it seems that we know to be true: in this New York world obsessed about Obama's blackness, what he really is is a black Kenyan (whom, remember, had his citizenship revoked for illegal activity). The deceitful scoundrel Jon Stewart took even more-defensive reading in his guest column and then, with Colbert, this past evening joined the chorus of excuses and objections to a recent blog post by the celebrated scholar Ta-Nehisi Coates: I know our racial politics can be agonizing, I know \u2014 there's no other way to describe it \u2014 it's an overwhelming existential longing of black people for those who have long been forgotten and despised, for those who have been molded to become an echo chamber, for those without any particular lineage but written in ink on a big white board; to black America, you are our president not because you have been born black, but because you are its flag bearer. Because in so many ways, you belong and therefore deserve to be President because you are the commander-in-chief and that is your birthright and the rest of us are the troops who protect you. Why? Because this country is founded upon the proposition that blackness isn't about destiny, that black people can freely relate to the white man, to protect and serve. Because your work is our service. What a fine sentiment.\n\nHe then offered up a piece that is more of a loose address: Do we really need to tell the story of the Obama presidency in terms of blackness? Why the fanatical uproar over the New York Magazine cover? And is it really so difficult to imagine a portrayal of Obama as a native citizen \u2014 and so we never learn his background or really know how he emerged from his Kenyan roots? Is it really so troubling that someone described him as \"heir to Indonesia's Sukarno\" and that which comes to mind is a photo of his favorite buddy Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4, Indonesia's leader? My only serious objection: If Obama had been born in Korea, wouldn't we know that this is how the nation subsequently imagined him after he came of age (as Lee Daniels paraphrased him): giving the appearance that he was something beyond a worthy supermodel? I know the point of \"race\" is to run from the concept, but it is worth savoring the irony: I think Michelle Obama's brilliant idea (unlike that of Shonda Rhimes) to have the Obamas all live on one continent makes more sense when placed in the context of the struggles of minorities after World War II. She loved to berate the African-American cultural establishment, observing how images of African Americans could make a mockery of those who had been moved, traumatized by an epochal tragedy, to create the kinds of life that were passed from father to son, husband to wife. The daughter of a butcher's son, her mind was made up. Obama wrote in Imagine: My Years Living in Cairo that in \"the American African diaspora we spent our hours glued to Dr. King's television ministry rather than listening to Nashville Sounds, pretending our life was other than it was. We rode to school with B. B. King instead of watching Bobby Seale. We belonged in Marion, Ohio, but we didn't belong to King's Black Panthers.\" That places a modern twist on her grandfather's distinctive 4 anforo that described the elder King's struggle against the corrupting influence of the entourages of the colonial powers that could not replace him (a story he picked up from one of the Rev. Dr. King's speeches). That is precisely how Michelle sees Obama, a born-again Christian in a Christian America, surrendering to to the ecumenical doctrines of African Americans and who, at the same time, shapes the man for an African America \u2014 she never forgot that description of Barack and that yearning that drew her to the school where he went to school until the day she got the job of Head of the Stray Dogs.\n\nMichelle's subtle touches are reflected in the darkened bedroom: Young Michelle's closet consists of a dress she hates and will not take off or throw away, two babies who have given them an opening, old clothes that bother her (reflecting her vanity at times), and a morning of reflections that she insists have nothing to do with modern life: \"where the plan moves me, my conscience asks me to be there.\" You will not find a photograph taken in early 2009 that better depicts this daughter of a butcher's son and also suggests her irrelevance. Or perhaps that is the point. Michelle Obama was not someone who slavishly followed the American dream, yet she wanted to walk in it", "human": "I'm glad Jonathan Chait told us that his poorly argued, slightly paranoid New York magazine cover story, \"Why Race Has Been the Real Story of Obama's Presidency All Along,\" was written before his epic wrangle with Ta-Nehisi Coates over Paul Ryan and the \"culture\" of black poverty. Because otherwise, it could only be read as the self-pitying rant of someone who has lost a historically defining argument \u2013 someone who has been \"sonned,\" to use Coates' term -- and is still too hurt to have access to his powers of reason.\n\nEven with the knowledge that Chait's cover story predates his debate with Coates, I'm not sure what to make of an article that purports to seriously examine the role of race in politics in the age of Barack Obama, and then compares liberals' claims of conservative racism to McCarthyism (specifically: \"the poisonous waft of the debates over communism during the \u00adMcCarthy years\"). \"Liberals dwell in a world of paranoia of a white racism that has seeped out of American history in the Obama years and lurks everywhere, mostly undetectable,\" he claims.\n\nThough Chait acknowledges that appeals to white racism have undergirded the modern Republican Party since the civil rights era, he insists liberals are bullies who refuse to \"acknowledge that the ability to label a person racist represents, in 21st-century America, real and frequently terrifying power.\" He singles out MSNBC for special scorn (full disclosure: I'm a contributor there), while never once mentioning Fox by name. \"MSNBC has spent the entire Obama presidency engaged in a nearly nonstop ideological stop-and-frisk operation,\" Chait writes.\n\nSee what he did with that \"stop-and-frisk\" reference? In case you've missed it, police departments in some cities have been accused of infringing the civil rights of blacks and Latinos by physically stopping them, and invasively frisking them, with little and sometimes no evidence of wrongdoing. It's kind of a big deal to civil rights liberals, of every race. So Chait tweaks them by accusing MSNBC of stopping and frisking conservatives \"ideologically\" \u2013 as in metaphorically and without consequence, which technically means not stopping and frisking them at all.\n\nIf you liked that comparison, you're going to love the whole piece.\n\nWell, that's if you can get past the opening anecdote, which features a clash between Bill Maher and Bill Kristol in which Maher claims the rise of the Tea Party is about having \"a black president\" and Kristol gets really mad and sad, and the whole mess is supposed to sum up the ugliness of American political debate. Clearly the angels are crying over poor Bill Kristol being hurt by charges of conservative racism made by a liberal comedian on TV. I think Reince Priebus ought to set the whole Kristol-Maher exchange to that Sarah McLachlan music the SPCA uses, and raise money for the RNC.\n\nHere's what Chait admits Republicans are doing wrong, with regard to race: Enacting restrictive voter laws in states where black turnout has risen. Refusing to expand Medicaid, which disproportionately hurts African-Americans (who vote Democratic). Lying about Obama cutting Medicare, which scares older whites (who vote Republican). Explaining the GOP's opposition to a Western-style social safety net, he even admits: \"The factor that stands above all the rest is slavery.\"\n\nAnd here's what Chait claims liberals are actually doing wrong with regard to race: mostly telling the truth about all of those things, while occasionally exaggerating it.\n\nI'm sure there are instances Chait can find where MSNBC hosts and guests (including me) went too far with racial rhetoric. But he certainly didn't catch me doing so in his piece: He chastens me for suggesting that when Bill O'Reilly asked Obama \"Why do you feel it's necessary to fundamentally transform the nation that has afforded you so much opportunity?\" the question was \"deeply condescending and borderline racist.\" Chait acknowledges my interpretation is \"possible,\" but insists \"it's at least as possible, and consistent with O'Reilly's beliefs, that he merely believes the United States offers everybody opportunity.\"\n\nIf Chait can imagine white political figures like Chuck Schumer or Sherrod Brown being asked why they want to change American policies when they've been afforded \"so much opportunity,\" I'll concede his point. He does make the fine point \u2013 I've made it myself \u2013 that President Clinton also faced intractable and ugly political opposition from the right. But he misses the fact that animosity toward Clinton originated with his segregationist enemies in Arkansas. Race has been behind GOP opposition to white politicians, not just black ones, who favor civil rights. Clinton is an example that actually weakens Chait's case.\n\nI also wonder whether equating liberals' complaints about conservative racism with actual conservative racism is", "eta_suffix": " and effective answer to Obama Derangement Syndrome, but Romney's debate strategy at the Republican National Convention in Tampa had been a gratuitous reiteration of all the caricatures and clich\u00e9s of the left, from the trickle-down theories of trickle-down economics and the trickle-down theory that Obama himself was a liberal elitist, the concept", "topp_suffix": "where the plan moves me, my conscience asks me to be there.\" You will not find a photograph taken in early 2009 that better depicts this daughter of a butcher's son and also suggests her irrelevance.

{"eta": "When, on 10 February 2014, we crossed the frontier between Serbia and Bosnia aboard a tiny Eurolines bus, one of our fellow passengers, a young man in his late teens, said hello, had a cigarette and said: \"This is my first time crossing the border with Serbia.\"\n\nWe got a ride across Serbia into Bosnia, and from there we took the train across Croatia and arrived in Travnik, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nIt was warm, and the train was quiet. I felt comfortable. But the man with the cigarette said: \"We don't want to buy tickets, because we are actually here to shoot each other.\" I asked him why? \"Why?\" he said. \"Because we are supposed to have an easy life!\"\n\nMy train was totally silent but the room was buzzing! I saw a single fellow cabin-boy in shorts and T-shirt and a couple of them had an argument in Bosnian and German and didn't talk right away; and there were a few people smoking in a cafe. It was so lovely. We were in Travnik, surrounded by Bosnia and Croatia, and I was happy.\n\nThe men would come and go into the other direction. One morning we had a shower (I had three), and a group of them were bending into a casket, picking their clothes out from their caskets and carrying them in and out; then, with others, they were setting up what looked like a coffin-piece on the ground and then installing their plans for the coffin into it. By the end they had it all dismantled!\n\nWe had stopped out in the outskirts of Travnik at about 0530 and we had to use our train card to get through, but we then had a breakfast and went back to the little town of Travnik. The driver said there were trucks outside but that we shouldn't wait on them.\n\nWe took the bus to see the train in the factory. The doors weren't opened, but I could see men standing in the doorway and others was sitting in the loo; some of them were not in uniform. I remember that some of them threw tobacco smoke into the air. I then went into the control centre, which seems a little primitive inside, and made enquiries. There were two men from Bosnia with blue goatees, some policemen, but mostly it was white guys and a few who looked like we were Bosnia. They told a couple of our staff to gather customers and it was turned into a small line for the police.\n\nWe approached the wagons and when they opened the doors and pushed us in, we saw that the destination was Bali, and that they were already an hour away from the new ticket counter. We left the bus and took a taxi to the new ticket counter, where after so many hours of waiting it was quite quiet, and they told us it would be another hour long and that some could book ten seats first.\n\nThey showed us all the tickets and on the ticket, they printed a date of departure. I'm not sure if there was any kind of calculator on the ticket machine. It was this very sign which described the buses. When they first opened the door we were taken away to the public waiting area and sat down. There were no nice ladies with white socks and the feet of the lady in jeans and boots, and there was no bra. They told us to stand in a circle and to be ready for our rides.\n\nA strange thing happened. Two or maybe three minutes after we came in the driver came and opened the door for me again, and this time there were ladies who were not in uniforms standing in a little line. They made a little bundle and put it on the seat in front of them and were ready to ride. Then they told us how they got to Bali, and that a old lady had to drag us away. But as I kept looking round, those ladies kept telling me there was another and a girl coming with a young man, and with the old lady. The girl was taking photos of us all, and then they got on their bike, and a couple of girls on their bikes were hitting the back wheel and just rode away without even looking.\n\nI almost got on the same one as the other lady, just because that one woman seemed really'mature' and had a great big pout, but nobody gave me a second glance. For some reason I was surprised when somebody said: \"Wait!\"\n\n\"You missed?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said, \"it was just that lady in shorts and T-shirt who let me down.\"\n\n\"Another lady?\"\n\n\"That young lady,\" said the guy in shorts and T-shirt, \"she let me down last night.\"\n\nWe parted ways again.

The world is against them.\"\n\nThe warlords, in other words, speak for the Balkan peons \u2013 whose every detail is monitored in the record of the Parliament, officially known as the Economic and Social Committee.\n\nThe police, too, look after the interests of their clients. But they also build up the warlords' networks. The policemen are recruiting their clients and rewarding them with trips to Kosovo.\n\nThis was the scene in 2002, just a few weeks after Tito's death, when a runaway from Kosovo carried a suitcase to Serbia, told his bus driver what he had done, received the usual round of threats from the police, and crossed into the EU.\n\nHow many sons of martyrs are on the blacklist in Europe's security fields? Who pays the price? And who is left above the fray? The secret policemen to the masses? Or the former Mafia leaders of the Balkans?\n\nPressure from above = 'police state', thus comes to dominate modern law enforcement in Europe. They have first to tap into the 'privileged space' (for now) between social surfaces. This move should be understood as a form of entanglement in the existing socioeconomic system.\n\nSome former soldiers send their other sons to serve in Bosnia\n\nCould the ethnic war in Kosovo have been avoided if the Kosovo Albanians had remained on their own lands? Was it then not a war between Albanians and Serbs but between the Serbs and Albanians alone? Were not the'red lines' drawn on ethnicity not thrown out by the blanket line of 'human rights'?\n\nWhatever the answer, the transition from official and parochial to gerrymandered choice is due at least in part to actions on 'outside the force' ground. Even when as a student I analyzed the roots of ethnic conflict and reported it to the authorities, the state only ceded the second half of the agenda to civil society. The first half is allocated to the pro-separatist 'family' of journalists.\n\nDuring the sanctions era (1993-1995), I was invited to give a talk at the Mikesevic University on'modernization of conflict resolution, reconciliation and transformation in international law'. This was in the occupied enclave, at home in a big city. As guests of a sociologist of the university, I was speaking about the process of demobilization, the psychological and emotional process used by each reintegration out of detention.\n\nI mentioned during my speech that Serbs are more and more resistant to the ideologies of 'love-hate' such as socialism, communism, fascism and so on. The consequences of which are an exclusive relation with their government that denies them basic rights such as more than salary and education. Also, because their compensation is conditioned in accordance with the status they occupied (by judicial dissolution or separation from the state), including the creation of special zones for Muslims, large numbers and bakers who deliberately attempted to create fear in the 'family', this exacerbates the experience of separation.\n\nA society that is conditioned to relate exclusively with its closest kin contributes the maximum amounts of repression to the 'unrelenting victims' of such ideologies. And even more the state embarks on systematic individual and collective torture. How do we know that the terrifying images of prisons in countries such as Uzbekistan, Tibet or Iraq are not some form of discrimination against other ethnic groups in these countries? It is because we know.\n\nThe week leading up to the Warsaw Peace Conference, the corridors in the crowd of delegates at the entrance of the Hotel Bialystok received a banner in red marker that read, \"Take it back.\"\n\nHow have the Macedonian exiles infiltrated the political process and ensured a positive vote on accession for Macedonia to the EU in May 2014?\n\nMP Fida Dohomo (Slovenia), with the answer of the one Macedonian MEP present at that time, Vojislav Seselj, that she was, \"a son of a prostitute\".", "human": "When, on 10 February 2014, we crossed the frontier between Serbia and Bosnia aboard a tiny Eurolines bus, one of our fellow passengers, a young man in his late teens, was asked to step down from the bus and disappeared into the police station.

After a 30-minute interrogation, they finally let him go. As he stepped back into the bus and it was clear he had definitely made it across the border, his joy erupted. Of course he was there! Like in Tuzla, like in Sarajevo, people attacked and burned down the government building, and it was a wonderful sight! Even better, in the divided city of Mostar, he saw people from both sides, Bosniaks and Croats, hugging each other in front of the burning building! He was hoping to be back in time for the plenum; he was constantly receiving text messages from his friends who were now in the streets in Mostar, and he could not wait to be there.\n\n\u2026\n\nA lot of people in February had unrealistic expectations. A majority of them thought that deep and far-reaching changes were possible and were going to happen in this short period. It was unrealistic to hope that a bunch of angry people in the streets could undo the developments of the past 30 years. I always recall this old lady with a red scarf telling us, very angrily: \"If this fails, I will never forgive you\". At the time I thought, \"What are your criteria for failure?\". You could sense that people really wanted a revolutionary change; a lot of people expected something very radical to change. But for a number of us who have more political experience, we knew that nothing so radical could really happen.

I repeat: the second period will be bloody, bloody in Tuzla! It started in Tuzla, it must finish in Tuzla. There is no other way.

(Interview with a worker of the Dita factory in Tuzla, member of Solidarnost \u2014 a new independent union \u2014 October 2014)\n\nAs they had long been doing every week, on Wednesday 5 February 2014 the workers of several privatised factories of Tuzla took to the streets to demand payment of months of overdue wages and social contributions. Most of them had been fighting for years, occupying their factories; several hunger strikes had even been undertaken, to no avail, and the weekly Wednesday demonstration seemed unlikely to make a difference. But on that day they were joined by several hundred young people. Together they tried to storm the building of the Tuzla canton government. The demonstrators managed to rush inside before eventually being forced back by the police. As clashes occurred, some workers were beaten up, and these images, captured on camera, went viral.\n\nBy the next day, demonstrations of solidarity were occurring in Tuzla, and also in Sarajevo and Mostar. On Facebook, groups like UDAR in Tuzla, and the page \"50,000 For a Better Tomorrow\", called for massive protests in the coming days. On 7 February, thousands of people turned up to demonstrations in all the major cities of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Sarajevo and Tuzla, after violent clashes with the police, people stormed the canton government buildings and set them on fire. In the divided city of Mostar they also burned the headquarters of the main political parties.2 In panic, the canton government ministers of Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica resigned.\n\nIn the following days, people started to organise \"plenums\" (assemblies) to discuss what to do next, and to formulate demands. Many more turned up than expected \u2014 several hundred in Tuzla and Mostar, often more than one thousand in Sarajevo.

Unlike in the Occupy and Indignados movements, the assemblies did not take place in the streets but in separate buildings. At each session, in each city \u2014 more than 20 cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina had their own plenums \u2014 long lists of demands were formulated, among them the end of privatisations and of golden parachutes for politicians, and the setting up of a \"government of experts\".\n\nA recurring theme in slogans, in graffiti and within plenums, was the rejection of nationalism.

{"eta": "When Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen moved to Byker, an English neighborhood in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, she was drawn to the laughter, the novelty, and the easy-going energy of the neighborhood, where she and two friends could visit in the afternoon. Most people there seemed to be so cheerful that they did not bother the stranger with questions about business; but at Byker, Konttinen and her three friends became absorbed in the activity of one man, a former solicitude worker for a hospice and later, a technology entrepreneur. In September, 2013, they visited the leader of that business, Peter Sherrington. Konttinen describes her visit to him in a brief to The New Yorker as \"the most riveting and riveting day of my life.\" After a few moments, they came across a dim gray door, and he opened it revealing an \"immense and flashy room\" featuring \"a huge leather-bound case, covered with scientific papers with everything from gay seeds to cross-breeding hybrids.\" Inside, Sherrington displayed a wide array of gadgets, the kind that work without the help of a computer. \"To my astonishment,\" Konttinen writes, \"I was ushered into a suite of different giant glass cases. Then, a grin spread over his face as he opened the door of one case to reveal dozens, maybe hundreds, of brown dog sores, each and every one a marshmallow, the very definition of perfection, each and every one encapsulated within the moist and powdery film that had been left around the bulbs.\" \"I went to Konttinin,\" Sherrington told me. \"I discovered she was an exquisite companion and found time on a Saturday night to observe her in her laboratory, where she engaged me in discussion about science, technology, politics, world affairs, and everything imaginable.\" Over the course of our hour together, he sent her many gifts, from records to works of art, and she and one of her friends sat at his computer and went over these works, giving him tips and suggesting interesting potential uses for new technology and materials. In the time that took her between the time of her arrival at Byker and her arrival back in her home, Konttinen's profile has risen dramatically. She is now a figure who is now mostly unknown, and who made news recently\u2014particularly in the United States\u2014when she wrote a guest column for The Times Magazine. Her story highlights how well known scientists can go about making a splash in the world if their work is very well thought-out. And though this is a thoroughly humorous piece, it also raises a subtle but powerful point about the way scientists should run their lives, which I have also argued in my essay in The Paris Review (which was published in the same issue as Sherrington's in the UK). It is clear that Konttinen and Sherrington met at a local nursery, but that by the mid-nineties, her position at the university was clearly expanding. Through sheer force of will she must have realized that working at the university, unlike working as a nurse or as an aeronautical engineer, had a certain kind of prestige, just as it is now virtually impossible to get a job in a high-tech factory. The university was a place where she could learn but also build prestige. And you have to put that together with the fact that Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen already was a celebrity\u2014her name was on T-shirts, she was a featured speaker at international conferences, and she was also the girl who on a long weekend in 1994 named the cell-phone security code from which the director of the NSA was able to spy. The association with Snowden was only part of the success that Konttinen was having in her life. But that success, I found later, came from something much more subtle: scientists almost always start a new project not because they are one another's idea of a genius, but rather they do so on their own initiative. Konttinen had first read about solar cell technology when she was sixteen, and by the time that she arrived at Cambridge, that seemed a very good idea to her. She was working with the 20th-century revival of chemistry, and the shift to it was, once again, obvious to her. \"We were able to successfully win a few experiments over the course of my freshman year,\" she told me. One of her professors had sent her a book by Wilfrid Thomson, a geometrical biologist who had produced incredible photovoltaic displays at Princeton and was making a comeback with a group in the U.K. She acquired a copy and spent much of her first year analyzing it for her thesis. The results were exciting, particularly the way that Thomson's diagrams showed that the amount of sunlight in any particular solar cell and the way the cells were applied to an array of mirrors could be the same, and in fact that the amount of solar energy coming into the cell would depend only", "topp": "When Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen moved to Byker, an English neighborhood in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, she was drawn to the laughter, the silliness, the joys of youth, of the wild, like-thinking years of urban life. Alas! in their coal-lamps and pickled toms, in the mud-plastered buildings and crabbed streets, in the painted alphabet on the windows, on the tramps on the A1 and the A2 and the E, in the alabaster scents in the city air, in the gay holidays at the Dardanelles, in the nostalgia for the bumble-bee, in the strength of the vaulting trees, in the wild summer evenings, in the youthfulness of the women and the youthfulness of the men, in the vintage seasons and all that is balmy, together with the German people, there was a constantly dawning of sunshine; a never- ceasing cry of yonder warm, perky hours, and the songs of men in the spring when the morning light came up, and the old Catholic bells began to ring over the moors and the Thames. Truly it was when an English landlord in the byword Home, a feeble, wispy ass, brought his granddaughter to The Rip in the Park, in the lunch-time and warmth of Holy Saturday, that they dreamed, and thought, and had the happiness, and the light of an English girl, to see the Red Sox play at Fenway Park, if the man with the backpack could not bring his own cat into the room\u2014in other words, to drink in the happiness of Anuloma and Anu, to read the endless tales of the red \"jerry plonks,\" and too passably say, while sitting in the carved birch-rug buttered at the far end of the four-hundred-square-foot garden, that the Red Sox are in the race for the World Series, and the story of how an English lawyer sues the owners for three fives, and then buys himself a bimmy, is ended. For these few brief and unimportant hours the dreamy, gently perfect Victorian parks and streets, and the charming houses, the handsome reading rooms, and the rare homemade delicacies, and the traveling fot the out- crowding wagons in the high streets\u2014all were alive with what seemed to be the enchanted presence of the fully-grown native youths, the loose jeans, the flowered cashmere trousers, and, much more, the vigorous and congenial agricultural masses. When Sirkka-Liisa was able to feel the warmth of an English girl's mallow cheeks, and her slightly-tanned, grey cheeks, and the slowly-stopping elongated shoulders, she was stirred out of her reverie. Packed in the Metro now, the child began to learn the game, to play with a new, a commonplace sport, and often even \"top\" her two \"fro[e]ed\" friends when a short play of baseball had failed to stimulate the busy carriage-merchant, on whose kindly bench she sat. The fellow ate a bowl of punch, and spat into the cup of the \"homer,\" and after a few strokes of his chopstick he called to some \"hang nut\" or \"dead langer\" to fetch a ball from the hand, and they sang, Or This is the Shropshire Ball, Dead Langer Shall Eat This, Kitten, Yookeb, Ziyng Sone Yookeb, Ziyng Sone the Wonder Which Shall Eat the Sun. Or the boy, sitting there with his pig- tail and filthy nose, who called, There Is a Battle He'd Like to Fight and Has No Wonan He Gathers His Friends to Ease His Pain, and did and did not fly, a battle where the bow and the arrow had at times been encountered. The trumpet-player said, Number Two to One\u2014 If One The Boy Says, Repeat or Close the Bird, Then One The Boy Will Give His Answer Not To Close the Bird, and Number Two\u2014No No, No We Shall Return To Once Upon A Long Ago Time And Begin Again.

For her, this blue-collar community brimmed with life.\n\nThen it was demolished.\n\nThe neighborhood's younger population moved elsewhere for work; many of its older residents, with nowhere else to go, simply gave up.\n\nMs. Konttinen moved on, too. She took on other projects in northeast England, photographing the beaches, Newcastle's Quayside, and a dancing school in North Shields. She returned to her native Finland for a year, photographing Scandinavian forests. Byker, it seemed, was tucked away in her past.\n\nByker Then & Now Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen On Thursday, we presented images from Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen's original series on the Byker neighborhood in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Read more \u00bb\n\nBut she had left a set of her original Byker pictures \u2014 a semipermanent loan \u2014 at a community center there. \"Five years later, I couldn't quite remember anymore where I had left it, so I thought I better go and retrace my steps,\" Ms. Konttinen said.\n\nIn the intervening decades, things had changed. New immigrants, many of them asylum seekers, had settled in Byker. It was a bit of a shock \u2014 while many cities in England were experiencing waves of immigration from all over the world for years, Byker had not. Nevertheless, Ms. Konttinen was struck to learn that her photos were helping new residents connect with the old neighborhood that she had first photographed in the late 1960s.\n\n\"They actually used my work as the bridge for them to understand where they had come to and what the history of the place had been,\" she said.\n\nCurious, she attended a few local functions \u2014 capoeira, tai chi, volunteering at an asylum seekers' support group \u2014 and was surprised that today's residents had an enthusiasm for the place that was reminiscent of her own, 40 years ago. Struck by their excitement, she returned with her camera.\n\nThe newer photos \u2014 a rare instance of color in Ms. Konttinen's oeuvre \u2014 reflect a more diverse community of immigrants and young families in their tidy, colorful homes. \"Byker Revisited\" is quirkier, but Ms. Konttinen's approach has evolved.\n\nShe found that people's attitudes toward photography had changed \u2014 a stranger walking with a camera is a bit more suspicious these days than in the '60s, especially around children. In the old days, when the community was small and \u2014 Ms. Konttinen admitted \u2014 at times a bit nosy, it wasn't long before she was well known in the neighborhood. But in the new Byker, Ms. Konttinen had to invest a year joining community groups and listening and collecting stories, before introductions turned into invitations into homes.\n\n\"The key, I think, has been that people get to know me as much as I get to know them, so there is a relationship,\" she said.\n\nAs a result, she was more collaborative in this series, giving her subjects a say in how they presented themselves. She asked them: \"If you have just one picture to describe yourself to the rest of the world, what would you have in it?\" She warned her subjects that even if she took hundreds of pictures, she would only use one to tell each resident's story. She'd set up her lights \u2014 sometimes tricky in tight spaces \u2014 encourage them to put on their best dress if they wanted to, and wait with her flash for the right moment.\n\nHow she used the light was also a way to obscure the acute consciousness of class that characterizes British social anxieties. (Ms. Konttinen, being a hard-to-place foreigner, was not plagued by such anxieties.) \"Often, if you go with the natural light and the fairly casual approach, you tend not to come away with stately portraiture, which is always afforded to the middle classes and the upper classes,\" she said. \"I thought it would be rather nice to offer something of a similar approach to the people in the humbler circumstances.\"\n\nSirkka-Liisa Konttinen/Amber Collective\n\nPhotographs from Ms. Konttinen's original \"Byker\" series will be on view at the L.

{"eta": "AIM-9M conscan seeker with MgF 2 nose window ( \u00a9 1999 Carlo Kopp).\n\n\nOf all the air to air weaponry developed in the latter half of the 1940s, the potent MgF 2 was the principal early weapon that eliminated the possibility of a direct hit of the targets by the 20mm. At present only two examples of the MgF 2 bomblets are known in the world. The original Russian MgF 2 was not as effective at engaging targets as the later MgF 3M and was mostly used for collateral damage. The second in the Russian stockpile is currently stored at the 103rd Museum in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.\n\nThe fourth and fifth rotary wing planes to adopt the MgF 2 are in the form of the Mi-8MTV4 and Mi-24 \"Hind\". Following the example of the early MI-24s of the Soviet Union the Turkish military also acquired two MG-19 pilotless attack helicopters from the Soviet and Finnish war chests. The first in 1961 (not a MiG-15), the second a year later in 1962 (MiG-17). The MgF 2.5 bombs appear on each helicopter under the designation \"Rafiya\" (Rising Sun). The signature of these bombs was an associated painting featuring the MiG-15 upside down on a mountain. Ml-21 Skyclan is represented in \"D-17\" on the left with another helicopter of the same type (Ml-19) on the right.\n\nThe presence of the M gf in MiG-17s allowed the rear gunner to fire on targets with greater accuracy than with the single 33mm gun of the ubiquitous 47mm gun of the Su-24. Four weapons (one 50mm gun with six 50mm shells, two 40mm guns or a VHF antenna) with a maximum range up to 300km were incorporated in the aircraft. The Thurdur was the only MiG-17 to employ three MgF 2.5 bombs in its range, although four additional ones were included in two serial numbers of 1982. These guns have an efficiency of more than 90 percent and are able to shoot a target out to 500m.\n\nAs the production production line moved beyond its construction, the standard equipment on an MGB was reduced to the weapons which were designed with a wide range of missions in mind, in particular under combat conditions in the face of heavy armour, against ground threats, and against fighters. The redesigned BUK began in 1980 with the inclusion of two more BUK launchers. These had a improved aileron extension, making it possible to fire the cannon shells more rapidly in place of the rudder.\n\nMunitions: 25 kg Mk60 and up\n\nThe variants of the Soviet GSh-30M, mainly MiG-17 or MiG-17BM (primarily MiG-17M2), are equipped with a load of Munitions: 25 kg of Mk60 and the total capacity to be carried about 500 kg of ammunition in the bin. While the military use of the Sukhoi rockets has ended, the launch of a third variant (known as the GSh-33) appears to continue in the Ethiopian Air Force, based on an advanced MiG-23 based on the aircraft produced for the IAF.\n\nThe primary ammunition used by the Soviet Union was the M86A series MGL 002, a Proximity Fumigation Laser that emitted high-energy pulses to blind enemy combatants. In flight trials GSh-33 aircraft routinely penetrated into the armour of their target. NATO defines the GSh-33 laser as comprising of a relatively narrow band (2.95nm) of blue light and a maximum beam width of 2.85 metres.\n\nThe missiles used to arm the MGL 002 missiles were manufactured by the Weisbaden Aero-Meteorological Services (AWAG), a subsidiary of Almaz-Antey which designed the MgF 2.5. They were internally identical but differed in the way the MGL 002 had its fins removed. They increased the maximum altitude of the rocket in the factory by 500-550 meters resulting in an improved distance range. The maximum altitude of the MGL 002 which could reach at altitude above 100km was around 5km and the payload of 15.8 kg has an experimental range up to a radius of 650km. The time for launch of the MGL 002 was closer to 12 seconds to the ground (which explains why no specific intelligence-gathering data was available during the test); even more precisely, the accuracy of the MGL 002 at the velocity of the rockets had been measured up to 500 meters.\n\nThe GSh-33 (Mk 33) variant was designed for air-to-air combat and is equipped with two Puirak S-1 torpedoes (coaxial torpedo tubes), a", "topp": "AIM-9M conscan seeker with MgF 2 nose window ( \u00a9 1999 Carlo Kopp).\n\n\nOf all the air to air weaponry developed in the latter half of the 1970s and 1980s, the supersonic precision guided bombs of FAB-500 were by far the most interesting and distinctive. Obviously inspired by ground based weapons and first served as an air-to-air weapon until much later, these were short-range precision guided bombs whose control and time of release is achieved using tracks on landing wheels. Since the FAB-500 is designed to appear as a single unit, the tracks can be mounted in either the fuselage or the wings, and thus a single antenna can be located on the fuselage or the wings. The air to air type of seeker used a centrifugal element that rotates in an elliptical mirror, and so a marker for one of the sides or or wings of a land base would always be located on the opposite side. The basic design was held all the way up to the whole of the later of the FAB-500s in 1988. These tried and tested guided bombs have the advantage that a disintegration design makes them more difficult to find and then execute without looking for them, so using a secondary kick to destroy them might be more difficult than using traditional \"hot shot\" methods. BS102\n\nThe fuselage shaped AC 15 glide bomb employed on the Korean Minju 2 rocket, has a flattened body and a main body shaped like a revolving piece of sweetspot we took a photograph of. The sides are round and the centre is spherical, i.e. a circle. The tail is of a concave shape. Following the model of the L-15KMS, it would presumably have weighed between 25-40t. Note that the tail breaks under the most severe g-loads. RB-52\n\nAs well as being designed for attack, the RB-52 was employed to drop most of the rockets to attacks on North Korean naval shipping ships in 2000. This bomb was intended for drops on the LCASY2, possibly a runway at Sinpo as a kamikaze version of the RB-52, or it might be an example of an actual RB-52 sample being employed for sea attack. Usually, samples are specially prepared for the drop, they are delivered to the target ship and the bomb is dropped directly over the ship. CN-11\n\nA to C model of a long range cruise missile with a ramjet propulsion system. The wings are swivelled 180\u00b0 and the body is open. The bomb features a pintle launching system within a box in the tail of the warhead, with a hollow engagement ring which can be folded up and fitted inside the box. This is a typical \"homogenous lorries before crossing bridges\" type of test bed carrying out relatively simple modelling. During the last months of development of the Hwasong-14, the shop was able to attempt to correct in many respects the design problems with a number of similar variants of both the DF-21 and the DF-19 to become all the improvements that the Chinese government actually delivered in the resulting weapons. For instance, the decision to eject an expended guided bomb rather than the internal filler charges previously seen (likely previously coming from the DF-26 wing mounting) and an automatic \"flash\" retrieval system to warn operators of potential enemy airspace is a great change from the prior practice in which the SR-82 was photographed under 20 hours of development for such a weapon. However, one might have expected the windscreen to be similar to that now available on the DF-19 or the DF-21, but the original Xian design carried a direct image aiming system on the forward part of the fuselage, so the CFD tester used a figurine of the same weapon, some time ago, in order to identify it. The short range \"long range anti-ship cruise missile\" was probably also intended to be armed with a diesel bomb fitting into an intensions to carry a high propellant warhead. GRAD-2\n\nIn April 1990, Russia introduced a new family of medium range cruise missiles. Considered the family's second generation, the GRAD was based on the S-75SL A and S-125 S-125. With a range of ~4200km the GRAD was represented under several production numbers. The main differences are: (a) it's believed that the GRAD is designed to rely on external ammunition carriers, without which it would be a no-fly zone since no nuclear-armed cruise missiles were available; (b) the GRAD's fairing is built directly onto the tailboom rather than being mostly made of covers; (c) the bomb is designed to fit into the volume of a Chinese nuke case rather than making its safety the \"equivalent\" of the LF-20; (d) the \"awakening rocket\" is replaced by a third type of nuclear bomb with a warhead of", "human": "AIM-9M conscan seeker with MgF 2 nose window ( \u00a9 1999 Carlo Kopp).\n\n\nOf all the air to air weaponry developed in the latter half of the 20th century, the air to air guided missile has probably had the greatest impact, affecting the design of weapon systems, airframes, propulsion and often leading to a complete reassessment of combat tactics. Air to air missiles (AAMs) differ principally in guidance, the two broad groups being radar guided and heat-seeking or infra-red (IR) missiles. Of the two categories, the second, by virtue of it's simplicity and lower demands on launch aircraft complexity, has become the numerically superior, arming high performance fighters like the F-15 or F-14 operated by frontline air forces, yet also equipping vintage 1950's fighters, defending Third World countries. The initial deployment of heat seeking missiles began in the late 1950's, with the USAF acquiring it's first AIM-4 Falcons and AIM-9 Sidewinders, however, it was not until the Viet-Nam war that the AIM-9 saw widespread use. The weapon was not as successful as expected, reliability was a particular problem, especially with the USN (repeated carrier launches and recoveries - quote ''banging them on the deck after every flight''), but when the missile did work, it was effective, which may be confirmed by a number of NVAF pilots who had the unique experience of a 'Winder entering the tailpipe of their sturdy Mikoyan, resulting in it's subsequent bisection. Current versions of the AIM-9 are a vast improvement, though they are to be replaced by the end of this decade by the ASRAAM - solid state electronics allow for higher reliability and enable the guidance to be ''smarter'' in between discriminating targets and resisting jamming. As their name implies, heat-seeking missiles home on to the hot areas of a target. The target will usually both reflect and emit infra-red radiation, which propagates through the atmosphere, losing it's intensity due to number of effects. This radiation is detected by the missile's seeker head, which, if the conditions are right, will then provide the guidance with the relative position of the target enabling the weapon to home in and destroy the target. In order to fully appreciate the problems involved in creating an effective weapon of this kind, we must examine the behaviour of infra-red radiation, the characteristics of an aircraft as a source of IR energy, the manner in which this energy travels through the atmosphere and finally, how the missile seeker processes it to gain information as to the target's position. Infra-Red Radiation The infra-red is a term used to describe a particular group of electromagnetic waves, those which are longer than visible wavelengths and shorter than microwaves, numerically the band between 0.8 and 1000.0 micrometres. This means that infra-red radiation has very many properties similar to visible light, it can be focussed or diffused, absorbed or reflected. The reason why the IR is so important is that it may be closely associated with heat and it's transfer from bodies. When we heat an object, or a volume of material, we are feeding energy into it - at an atomic level this energy is in the form of crystal lattice vibrations (probably the best way of visualizing the process is to picture an infinite lattice of tiny balls, each connected to it's neighbours by a spring, imagine then what occurs if we tap one of the balls) every atom vibrating about some equilibrium position in the lattice. To make things more complicated, in the physical world, the amount of energy each atom can transfer to it's neighbour is limited to an amount hf (h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of vibration) which leads to an interesting result - a heated body emits radiation throughout a continuous band of wavelengths, the relative amplitudes (levels) of each wavelength depending on the body's temperature. Graph 1. illustrates this relationship. This means that every object radiates energy, the dominant wavelengths depending on the temperature. As it turns out, objects at temperatures around and below 1200 C radiate mainly in the infra-red band, e in the higher the temperature, the shorter the dominant wavelengths. (note: IR radiation can also be generated by exciting a molecular gas, as the frequencies at which the molecules rotate and vibrate fall into the IR band - this type of radiation forms narrow bands in the spectrum -see TE Dec.1981, Lasers). Sources of IR energy The easiest answer to that question is - any warm or hot object- however, the subject deserves a little more attention. The single greatest source of IR radiation is the sun, however only part of this energy would be available to illuminate the Earth's surface, as large amounts are absorbed and scattered in the atmosphere, particularly by clouds and moisture. The Earth's surface becomes a secondary source of IR, as it is being bombarded", "eta_suffix": "); even more precisely, the accuracy of the MGL 002 at the velocity of the rockets had been measured up to 500 meters.\n\nThe GSh-33 (Mk 33) variant was designed for air-to-air combat and is equipped with two Puirak S-1 torpedoes (coaxial torpedo tubes), a", "topp_suffix": " onto the tailboom rather than being mostly made of covers; (c) the bomb is designed to fit into the volume of a Chinese nuke case rather than making its safety the \"equivalent\" of the LF-20; (d) the \"awakening rocket\" is replaced by a third type of nuclear bomb with a warhead of", "gold_suffix": ", the subject deserves a little more attention.

(The online runtime on Slender: The Arrival hits 30-minutes; imagine if you're taking a final-level walk through a breezy forest, encountering three perfect strangers who introduce themselves to you, to make sure you're alright.) A flashlight, a butterfly net or other measure of security maybe, ensures your safety, because often you will be in this dark place; A word or phrase unknown to you \u2014 \"No, THAT monster! You can't see that monster!\" \u2014 summons the devil from the dark and hatches your newest nightmare. (This message doesn't come until its 66th word \u2014 22 words after Slender's mask has completely darkened.) Your goal: To leave, or to stay for the first time in your life.\n\nSlender: the Arrival for PC is now available for download, and Steam is selling the digital version of the game for $9.99.\n\nThe first part of a four-part series on gaming addiction.\n\nHere's how Lucas Kennedy of BioWare describes the tone of Slender.\n\nI genuinely admire this type of work in general, and the special way that Pratchett did it. The appeal for me personally, and also for the writing in general, is the degree to which the world is revealed through the eyes and expressions of its very thin, frail character,\" Kennedy told Rock Paper Shotgun in an interview earlier this year. \"They're ambiguous, the expressions are emotive, and all of that feels new. You are struggling to read the text, and not just because there's a witch. Every character has something cryptic on her face and something emotive that her descriptions stick with, and as those hints start to bite, you start to read those things as parts of the world,\" the designer continued.\n\nKennedy also recommended that the SotA team analyze mod inventory options on a regular basis to readjust their game-play. I take that as a direct challenge. To write what someone says in this way about you before you read it out loud? No thanks. I can't, and will not, engage in a hasty personal assessment of an author's whims. Modding advice is one thing, but to pull together a genuine critique of an author's choices based on a detail of an author's work that never should have made it into the game? No thank you.

Easy to get started, the prep is just a couple of minutes and then you are up and running. Publisher says: Dead of Night is the roleplaying game of campfire tales, slasher movies and b-movie horror. It is a game of screaming victims, unstoppable killers and slavering monsters, where the horror movie clich\u00e9s flow thicker than blood and the only victory is survival.\n\nOkult When the characters return to Hometown they realize that they have repressed the memories of something. And that something has again cast its dark shadow over the town. Publisher says: Okult is a rules light GM-less horror storygame, best suited for three to four players. The players take the roles of people who are a little bit like themselves, returning to a town a little like the place where they themselves grew up.\n\nTen Candles\n\nPublisher says: A storytelling game of tragic horror designed for one-shot sessions. It is played by the light of ten tea light candles which provide atmosphere, act as a countdown timer for the game, and allow you to literally burn your character sheet away as you play. Ten Candles is described as a \u00abtragic horror\u00bb game rather than survival horror for one main reason: in Ten Candles there are no survivors.\n\nCthulhu Dark\n\nHighly narrative, simple rules, elegant execution. Allows you to tell stories where your descending sanity is the focus. You always succeed, but there are degrees of success. Simple combat system: If you fight something, you die. Publisher says: Cthulhu Dark is a rules-light system for Lovecraft roleplaying. The rules are fun and incredibly minimal: they fit on one sheet of paper. You don't need a character sheet to play, so you can start playing after two minutes of prep.\n\nFright Night\n\nPublisher says: Fright Night is a lightweight, easy to learn and quick to play tabletop role-playing game intended to evoke the feel of b-movies, slasher flicks, horror films, and even dark comedies. The players take on the role of typical, everyday people that somehow cross paths with a variety of malevolent entities that they must either defeat, escape from, or contain.\n\n\nOr, die trying.\n\nTrain, Hell, M1944\n\nPublisher says: This is a macabre scenario. It deals with themes of powerlessness, abuse and body horror. There is nothing fantastic in it. Its content is not pleasant and the outcome will, most likely, be unpleasant as well. Either that is your thing or it really isn't. WAR IS OVER The men who fought and nearly died for their country in what's come to be known as the Second World War are bound for William C. Borden General Hospital in Chickasha, Oklahoma, a grim warehouse for soldiers who don't fit the heroic narrative. (Log in to download)\n\nDread\n\nDread is an excellent system for horror oneshots. Conflict resolution is handled by pulling bricks from a Jenga tower, making every skill check hair-raising. Publisher says: Dread is a game of horror and hope. Those who play will participate in a mutual telling of an original macabre tale. The goal of Dread is to sustain the delicate atmosphere that invokes the hand quivering emotion that lends its name to the game. The thrill of a Dread game lies within the tension between desire and loss. You will take on the role of someone trapped in a story that is only as compelling as it is hostile\u2014someone who will find themselves making decisions we hope never to face in real life.\n\n\nViewScream\n\nPublisher says: ViewScream is a live-action game designed for play with video-chat software like Skype or Google Hangouts. Three to five players assume the roles of desperate people trapped in a world of high-tech horror. (\u2026) . The characters are separated (\u2026) \u2014 and they need to work as a team in order to survive. Players never refer to their characters in the third person; they remain in character the whole time. A typical game session lasts 60-90 minutes.\n\nThe Black Pram\n\nFreeform, free download. Publisher says: Lars and Helene are fighting for their baby's life. Every night a dark figure with a black pram waits outside their house. It waits for them to finally come out and give him what he wants. It waits for them to give up.

{"eta": "The Vancouver Canucks will look to record their fourth straight win tonight to equal their season-high streak when they host the Colorado Avalanche at Rogers Arena.\n\nThe Canucks couldn't come from behind in their last-game showdown with the Colorado Avalanche and fell 1-0 as the Avalanche scored three goals on seven shots to hang on to beat the Vancouver Canucks 1-0 on Thursday at Rogers Arena.\n\nThe Canucks also failed to win their third straight game, but they came very close in their three last encounters, all at Rogers Arena, a date in September when the Preds beat the Canucks 3-2. The Preds were coming off a 1-0 overtime win over the Vancouver Canucks in the Western Conference Semi-Final on Wednesday.\n\nThis year marks the seventh season in a row that the Canucks have matched their season-old run of victories. They haven't lost their last five games.\n\nVancouver coach Willie Desjardins said in his post-game press conference after the game that he thought he would be satisfied with the team's performance.\n\n\"I'm going to take a lot of satisfaction tonight. Our guys are going in the right direction. It's difficult to do some of the things they were working on,\" he said. \"I thought it was very, very important to focus on the things that we have to work on, and we did that tonight.\n\n\"Just being a bit more patient and I thought our guys made a commitment to doing them tonight for the rest of their careers.\"\n\nThat commitment extends to the coaching staff with Desjardins placing all of his hopes, and any possible exit plans, in the hands of his four new coaches.\n\n\"They've been so good. It would be very difficult for me to put them in a situation where they should be less successful and less successful with me. At the end of the day, this is just, this is the team that I have. I'm the one who's going to lead this team,\" he said.\n\n\"It's important not to look at the numbers. It's important, it's not about me. It's not about me going over or anything like that; it's about keeping the coach of the future that's going to be here. That would be disappointing. It would be hard to keep a coach that had been fired just because they're doing a good job right now and I'm not supporting the players but they're doing a good job. I keep telling them: 'Believe in me. I'm telling you the only way to get a coach is to believe in me.' That's how hard this job is. It's hard. I've had nine coaches in my career, so I'm never going to forget what this job's been like.\"\n\nVideo: VAN@BOS: Johnson fires in a breakaway goal\n\nWho's impressed Desjardins with what his team's achieved?\n\n\"The captain. His effort to help us win,\" he said.\n\nLast season, Sutter was elected captain of the Vancouver Canucks and, although he lost his job this year, the commitment the 22-year-old made when it came to playing the role was met with great success.\n\n\"He's going to get it done for us again. He put in a great effort this last game that showed the character that he had and we expect him to do that,\" Desjardins said.\n\nWhich coach will be fired is the question that is still not answered after Desjardins named Dave Tippett his coach on Tuesday.\n\nTippett was the coach of the expansion Vegas Golden Knights until their inaugural season. Since turning the reins over to Tippett, the team has struggled and currently sit dead last in the Pacific Division while top scorer Patrick Eaves is out with a knee injury that will keep him out until at least mid-December.\n\nLosing the veteran face in a coach like Tippett would be difficult, but the question of who that coach is remains elusive. Maybe Jeff Blashill will eventually be the coach of the expansion Golden Knights and when he finally does, we could be in for an interesting coaching race with Tippett, (former coach) Bruce Boudreau and (former coach) Gary Graham all vying for the job.\n\nWhatever happens tonight, and for one night, at least, the Canucks can move past the seven games which they're currently on the skids with last night's 1-0 loss.\n\n--\n\nTonight's game starts at 9:30 p.m. PT and is available on TSN 590 The FAN.", "topp": "The Vancouver Canucks will look to record their fourth straight win tonight to equal their season-high streak when they host the Colorado Avalanche at Rogers Arena.\n\nThe Canucks couldn't come back last game and had to settle for a 2-1 shootout loss to the San Jose Sharks on Saturday.\n\nThere will be no re-shooting this season as Vancouver moves on after sweeping the St. Louis Blues, Boston Bruins, Philadelphia Flyers, Los Angeles Kings, Edmonton Oilers and Tampa Bay Lightning and earning a 6-0-0 record in games decided by a goal or less.\n\nThey've scored more goals in each of their last three contests (10) than they did in seven previous games this season (8), with 12 coming in last weekend's 5-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nDefending Stanley Cup champion Chicago hasn't played since beating the Pittsburgh Penguins at Consol Energy Center on March 7, but they are one of the best teams in the NHL so far this year. Chicago is six points ahead of the Canucks and are chasing a seventh consecutive playoff berth.\n\nDan Hamhuis has three goals and three assists in six games and a plus-3 rating. Ryan Kesler has five goals and six assists and is plus-5 in 13 games. David Booth has been the team's top defenseman, plus-7 in 19 games, and is expected to be one of the top defensemen on the Canucks this season.\n\nBut the Canucks' bench, which has played just one game in total so far this season, has been better than expected. While it ranks last in goals-against at 3.14 per game, the Canucks, along with backup goalie Roberto Luongo, have turned in some strong performances. Luongo is 3-0-0 with a 2.38 GAA and.952 save percentage in the Canucks' last five games.\n\nTo make sure the last three games are as close as possible, the Canucks are on the verge of clinching their second straight playoff berth after defeating the Penguins, 3-2, at home on Saturday.\n\nInjuries: Olli Juolevi (ankle), Ryan Miller (lower body), Chris Higgins (ribs) and Michael Del Zotto (foot) are out.\n\nMonday's Game Notes\n\nCALGARY FLAMES (8-7-2) at Vancouver Canucks (6-7-3)\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. PT\n\nWhere: Rogers Arena\n\nTV: Fox Sports West\n\nRadio: TEAM 1310\n\nHow to watch: Canucks.com, TEAM 1410 AM\n\nThe Flames (3-10-2) trailed the New York Rangers 1-0 in the third period Monday night but came right back to tie the game 1-1. Jared Cowen scored the game-winner with 15.1 seconds left in regulation, then Jiri Hudler scored twice and Tyler Wotherspoon had the second two-goal half-hour of the contest. David Jones scored two goals and signed a six-year deal with the Flames this summer to stay in Calgary. Michael Frolik registered a goal and an assist in his first game back from a concussion. Tyler Wotherspoon scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Flames beat the Rangers 3-0 in New York Sunday.\n\nWhat they said:\n\nJiri Hudler said \"I think about this every game. It's an easy win in a hard spot, especially when you get your first power play. I guess I always hope for better than our record for the 3rd year in a row. I just want to win and hopefully we'll do something against Chicago and play more like this next week.\"\n\nTo honor former Defenceman Wayne Simpson, who died of cancer on Nov. 21, in a 2008 tournament with Team CAN, the Calgary Flames will wear Simpson socks with a story from his times in Calgary. Simpson was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline after 20-years as a member of the Flames organization.\n\nPrediction:\n\nIt's tough to make a prediction on either team after such a rough start. The Canucks have just three wins in their first five games, but they've been much more aggressive on the penalty kill. Last time they faced the Flames they had 30 penalties called to 15 for one goal. It will be close, but the Flames have to take it to Vancouver on the power play and force some turnovers.\n\nAlex Edler said \"you win some, you lose some. Some are games you shouldn't lose, some are games you should win\". They did most of that last weekend. They'll need to change their game plan in order to be competitive against a team that won it all last year in Calgary and has no question they can lead the Western Conference this season. Vancouver needs to take advantage of each one of those points it has. If it does, the Flames should still have a chance.", "human": "The Vancouver Canucks will look to record their fourth straight win tonight to equal their season-high streak when they host the Colorado Avalanche at Rogers Arena.\n\nThe Canucks couldn't have picked a better time to finally string together a lengthy win streak with all the teams around them in the standings also picking up points seemingly night after night. Tuesday's 5-2 victory over the Jets marked the first time that Vancouver has earned three consecutive wins since mid-January. They haven't won four in a row since the early stages of the season from October 26 to November 1. They'll look to do just that tonight when they close out their season series against the Avalanche, a team they haven't seen since November 4. The teams have split their first two meetings of the season, both of which were played in Denver.\n\nVancouver had several missing bodies at yesterday's practice including Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen although both are expected to play tonight barring unforeseen circumstances. Brad Richardson was a participant at yesterday's session but he remains questionable. Eddie Lack will get the call between the pipes as he looks to help his team win for the first time when wearing the maroon and cream colours of the Millionaires.\n\nPuck drop at 7 pm PT \u2013 Live on Sportsnet Pacific, TSN 1040, or online at tsn1040.ca.\n\nRegular Season Record 43-26-4 33-28-12 2014.15 Season Series 1-1-0 1-1-0 All-time Series 66-60-25 70-58-23 Last 10 games 7-2-1 6-3-1 Last 10 head-to-head 6-3-1 4-6-0\n\nScouting Report\n\nWinning six of their first seven games to kick off the month of March allowed the Avs to briefly flirt with the idea of getting back into the playoff picture but the three-game winless skid they bring into tonight's tilt has quickly put those pipe dreams back on hold. The Avs had really been relying on the outstanding netminding of Semyon Varlamov to get them somewhat back into the race. Varlamov went into Edmonton last night with a 6-1-1 record in the month of March to go with a 1.63 GAA and a .949 save percentage but those numbers took a quick beating when he was lit up for three goals and unceremoniously yanked from the game before it was even 10 minutes old in Colorado's eventual 4-3 loss. Coach Patrick Roy stated even before yesterday's game that he had planned to start Varlamov in both ends of the back-to-back. Those plans probably won't change given that Roy seems hesitant to give backup Reto Berra the call. Berra has only started eight games this season and not one since November 25.\n\nThe other thing Coach Roy has been able to rely on in recent games has been consistent offence from his top two lines, something even more critical for them after they lost Nathan MacKinnon earlier this month with what is likely a season-ending broken foot. In their last six outings, the top line of Gabriel Landeskog, Ryan O'Reilly and Alex Tanguay have combined for nine goals and 20 points while the second unit of John Mitchell, Matt Duchene and Jarome Iginla has combined for six goals and 12 points. Goal scoring has not been an issue for Colorado in the season as they have nine tallies albeit seven of them came in one game all on Eddie Lack.\n\nKeys to the Game\n\nAvoid the sleepy start. Just because the last two teams that won at Rogers Arena fell behind 2-0 to start doesn't mean the Canucks want to chance it for a third time in a row. Even though the team that has given up the first goal has won both games in the season series, the Canucks would be wise to try for a more traditional path to victory.\n\nKeep using the fresh advantage. Once again tonight the Canucks have the benefit of facing an opponent coming off a game the night before. The Avs have really struggled in the second half of back-to-backs this season winning just two of 10 games in those situations (2-5-3). Vancouver must pounce on a fatigued team that's also pretty banged-up.\n\nIggy keeps turning back the clock. He may be in the twilight of his career but Jarome Iginla is still putting up points like a young pup. He's hit the 50-point mark for the 16th time in his career and has nine points in 10 games in March so far. He also has a history of burning the Canucks on the scoresheet, including recording four points (2-2-4) so far this season.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n1 Goal needed by Radim Vrbata to reach 30 in a season for the 2nd time in his NHL career.\n\n3rd Time in team history the", "eta_suffix": ".\n\nWhatever happens tonight, and for one night, at least, the Canucks can move past the seven games which they're currently on the skids with last night's 1-0 loss.\n\n--\n\nTonight's game starts at 9:30 p.m. PT and is available on TSN 590 The FAN.", "topp_suffix": " did most of that last weekend.

{"eta": "After discussing Alexfrog's \"Profesional\" Anarch deck on the Stimhack forums, several of us had an exchange in which we agreed to disagree. Should you run 2 Power Monger or 2 Magnum Opus? Should you run one or the other? What should you include, as well as what to leave out? One key part of the discussion was the question of whether or not Anarch could potentially win games with just two Psychographics.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, both Powermonger and Magnum Opus are very desirable cards. They don't necessarily enable the same kind of aggressive strategy from Anarch; but they are very powerful for certain decks. Powermonger is a strong alternative to anything the Anarch Runner has; it is rare for Anarch to get more than one hand full of them, so its use in the deck makes sense. In the same vein, I believe that Magnum Opus is one of the most effective combinations of Cyber-Cards (if you are willing to give up Remand, it's actually one of the better in the game).\n\nInstead of discussing those two cards separately, it's time now to discuss Magnum Opus: \"What's In It?\"\n\n\nCredit to Kev21 for finding this list, and also for keeping the discussion on the Stimhack Forums.\n\nFirst up we have the most heavily Criminal-tied or \"heart\" card in the game: Scavenge. To my mind, Scavenge is a much better card than Day Job. There are a few other cards in the Criminal roster, like R&D Interface, that I believe make the card better, but I believe Scavenge on its own is quite well value.\n\nOn to the then-nascent Biotech idea that is largely ignored when discussing Anarch's potential. Biotic Labor, PAD Campaign, and Mentor all seem to have the same effect; which means that you can play two of them on a turn and put them on the bottom of your deck. It is usually played without consideration from the Runner, since it isn't a Curtain Wall (a high impact card) or an agenda.\n\nWith that said, \"biotic\" means \"in theory\" only. If you do a PAD Campaign and pass it to your opponent you still can do other things, only because you have been given permission to rez a card. If it works for you, I'm not sure that it isn't effective against Scavenge. You'll be the first one running out some Clot, something that is never as compelling as a PAD Campaign run. If you build your deck so to get a Clot run, then maybe you'll try for one of these run types. If you get Scavenged, then you might know what you'll try to run a turn later. In that regard it does look like a better card.\n\nAlexfrog's Control Anarch builds made it into the meta in early 2011; before Biotech, now it seems that the back of your deck is more often than not the goal.\n\nNow I'm not saying that Biotech is bad! I'm not! Biotech makes a lot of sense in some decks; but that is not the reason to play this. Your Control Anarch player can already do the \"big game\" with the cards in their deck and this card just makes the format MUCH bigger. You don't want to be able to say, \"If I get Scavenge, I can get the vote.\"\n\nWhen your deck is controlled more than your opponent and you have a bigger advantage (or so you think), then there is a tremendous amount of value to be had.\n\nIn \"control\" scenarios, you can only play Magnum Opus a handful of times per game. Your opponent can then freely take advantage of Scavenge on their own turn and be rewarded for it. For this reason, there is a portion of the Control Anarch player who seems to enjoy running Biotic Labor and that you can take advantage of Biotic Labor early while your opponent is at big trouble. Biotic Labor and Scavenge are a natural pairing, as they are both less expensive than their individual counterparts. You can use both against a Runner, but they are not as good for you as one or the other.\n\nIf you want a Criminal influence loss, then you should make it an Anarch deck. Perhaps you want an Anarch that is willing to take a little longer to break down a Blue Sun or an anonymous ICE and give you a clue. Because of this, I'm very much in support of Biotic Labor.\n\nWhen you play for control, a game of domination only happens when you have cards like Magnum Opus, 4x Scavenge, or any other trace elements available to you. And who wouldn't want that!", "topp": "After discussing Alexfrog's \"Profesional\" Anarch deck on the Stimhack forums, several of us had an exchange in which we agreed to disagree. Should you run 2x Note, and 1x All Willy? Are the other one rounds worth it? I was convinced that the others are just gravy \u2013 more icing on the cake. But then on a later scouting trip to Europe, with a spark of inspiration from one of our European friends, i decided i might take a different tack.\n\nAgain \u2013 the next thing we decided upon was a deck that reflected us both -aus g\u00f6r sinnt \u2013 and was a lot more choice and flashy. Most of the time you only would ever run one Ayes or a single Nutmeg \u2013 potentially with this aggro deck you will have at least 7 different copies of each you can name.\n\nAdditionally, there are several interesting things that the Anarch deck does really well:\n\nOnce you play multiple meat damage you can maximize your economy by stocking up Bankroll, then flip it over and pay on upkeep. Make it an engine and use it to generate their resources, then shift over to a Hostage if needed. Getting some funds out of you economic engine when you have 4 of a card is nothing to laugh at. This engine does get some expensive, and long term damage during the game (which is already in the strategic zone), but I feel that it is a great backbone for the deck to do so: What's it going to do?\n\nHand size is 1.8, you might have problems with auctioning and owning Equipment/Hardware on Auction, but at least you can put them to good use out of your hand. With hard land two-drop, on curve Winter Orb and this sweet butt of a fatty beast with...\n\nAverage target is Machine. Normal Angel attacks range from 11 -16 health, while Angel of Resurgence can trade for Murderous Cut. Harsh Rule by using 10 cards should break both at a normal pace of play.\n\nI come back to Alexfrog's advice \u2013 Boogiemoney does well with 6 xAgents\u2026\n\nWhat about price - can you justify the bread to get extra one.\n\nWhat's the difference between 2 and 6 meat damage? Does the Corp have any tools to pull in the meantime.\n\nAnother point that people, including one of the Britishers I met, raised for our deck was over just whether or not it was a bore to play. Is it possible it might be hard to get to the fundamental point that we had, and so not get anyone's attention or to be a grindfest?\n\nIn our case, two reasons supported it - the first being that we have a pile of passion and desire to win games. So we were going to stick it to No-Traditioners, not get engrossed by them. The second reason was that we had seen some arguments which suggested that we are pretty short on deck development, and so basically play a lot of games \u2013 so we don't get a good shot at winning at all!\n\nSo why [don't you have a million cards]!?? The point we had made was that many people are faster at getting to ridiculous authority level-ups than they are from meat damage. So while we can play Outpost is the permanent harder and the Architect acts as bounce, to beat a Corp and the ice of an HQ or R&D, it requires decks to be very innovative and diverse (and not inferior in other ways): this kind of deck is hard to build, which for us is against most Anarch decks.\n\nAnother thing people cited as a means to win was strength of hands. This is probably one of the most necessary points in every deck that you play, there is always the question whether you should play on a busted draw \u2013 like Faust, or whether you want to readings and don't want to risk losing twice. But also: Are you going to let your opponent do what they want to you, when their hands only give you 1 or 2 cards?\n\nHearing the arguments that decks need an accurate count against they're attack from the draws were heard, Nick and I, joined together with two other fellow Dutch comrades, agreed with the whole argument that: this deck has flexibility. We immediately set out to prove it!\n\nRamping up to 17 - xSynth did some good work (including going in our boxes for two day.) Not keen to shuffle!\n\nWill you consider our two versions of a red played on two different tiles in different colours?\n\nWe talk to people all the time saying: I used to play primarily white, but got to over account all the white cards just as soon as i could \u2013 and then tried to get in with Breakers and got nothing.\n\nIf you were looking to make a blue deck, would you use a good multitude of cards where your black had an out (Stealth Bureaucrat/Jackal/Night", "human": "After discussing Alexfrog's \"Profesional\" Anarch deck on the Stimhack forums, several of us had an exchange in which we agreed to disagree. Should you run 2 copies or 3 copies of an economy card if future draws of that card will be dead draws? Examples of this include Kati Jones, Professional Contacts and Magnum Opus.\n\nSingle-use cards are easy to examine. Take Daily Casts or Sure Gamble, for example: the value you gain with every iteration is the same. Reusable economy cards are more nuanced, because the earlier the draw, the more value you can extract from it over the course of a game. This is the argument in favor of running triples of these cards.\n\nHowever, there is a cost associated with running triples of potentially dead cards that is often overlooked. The future dead draw is not only a wasted click \u2014 that dead draw could have been a card that actually added value. If, say, you decided to replace the third Magnum Opus in your deck with a Dirty Laundry, one of the two future dead draws (a redundant Magnum Opus) will be a Dirty Laundry, a card that actually gives you value. Therefore, we should think of this problem as follows: the benefit of running a third iteration of a card is the additional value you would get from drawing it earlier, and this must be weighed against the value of a card you're not running in its place.\n\nBack to our discussion of Professional Contacts. Let's do some math and actually figure out the expected value of running a third iteration and see if it outweighs the potential benefit of a card we could run in its place.\n\nWARNING: There will be real math coming up, so I hope you brushed up on your probability.\n\nI propose we attack the problem as follows: calculate the expected value of the first copy of Professional Contacts over the course of the game when running 3 copies vs running 2 copies. The difference in value should be greater than the value of a card you would run in the third iteration's place. Fortunately our problem is simplified somewhat because of the linear nature of PC's return \u2014 every draw you make after it's in play gains you 1 credit, so every additional card you have to wait costs you 1 credit. Therefore, if we can calculate the expected waiting time until drawing PC in the 2-card or 3-card versions, the difference in waiting time (card draws) is exactly the value you gain when running three copies.\n\nThe expected waiting time for drawing a card when running three copies is (roughly, not exactly) equal to the number of card draws required to have drawn it 50% of the time. That is, there's some number of cards you could draw where 50% of the time you will have drawn at least one Professional Contacts. Here is the calculation:\n\nCards Non-PC Cards Left Total Cards Pr(Did not draw PC this draw) Pr(Did not draw PC ever) 1 42 45 93% 93% 2 41 44 93% 87% 3 40 43 93% 81% 4 39 42 93% 75% 5 38 41 93% 70% 6 37 40 93% 64% 7 36 39 92% 59% 8 35 38 92% 55% 9 34 37 92% 50% 10 33 36 92% 46% 11 32 35 91% 42% 12 31 34 91% 38% 13 30 33 91% 35% 14 29 32 91% 32%\n\nIf you're running three copies of Professional Contacts, then after seeing 9 cards you would not have seen one 50% of the time \u2014 to put it another way, within 9 cards you will see a Professional Contacts 50% of the time. This is roughly the average amount of time you will have to wait to see it in a game. Let's run the math for 2 copies:\n\nCards Non-PC Cards Left Total Cards Pr(Did not draw PC this draw) Pr(Did not draw PC ever) 1 43 45 96% 96% 2 42 44 95% 91% 3 41 43 95% 87% 4 40 42 95% 83% 5 39 41 95% 79% 6 38 40 95% 75% 7 37 39 95% 71% 8 36 38 95% 67% 9 35 37 95% 64% 10 34 36 94% 60% 11 33 35 94% 57% 12 32 34 94% 53% 13 31 33 94% 50% 14 30 32 94% 47%\n\nSo after seeing 13 cards, we expect to see a Professional Contacts 50% of the time. The difference in expected waiting time is the additional value you get from running a third Professional Contacts \u2014 therefore, we can calculate this as being 13-9 = 4 credits. A card that adds 4 credits of value to your deck puts it in the company of cards like Sure Gamble, something almost all decks run 3 of.\n\nConclusion: if you replace the third copy of Professional Contacts with a", "eta_suffix": " or an anonymous ICE and give you a clue.

{"eta": "Tony Mandarich was supposed to be a can't miss prospect when the Packers made him the No. 2-overall pick in the 1989 draft. The team released him after the 1989 season. During the year, he was converted to safety but was considered too raw to start and ended up on the practice squad. He went on to earn a pro bowl in the '90 season, but was cut at the end of the year before the Packers even got around to signing him as a free agent.\n\n4. As a player, Mandarich was a bit of a question mark. He was a receiver, but his height (6-foot-2) and long speed (4.58 seconds at the combine) seemed to weigh him down. As a safety, he had great cover ability with his run stop technique. He also had a 40-time of 4.56 seconds by the combine, which would have been a Pro Bowl selection had he not played a bit of safety in college. As a team leader and locker room leader, Mandarich was sorely missed.\n\n5. The Packers released him at the end of 1989 and didn't really go all out to replace him, but they had decided they needed new faces before they could test the market. Mike Holmgren became head coach in 1990, and a young defensive coach named Brad Childress started coaching linebackers. Holmgren didn't like Mandarich's football instincts; he felt like he missed too many tackles.\n\n6. He played all 16 games in 1990 but didn't make any special plays. He finished his career with 28 tackles, 9 sacks, five interceptions and 3 fumble recoveries. His arrival meant that Doug Whaley, Bill McCreery and coach Chris Palmer had each been replaced. Whaley was clearly the guy who was supposed to be the old Grady Jarrett-type head coach. He didn't have much success in his third season, though.\n\n7. Years later, Mandarich was given a chance as a rookie to start at cornerback, and he had a good year. He started three games in '91, and finished with 25 tackles, four sacks and two interceptions. The next season, he played in 14 games, and while he had also been good in college, he was outplayed for most of '92, when he was cut the following offseason.\n\n8. However, as good as he was in 1990 and 1991, he was let go in 1997 on questionable practice squad grounds, as coach Jim Caldwell was a defensive guy who was always looking for young talent. He signed with the Lions and enjoyed solid play the last few games of the season before hurting his knee. He was released in April and signed as a free agent again in 2005. It was the beginning of the end to his NFL career.\n\n9. A few years later, Mandarich was drafted in the fourth round by the 49ers in 2006 and brought back into the fold just in time for the '07 season. It wasn't an easy season for him, because of injuries. He started the first seven games, and had 3.5 sacks, and was named to the Pro Bowl after 12 games. He signed a two-year deal with the Jets after the 2008 season.\n\n10. In 2015, Mandarich ran a 4.77-second 40-yard dash, but was diagnosed with Lisfranc syndrome, a degenerative neurological disorder that affects his reflexes and visual systems. He was sent to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and his eyesight was so deteriorated that he barely noticed the end zone when he scored a touchdown on a fake field goal that missed. He played in just 4 games in 2015, which was a part of a 52-man roster that went from 90 to 45 players.\n\n11. Mandarich was released by the 49ers at the beginning of the 2015 season, and he ended up signing with the Browns the next year. Cleveland does not have any international players on its roster, so Mandarich signed with the Giants in New York. It would have seemed like a pretty easy landing spot for a little-used defender.\n\n12. At 35, Mandarich was traded from Cleveland to San Francisco in the offseason of 2016, and they now have a cornerback who can play. It is a very intriguing trade, in that it creates one role for both sides. The Giants end up being more active in the draft, while the Browns find additional upside and an international player who will have a year or two in the League.", "topp": "Tony Mandarich was supposed to be a can't miss prospect when the Packers made him the No. 2-overall pick in the 1989 draft. The team released him a year later to make room for Harrison. Once Jim Harbaugh entered the league in 1994 and began using the 3-4 defense as his calling card, Harrison became expendable. General Manager Ben Kercheval pulled the trigger in 1998 on Harrison, loading up on college talent that could help him tackle the retirement pain.\n\n3 Ben Gaston\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nHeight: 6-5\n\nWeight: 280\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 1, Pick 17\n\nGaston went five rounds before he made it into a game last season. The third-year player, out of Colorado, was near the bottom of the Seattle receiving corps, particularly after Beasley and Miller departed in free agency and Percy Harvin left for Tampa Bay. Due to the tight ends on the roster, Gaston was not given time to develop his skills and simply would not grow into the caliber of receiver he could have been. A veteran like Billy Cundiff or Jimmy Graham could easily fill his shoes. But the skinny yardage guy could go in the first round.\n\n4 Jabari Greer\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n\nHeight: 6-3\n\nWeight: 257\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 1, Pick 5\n\nThe runner-up is easily the best blocking tight end in the draft. His ability to bring a little bit of gravity to the offense is what separates him from the rest of the tight ends. He also knows how to get off blocks. If he can stay healthy, he could help the Vikings generate more value for Mark Brunell than they should.\n\n5 Martellus Bennett\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nHeight: 6-5\n\nWeight: 261\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 1, Pick 5\n\nIf we were to play out each and every call between Bennett and the Patriots this offseason, we would have been very impressed with what we saw of Gase last season in Philadelphia. One of the more exciting young offensive minds in the game, Gase had very high praise for Seattle's offensive line in their victory over the Eagles. The draft is full of young linemen, but a team like New England would steal a guy with the upside of Bennett.\n\n6 Evan Engram\n\nNew York Giants\n\nHeight: 6-7\n\nWeight: 302\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 2, Pick 2\n\nAfter a relatively average \"will he or won't he\" season in college, Engram quietly turned his freshman season into an outstanding junior campaign. His ability to not only block, but beat defenders makes him an intriguing talent. He should be able to develop into a top-notch receiver in the NFL.\n\n7 DeZ Love\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nHeight: 6-5\n\nWeight: 240\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 2, Pick 2\n\nThe former Georgia running back has good size (5-foot-7, 250 pounds) and an excellent catch radius. Is he a high floor, high ceiling sleeper? Watch out for him, especially in the second and third rounds.\n\n8 Cam Robinson\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nHeight: 6-2\n\nWeight: 245\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 2, Pick 1\n\nExpect to see the Jaguars let their running back take a few strides forward after rushing for 615 yards in 2016, but Robinson has some special traits. He's a big, quick-footed back who has good vision, and he's one of the few backs in the class who can take the top off of defenses. He could be the first player off the board at No. 2 after taking the Jaguars' two best draft-eligible receivers, Leonard Fournette and T.J. Yeldon, in the first round of the draft.\n\n9 Johnny Manziel\n\nHouston Texans\n\nHeight: 6-2\n\nWeight: 244\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 2, Pick 2\n\nEven after he threw for 419 yards in what was his final collegiate game, an athletic high schooler with good size-speed could be productive in the NFL. He made just five career starts, but gave the Texans a huge boost on offense after he took over at quarterback midway through the 2016 season. Although he doesn't have the raw talent of previous candidates who went later, the assumption is he will be selected in the third round of the draft.\n\n10 Germain Ifedi\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nHeight: 6-1\n\nWeight: 310\n\nProjected Round (2017): Round 2, Pick 2\n\nIfedi should be a name you are familiar with.

The team released him four years later. Credit: File\n\nBy ,\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have been making No. 1 selections in the National Football League draft since 1936.\n\nFrom Curly Lambeau to Ted Thompson, the Packers decision-makers have carefully attempted to make the best selection possible with their coveted first-round pick. Guard Russ Letlow from the University of San Francisco was Green Bay's first-ever pick (No. 7 overall). Linebacker Nick Perry of USC was the most recent in 2012.\n\nThe 75 first-round picks in between those two have ranged from players who have developed into franchise stars to those who made little or no contributions due to injury or simply lack of talent.\n\nHere's a list of the 10 biggest first-round draft busts in Green Bay's history.\n\n10. BRUCE CLARK\n\nDT, Penn State, fourth overall, 1980\n\nClark, an All-American and first junior to win the Lombardi Trophy, publicly stated he did not want to play as a nose tackle in Green Bay's 3-4 scheme.\n\nGeneral manager and head coach Bart Starr, in dire need of defensive help, drafted him anyway. Clark instead signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League for more money and in 1982 signed with the New Orleans Saints. He enjoyed a successful eight-year NFL career with the Saints (1982-'88) and Kansas City Chiefs (1989).\n\n9. RANDY DUNCAN\n\nQB, Iowa, first overall, 1959\n\nDuncan was the best quarterback in college football and the most sought-after player in the draft. He was a consensus All-American and a proven winner, leading the Hawkeyes to two Rose Bowl victories.\n\nThe strong-armed and athletic Duncan was just what the Packers and new head coach Vince Lombardi needed to rebuild from the worst season (1-10-1) in franchise history a year earlier.\n\nDuncan, however, chose to play in Canada for more money. He played two seasons in Vancouver before signing with the Dallas Texans in 1961. He threw one touchdown pass in nine games before retiring to begin a highly successful law career in Iowa.\n\n8. BRENT FULLWOOD\n\nRB, Auburn, fourth overall, 1987\n\nCoach Forrest Gregg overhauled the running game in the wake of a 12-loss 1986 season.\n\nGregg hoped Fullwood would help bolster the offense as a tough, dependable franchise-type back. The 5-foot-11, 209-pound back led the team in rushing in 1988 (483 yards) and 1989 (821 yards), earning a Pro Bowl berth.\n\nHis productivity fell to 124 yards a season later with numerous fumbles. In 1990, he pulled himself from a game due to an upset stomach and was subsequently traded to Cleveland, where he played in one final game.\n\n7. TERRELL BUCKLEY\n\nCB, Florida State, fifth overall, 1992\n\nBuckley was the first draft pick of the Mike Holmgren era.\n\nHe was an effective punter returner but was consistently targeted and beaten by larger receivers. He played three seasons and recorded 10 interceptions before signing with the Miami Dolphins in 1995. He played 14 seasons in the NFL with six teams and recorded 50 interceptions.\n\n6. AHMAD CARROLL\n\nCB, Arkansas, 25th overall, 2004\n\nThe Green Bay secondary was in dire need of upgrading after ranking 23rd in pass defense in 2003, including giving up the infamous fourth-and-26 reception in a season-ending playoff loss to the Eagles in Philadelphia.\n\nMike Sherman took two cornerbacks with his first two selections, including Carroll in the first round and Joey Thomas in the third.\n\nCarroll, 5-11 and 190 pounds, started 11 games his rookie season but was inconsistent and regularly beaten by taller and more physical receivers. He had only three interceptions in 27 starts from 2004-'05 before being traded to Jacksonville in 2006.\n\n5. JOHN MICHELS\n\nT, USC, 27th overall, 1996\n\nAh, what might have been. Ron Wolf was poised to select linebacker Ray Lewis with the 27th pick of the 1996 draft, but Baltimore beat him to the punch.\n\nWolf then chose Michels, a 6-7, 300-pound tackle from the tradition-rich USC program, to help protect league MVP Brett Favre.\n\nIn what was to be a Super Bowl winning 13-3 campaign, Michels started nine games but was slowed by ankle and knee injuries.

Did you think that they would play that way?\n\n\nGogoing : Well, I also think they're a really strong team.\n\n\nWell, honestly, even in the second game, we saw that Snake's team-fighting ability was really quite strong. They were also able to constantly pick fights with your team. In terms of shot-calling and communicating with your team, what did you do differently that allowed you to pick up the victory?\n\n\nGogoing : In the first game, they executed a couple of four-man shoves and, we've played against that kind of style before - we've had experience. In the second game, we had an answer and used a three-man push against them in return so we wouldn't have a huge deficit and so that we could, perhaps, gain an advantage instead.\n\n\nAre you the main shot-caller?\n\n\nGogoing : Yes.\n\n\nEveryone performed rather well on your team today in the second game. Even though Rengar had some timely ganks, Loveling was able to answer back and counter-gank twice with Jarvan IV. He was able to effectively contain those situations. Could you pick out someone on your team who played particularly well in the second game and give them a rating?\n\n\nGogoing : I think everyone played really well.\n\n\nWe know Snake has been gaining some incredible momentum in these past few weeks. Even you mentioned their early game in game one was really amazing.\n\n\nGogoing : Absolutely. I honestly would've never thought that they would use a strategy like that.\n\n\nCould you briefly tell us what you think about this dark horse team from what you've seen so far?\n\n\nGogoing : They're a very bold and consistent team. They also have a lot of unique strategies.\n\n\nNext time you face them, will you make any preparations leading to it? Do you feel the pressure?\n\n\nGogoing : We'll be pretty nervous since we haven't really faced them much before.\n\n\nBefore this, you were undefeated. We can say your winning streak ended today. Snake's mid laner [Baka] also seemed to be injured [reference: Baka fractured his elbow while filming a short segment called \"League of Legends: Fighting!\"] . How will prepare to play against them in your upcoming matches?\n\n\nGogoing : We're going to practice more countering them, and we'll have to put more thought into our team composition.\n\n\nWell, we hope that OMG can - especially since you've always been a rather strong team, a team that we've always paid attention to - fix your mentality and make it stronger and stronger. We're looking forward to your next match~ : Hello~: I think it has to do with the four-man shove that the other team executed in the beginning.

{"eta": "(Tom Newby Photography/Flickr)\n\nIdentifying journalistic cliches has become a favorite Washington parlor game. But might it not also open a rare window onto one of journalism's true problems?\n\nWhile the Washington Post and other major media outlets tend to treat jounalistic assumptions like North Korea's nuclear weapons, the practice can seem suspiciously benign in its appeal to the third person. Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, an apparent expert in the use of rhetorical tropes, has spoken publicly of the hyperbole and low standards of media as an antidote to the \"bleedin' obviousness\" of conventional journalism. (\"My police union doesn't feel safe anymore... We used to joke about that, about 'The meek shall inherit the earth,' but now we know it's just a line.\")\n\nIt's a fixation with the word itself, a lack of humility regarding the sheer number of cliches inherent to journalism, that pervades much of the argumentative style, says Jesselyn Radack, author of Who Reads the Washington Post?\n\n\"As journalist, you are very aware that you need to make a lot of assumptions,\" she says, speaking of her own style. \"But I think a lot of people can't get past that they want to make this word seem more like it actually does whatever its saying, when all of a sudden it can't. You see some people take it to extremes and be vindictive, and you lose all your credibility.\"\n\nRadack thinks the reflexive zeal of many post-journalismians towards a certain kind of conservatism is misguided. \"When it comes to race, Republicans and conservatives aren't sure what exactly they're after,\" she says. \"People on the left seem to be very caught up in class warfare, and on the right a lot of them are just incredibly hurt because they perceive that the media is a place where outsiders, if they're not like them or aren't a Democrat, are trying to destroy [them].\"\n\nShe thinks it's precisely this fear that can make some people skeptical of journalists' ability to make objective judgments about political topics that they see as affecting the well-being of everyday people. That, she says, is sometimes an impediment to increasing the number of diverse voices in newsrooms. While Radack encourages journalists to have a greater diversity of opinions, there's a tendency for them \"to set very clear rules about what counts as acceptable, but what isn't.\"\n\n\"You think people are going to be very skeptical, and you don't want to say a word in an echo chamber. And that happens,\" Radack says. \"But people don't really want to hear you saying anything. It's just that everybody lives in this bubble, so everyone is a little wary of you.\"\n\nThat point is made particularly clear when that bubble is a professional news outlet, say Radack.\n\n\"The power of that house is not just at one building, it is everywhere. There is no 'Well, I'm a conservative. What other groups have their biases?' That is never a problem. There are so many conservative organizations, and so many liberal organizations that if they don't all agree on something, you don't have an audience that we're losing.\"\n\nShe cites conservative journalism as one of a number of important measures of diversity being pushed in the nation's press.\n\nIn many ways, that's true. Indeed, a new Washington Post/ABC News poll indicates that the public at large (including those identifying as conservative) is more accepting of the left-leaning coverage. Perhaps more remarkable, though, is how much the poll shows that this approach differs among the editorial teams. Among team leaders, including those at the top of the paper's newsroom hierarchy, positive views of the press have increased by 26 percentage points. The partisan split for conservatives is up 15 points, while Democrats' perspective has grown by 13 points. (Given that the paper's trend line can be misleading, it's good to see that a shift in philosophy hasn't started a \"collapse of balance\" or that the pattern is permanent.)\n\n\"The clear question I wanted to explore is, were they people who share [their team's beliefs on the press] or are they people who don't?\" Radack says. \"And the results show us that those are two very different kinds of teams.\"\n\nCorrection 11/9/2016: An earlier version of this piece misstated the demographic makeup of the Washington Post editorial team. It has been revised.", "topp": "(Tom Newby Photography/Flickr)\n\nIdentifying journalistic cliches has become a favorite Washington parlor game. But might it not also open a rare window onto a group's core virtues?\n\nComedian Wyatt Cenac and entrepreneur Brian Krass joined forces a decade ago to transform a small online community called Infowars.com. (\"When you ask people to explain what Infowars is, more often than not, they start talking about its name,\" Cenac, 31, said in a phone interview. \"And by the way, I don't know that Infowars even exists anymore.\") Cenac, who is autistic and suffers from Asperger's syndrome, said that over the years, the site had grown into a media juggernaut, attracting television networks and top presidential candidates.\n\nAnd yet when Cenac and Krass launched Infowars.com two years ago, a White House term paper for George W. Bush did not need to accompany a news piece about Osama bin Laden's death. Replacing the old Harvard University tagline, \"know your enemy,\" they decided to \"let the verbal lickspittle fight it out in real life,\" as Cenac describes it. The new slogan\u2014\"Know your enemies, and do your job\"\u2014was so successful that Cenac and Krass\u2014two people who believe in nonviolence\u2014knew the White House would welcome the nickname.\n\nMembers of Infowars.com proudly carry homemade signs emblazoned with slogans like \"liberal, not liberal\"; \"Trump is NOT a Muslim\"; and \"Thank You, FBI\":\n\n(Tom Newby Photography/Flickr)\n\nWithin a few months, infowars.com had received the backing of the Trump campaign, and with it Cenac\u2014and so many other founders\u2014would lose their jobs for wearing and carrying signs. These days, Infowars is a quasi-mainstream site that happens to be sponsored by a pro-Trump media empire that BuzzFeed characterized last year as \"the New Yorker of internet conspiracy theories\" and \"bunk-hewn conspiracy facts.\"\n\nWhy did Trump see this as a great opportunity to get in on the Trump-supporter-centric ground game? Considering how many ordinary citizens donate money and emails to the Trump campaign\u2014almost all under the banner of supporting \"scientifically proven facts\"\u2014it's hardly surprising.\n\nFowler, who co-founded the US Health Insurance Services Board in 1989 after working for IBM and McDermott, is sanguine about the Trump campaign's influence. After starting USHIS in 1991, he helped craft health law this same year. Now vice president for government affairs, he said that the president wasn't \"a big voter,\" pointing to prior Administrations. And when it comes to health care, the law has been highly successful: The number of uninsured Americans by the end of 2015 was 40% less than the number who would be uninsured had Romney or Ryan become President.\n\nOne principle that really seems to resonate with Trump is one that had played out previously in the private sector: Pareto efficiency. Firm president Tom McIngvale, who spent much of his career in the industry, is a matter of pride that shareholders are only now being treated to a Pareto model of value: maximizing returns for investors at any cost. For example, he emphasized that USHIS' voluntary stock buyback program will give its shareholders nearly 70% tax savings\u2014and he plans to devote a great deal of attention to helping them use this opportunity.\n\nFowler believes that there are bright lines in the business landscape right now and, equally importantly, where they might not be if the country moves back to the past\u2014like when he spoke to executives from several people interviewed in later February. But Krumholz thinks that the \"changing national political discourse\" is ill suited for disruption. Trump was elected because of his outsider popularity. Where Americans say, to Fowler, that \"a heavy-handed federal government in other nations does a lot of things wrong, from free health care to abortion, he says to Krumholz, it makes things much more clear in the U.S. that government does a lot of things right.\" And if that changes, Fowler also notes that \"alternatives will emerge and grow at a speed that would have been unimaginable during the Obama years.\"\n\nChange, however, can take time to build. For that to happen, Fowler and Grissom believe that many of these founders will have to step away from the public stage or risk undermining their own reputations in a marketplace that demands honesty. \"I tell people how to think of themselves in the future,\" Fowler said. \"Let's not start over. \u2026 Those people who understand that [a vote for Trump] is like giving them money or something.\"", "human": "(Tom Newby Photography/Flickr)\n\nIdentifying journalistic cliches has become a favorite Washington parlor game. But might it not also open a rare window onto the struggles of writers and editors trying to think outside the box?\n\nOver the past few years, some colleagues at The Washington Post and I have played our own parlor game, assembling a list of verbal crutches, stock phrases, filler words, cliches and perpetually misused expressions that we should avoid in The Post's Sunday Outlook section \u2014 or at least think hard about before using.
